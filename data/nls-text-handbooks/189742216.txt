Introduction
Britain 1987 is the thirty-eighth official handbook in the series; it has
been prepared by the Central Office of Information on behalf of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The handbook is widely known as
an established work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference
facilities provided by British information services in many countries. It
is sold by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1987 describes many features in the life of the country,
including the workings of the Government and other major institu¬
tions. It does not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note whether
they refer to England, to England and Wales (considered together for
many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which
comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom
(which is the same as Britain, that is. Great Britain and Northern
Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in Britain 1987 is compiled with
the co-operation of other government departments and agencies, and of
many other organisations. Sources of more detailed and more topical
information (including statistics) are mentioned in the text and a guide
to official sources is given in Appendix 2.
The text, generally, is based on information available up to August
1986.

Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern
Ireland, and is one of the 12 member states of the European Community. Its full
name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The word Britain derives from Greek and Latin names probably stemming from
a Celtic original, which is also reflected in the name of the region of
north-western France (‘Brittany’ in English) settled by migrants from Britain in
the fifth and sixth centuries ad. Although, in the prehistoric time-scale, the
Celts were relatively late arrivals in the British Isles (following cultures which
had produced such notable monuments as the stone circles of Avebury and
Stonehenge) it is only with them that Britain emerges into recorded history, and
the term Celtic is often used rather generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
Following sorties by Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 bc, Britain was occupied by
the Romans in the first century ad and an ordered civilisation was established
under their rule for two or three hundred years except in the territory north of
Hadrian’s Wall (the wall across northern England planned by Hadrian, Roman
Emperor from 117 to 138 ad) and in some western areas. Christian missionaries
arrived not only in Roman Britain but also in Scotland and Ireland.
England and The final Roman withdrawal in the fifth century, however, followed a long period
Wales of increasing disorder during which there began raids on the island from
northern Europe—mainly by peoples traditionally described as Angles (from
Schleswig), Saxons and Jutes. It is from the Angles that the name England
derives. In the following two centuries the raids turned into settlement and the
establishment of a number of small kingdoms (with the Britons, or Celts,
maintaining an independent existence in the areas now known as Wales and
Cornwall). Among these kingdoms, more powerful ones which claimed over¬
lordship over the whole country were established, first in the north (North¬
umbria), then in the central area (Mercia) and finally in the south (Wessex).
However, the rise of Wessex in the ninth century under the leadership of Alfred
the Great (849—99) was contemporaneous with further raids and settlement
from Europe, in this case by the Vikings from Scandinavia. In the tenth century
the Wessex dynasty defeated the invading Danes and established a wide-ranging
authority in England. A second wave of Danish invasions, however, led to the
establishment of a Danish dynasty in England between 1017 and 1042, when
the Wessex line was restored.
The last successful invasion of England took place following a disputed
succession when Duke William of Normandy (a duchy established by the Vikings
and owing only nominal allegiance to the French king) enforced his claims by
defeating the English at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. There was considerable
settlement by Normans and others from France, French became the language of
the nobility for the next three centuries and the legal and, to some extent, social
structure was influenced by that which prevailed across the Channel. The
monarchy established by William and his successors was (except in intervals of
civil war) considerably more effective in administrative and military terms than

its predecessors and it began to establish its authority over increasingly wide
areas of the British Isles. This policy was pushed forward with most energy by
Edward I (1272-1307). His most lasting success was in Wales, the main
stronghold into which the Britons had retreated. With the death in battle in
1282 of the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the royal authority became firmly established
there. Edward gave his own heir the title of ‘Prince of Wales’ which has
subsequently been bestowed upon the eldest son of the sovereign. The rising led
by Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the fifteenth century showed strong
continuing Welsh national feeling but a new dimension to the situation was
provided by the accession to the English throne in 1485 of Henry VII of the Welsh
House of Tudor. Wales was politically assimilated to England under the Act of
Union in 1535.
A more difficult problem concerned relations between England and Scotland.
Hadrian's Wall had proved no insurmountable barrier between the Romans and
their northern neighbours, and far-reaching expeditions both by the Romans
into Scotland and by the Scottish people known as Piets into England took
place. In the sixth century the Scots from Ireland or ‘Scotia’ settled in the area of
Scotland now known as Argyll. Lothian was English in population, and Welsh
Britons moved north from the invading English into Strathclyde. A united
kingdom, under the Scots king Kenneth MacAlpine, emerged in the ninth
century while Scotland, like England, was endeavouring to defend itself against
the Vikings. The establishment of a powerful monarchy in England, however,
especially after the Norman Conquest in the eleventh century, was to pose an
intermittent but considerable threat to Scottish independence throughout the
Middle Ages and well into the sixteenth century.
The eventual unification of the crowns reflected the fact that, as a result of the
Reformation (a process which occupied most of the sixteenth century), old
national antagonisms had become less important than religious differences.
Following the death of the childless Elizabeth I in 1603, the Protestant James
Stuart, James VI of Scotland (son of Mary, Queen of Scots, whose grandmother
was a sister of Henry VIII), ascended the English throne as James I. England.
Wales and Scotland were henceforth known as Great Britain. Apart from the
union of the monarchies, however. England and Scotland remained separate
during the seventeenth century, except for an enforced unification by Oliver
Cromwell early in the period of the Commonwealth (1649—60) after he had
defeated royalist forces in Scotland. By the beginning of the following century
political and economic arguments for a closer union were apparent in both
countries. Eventually, in 1707, both sides agreed on the formation of a single
parliament for Great Britain although Scotland retained its own system of law
and church settlement. The Union was put under strain when Queen Anne died
in 1714 and George, Elector of Hanover (descended from a daughter of James I).
succeeded the Stuarts on the British throne. ‘Jacobite’ rebellions, aiming to
restore the Stuarts to the British throne, took place in 1715 and 1745 but were
unsuccessful.
In Ireland, out of a patchwork of Celtic and pre-Celtic peoples similar to that in
Britain, a number of kingdoms had emerged before the Christian era; any
supremacy established by one over the others in the following 1,000 years was of
a temporary nature. In cultural matters Ireland compared favourably with most
of Europe during the Dark Ages and Christianity survived in Ireland when it had
been displaced for the time being in England by Anglo-Saxon invaders. Ireland,
however, did not escape the incursions of the Vikings, who dominated the
country during the tenth century.
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an invasion of Ireland, the overlordship
LAND AND PEOPLE
3
of which he had been granted by the Pope, who was anxious to bring the Irish
church into full obedience to Rome. A large part of the country came under the
control of Anglo-Norman magnates but their descendants tended to assimilate
to their new country and little direct authority was exercised from England
during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
Henry VUI’s assumption of the title of King of Ireland in 1541 arose from his
desire to apply the Reformation settlement and thereafter the religious issue was
to produce far-reaching consequences. The determination to establish royal
authority in Ireland was strengthened during the reign of Elizabeth I by the fear
that the country might be used by Philip of Spain in his efforts to subjugate
England, and a series of campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents. The
main focus of the resistance was the northern province of Ulster and, with its
collapse in 1607, Ulster became an area of settlement by immigrants from
Scotland and England. (There was settlement by immigrants elsewhere in
Ireland, though on a lesser scale.)
The English civil war of 1642 to 1652 led to further risings in Ireland which
were crushed by Cromwell. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 was
followed by the accession of the Roman Catholic James II to the throne in 1685,
and there was more fighting after his deposition three years later in favour of his
nephew and son-in-law, the Protestant William of Orange and his wife Mary.
During most of the eighteenth century there was an uneasy peace and towards
its end various efforts were made by British governments to achieve stability. In
1782 the Irish Parliament (dating from medieval times) was given legislative
independence; the only constitutional tie with Great Britain was the Crown. The
Parliament represented, however, only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, who
had obtained possession of most of the agricultural land, and Catholics were
excluded from it. Against the background of an abortive rebellion in 1798 and
the prospect of intervention by France (with which Great Britain was at war
between 1793 and 1815) the Irish Parliament was induced to vote for union with
what, from 1801, was to be the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland.
The ‘Irish question' continued as one of the major problems of British politics
during the nineteenth century. In 1886 the Liberal Government introduced a
Home Rule Bill which would have given an Irish Parliament authority over most
internal matters while reserving to Britain control over external affairs. This led
to a split in the Liberal Party and the failure of the Bill. It was not until 1914 that
Home Rule was enacted by the Government of Ireland Act. Its implementation
was, however, prevented both by the threat of armed resistance on the part of
the Protestant majority in Ulster and by the outbreak of the first world war.
A nationalist uprising in Dublin in 1916 was suppressed, but with the end of
the first world war a guerrilla force known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the British administration. In 1921 a settlement was
reached under which six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament, but remained represented in and subject to the supreme
authority of the British Parliament, while the remainder of Ireland as the Irish
Free State (later to become the Irish Republic) became a self-governing state
outside the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Channel Islands Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the United
and Isle of Man Kingdom, they have a special relationship with it because of the antiquity of
their connection with the Crown. The Channel Islands were integrated into the
Duchy of Normandy in the tenth and eleventh centuries and have been
territories of the Crown since the Norman Conquest. The Isle of Man was under
the nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266 when it was ceded to Scotland,

subsequently passing to the Earls of Derby for a period but eventually coming
under the direct administration of the Crown in 1765. Today the territories are
Crown dependencies, with their own legislative assemblies and systems of local
administration and of law, and their own courts. The British Government is
responsible for their defence, their international relations and, ultimately, their
good government.
The position of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in the European
Community is broadly that the islands remain outside the Community except
for customs purposes and for certain aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Community provisions relating to the free movement of people and services do
not apply.
The Four Lands
In the following pages there are brief descriptions of a number of aspects of
social, economic and political life for each of the four countries, England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some additional material on the political
situation in Northern Ireland. (Statistics on the four lands are contained in
Table 1.)
England is predominantly a lowland country. There are upland regions in the
north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the south west in Devon and Cornwall. For the most part,
however, the country is undulating or flat and, in the south, crossed by low
ranges of hills including the Cotswolds and the Kent and Sussex Downs. The
greatest concentrations of population are in the London and Thames estuary
areas, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial cities, the midlands
conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east conurbations on the rivers
Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast.
The Church of England, which was separated from the Roman Catholic
Church at the Reformation, is the Established Church in England, with
privileges balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and appoints its two archbishops, 24 bishops
and some other senior clergy.
England has no government minister or department exclusively responsible for
its central administration of domestic affairs, in contrast to Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Instead, responsibility is shared among a number of
government departments, whose responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland. There are 523 Members of Parliament
for England in the House of Commons, and arrangements are made for the
discussion of regional affairs. Traditionally, of the two major political parties,
the Conservatives find their support chiefly in suburban and rural areas, while
the Labour Party derives its main support from urban industrialised areas. In
the 1983 election England returned 362 Conservative Members of Parliament,
148 Labour, 10 Liberal and 3 Social Democrat. Local government is adminis¬
tered through a two-tier system of counties subdivided into districts, except in
London, where local government is the responsibility of 32 borough councils
and the Corporation of the City of London. A major reorganisation of local
government was implemented in April 1986 when the Greater London Council
and the metropolitan county councils of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South
Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire were abolished
and most of their functions transferred to London borough and metropolitan
district councils.

Eight ‘standard’ regions in England are delimited principally for statistical
purposes: South East, East Anglia, South West, West Midlands, East Midlands,
Yorkshire and Humberside, North West and North. They play no part in local
government and do not always coincide with the regional units adopted by
central government departments.
The legal system of England comprises on the one hand a historic body of
conventions, known as ‘common law and equity , and on the other, parliamen¬
tary and European Community legislation. Common law stems from the work of
the king’s judges after the Norman Conquest of 1066 who sought to bring
together into a single body of legal principles the various local customs of the
Anglo-Saxons. Great reliance was placed on precedent, and the practice of
reporting on cases commenced in the thirteenth century. Equity law derives
from the practice of petitioning the king s Chancellor in cases not covered by
LAND AND PEOPLE
7
common law. The English legal system is therefore distinct from many of those
of Western Europe which have codes deriving from Roman law. The Habeas
Corpus Act 1679 is a fundamental statute forbidding imprisonment without
trial.
The Economy Up to the eighteenth century the English economy was mainly agrarian and the
chief manufacture was wool cloth. London as the capital city, and a major port
and mercantile centre, and the textile areas (East Anglia, south-western
England and West Yorkshire) were the most populous and prosperous regions.
In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, rapid growth took
place in the midlands, the north west, west Yorkshire and the north east, where
the coalfields and iron ore deposits permitted Britain to become the first
industrialised nation, basing its wealth on coalmining, on the manufacture of
iron and steel, heavy machinery and textiles, on shipbuilding and on trade.
London enhanced its position with the growing strength of the economy but
East Anglia and the west country, remote from areas of industrial development,
were affected by agricultural depression, and entered a period of relative decline.
In the twentieth century, the second period of industrialisation, based on new
sources of energy, new manufacturing industries and new forms of transport,
has continued to change the broad pattern of regional and industrial develop¬
ment in England. In the 1920s and 1930s the northern industrial centres saw
their traditional industries weakened owing to fluctuations in world trade and
competition from other industrialising countries and, in some cases, from
substitute products. London, its surrounding counties and the West Midlands
generally benefited from the newer, more mobile, industries. These included
chemicals (such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, plastics and artificial fibres),
electrical and electronic engineering, vehicle manufacture, aircraft building,
instrument engineering, aluminium and rubber manufacture and a wide range
of consumer goods, including processed food, drink and tobacco products as
well as durables.
In the second half of the century economic and population growth has tended
to favour smaller towns and rural areas, particularly those in the South West
and East Anglia. A number of industrial areas (in the North, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands) have suffered over the last
decade as a result of the decline in manufacturing employment. Through its
regional industrial policy the Government aims to reduce regional disparities in
employment opportunities by making investment incentives available in the
areas of greatest need, including those which have been dependent on declining
industries. Measures also exist to revive economic activity in inner urban areas.
East Anglia, still largely agricultural, has been the fastest-growing English
region in both population and employment since the 1960s. Particular growth
points have been Peterborough, the east coast ports (which, besides benefiting
from relative proximity to the northern European Community countries, have in
some cases become important bases for the development of gas resources in the
southern North Sea) and nine towns receiving population overspill from
London. Food processing, agricultural machinery, vehicle engines and elec¬
tronic and instrument engineering are the strongest industries, and the
service sector has been growing in Cambridge, Ipswich and Norwich.
Greater London and the industrial cities of the West Midlands, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside and the North continue to represent the largest
concentrations of manufacturing industry. London is an important area for
products of all kinds including food and drink (especially brewing), instrument
engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, clothing, furniture and
printing. Of importance in the surrounding south-eastern counties are oil
refining (along the Thames and near Southampton), pharmaceuticals, pumps.

valves and compressors, instrument engineering, electronics (particularly in
Berkshire and Hertfordshire, and around Chelmsford), motor vehicles, aero¬
space, building materials, timber, paper and plastics products. There is
diversity, too, in the North West, with significant activity in food processing
(especially grain milling, bread, flour confectionery and biscuits), chemicals,
textile machinery, insulated wires and cables, computers (Manchester being one
of the largest centres in the country), motor vehicles, aerospace, clothing, glass
making (with the world’s largest flat glass maker, Pilkington, in St Helens),
paper and rubber products. Lancashire is the centre of the cotton and allied
textile industries.
The characteristic manufactures of the West Midlands are metals (steel tubes,
iron castings and non-ferrous metals), machine tools, electrical engineering,
motor vehicles, carpets, pottery (with over 80 per cent of Britain s ceramics
industry located in Staffordshire) and rubber production. Of the other regions,
Yorkshire and Humberside has important shares of cocoa, chocolate and
confectionery production, iron and steel, machine tools, textile machinery,
woollen and worsted goods (producing about two-thirds of Britain’s wool
textiles), carpets, clothing and glass containers. The North has general
chemicals, iron and steel, process plant, marine engineering, and clothing; the
East Midlands has steel tubes, iron castings, over two-thirds of Britain’s hosiery
and knitted goods industry, and footwear; and the South West has food
processing (especially dairy products), aerospace and paper products.
In agriculture, the number of mixed holdings has been falling, as part of a
general tendency towards greater specialisation. Dairying is most common in
the west of England, where the wetter climate encourages the growth of good
grass; sheep and cattle are reared in the hilly and moorland areas of northern
and south-western England; and arable farming, pig and poultry farming and
horticulture are concentrated in the east and south. Horticulture is also
important in the West Midlands. Forestry is mainly found in the North, South
East and South West regions. The principal fishing ports are on the east coast
and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in its coalfields and has access to
offshore oil and gas reserves. About 60 per cent of Britain s deep-mined coal is
produced in the East Midlands and Yorkshire coalfields, the former being the
most productive in the country. The electricity grid of England and Wales is one
of the largest interconnected power networks under unified control in the
Western world. The world’s first large-scale nuclear power station was estab¬
lished at Calder Hall in Cumbria in 1956, while substantial investment in
reprocessing capacity is being undertaken nearby. Other nuclear power stations
are on coastal sites, including eight around the coasts of southern England.
Important mineral deposits in England include aggregates for the construction
industry (sand, gravel and crushed rock), industrial minerals (including clay,
salt from the North West and china clay from Cornwall), tin ore, also from
Cornwall, and iron ore from the East Midlands and Humberside. Water
resources include the Kielder Reservoir (Northumberland), one of Europe’s
largest man-made lakes.
A motorway network has been constructed in England since the 1950s and
comprises four long-distance arterial routes linking London and the cities of the
midlands, the North and North West and the South West, the London orbital
route (the last stages of which should be completed in 1986), and over 30 shorter
motorways. Inter-city travel has been improved by the introduction of high¬
speed rail services which are among the best in the world in speed, frequency
and comfort. Many ports have been equipped to deal with new developments in
shipping (such as container ships) and to take account of changes in the nature
of trade brought about by the increase in oil traffic through North Sea ports and
LAND AND PEOPLE

the growing proportion of trade with the continent of Europe. In January 1986
the British and French governments jointly announced their decision to
facilitate the construction of a fixed link across the Channel in the form of twin
single-track rail tunnels to carry through rail services, linking Britain directly
with the European rail system, and a drive-on, drive-off vehicle shuttle service
using specially designed shuttle trains. Construction could begin in 1987 and
the tunnel could be in operation in 1993. The major airports are Heathrow (the
busiest international airport in the world) and Gatwick, both serving London,
and Manchester, Luton and Birmingham. A decision was made in 1985 to
develop Stansted as London’s third airport.
Employment in service industries has accounted for an increasing share of
total employment in recent years, expansion being particularly marked in
financial and business services. London is one of the world’s leading centres of
banking, insurance and other financial services. Decentralisation of some office
services from the capital has led to a growth of office employment in the South
West and East Anglia in particular. London and the surrounding counties
account for much of advertising and market research activity, more than half of
all services offered by research establishments (other than those attached to
businesses), half of central government services and a significant proportion of
non-food wholesale distribution in England. After London and the South East,
the North West, with its main centre in Manchester, has the next most
important concentration of service industries. Tourism, catering and the leisure
industries have also expanded. Over half of expenditure by overseas visitors in
Britain takes place in London, while the South West is the most popular region
for domestic tourism. Each region has its own particular attraction for tourists.
For example, a number of areas including Northumberland and Cumbria (whose
peaks include Scafell, England’s highest point, at 978 m, 3,210 ft) have hills
and lakes which attract walkers, climbers and riders.
Cultural life in England takes so many forms that a brief summary can only
attempt to suggest its variety. London alone has about 100 theatres, including
some 40 in the ‘West End’, together with fringe and suburban theatres, about a
dozen major centres for music concerts, ballet and opera, four major art
galleries, a dozen major museums (with over 80 smaller galleries and museums),
some 400 public libraries, and over 140 West End, local and independent
cinemas, and other leisure facilities include discotheques, bingo halls, amuse¬
ment arcades, ice and roller skating rinks and swimming pools. With its cere¬
monial occasions, palaces, other historic buildings and shops, London is also
one of the world's leading tourist centres. About 15 attractions (Westminster
Abbey, the Tower of London, Madame Tussaud’s—an exhibition of waxworks of
famous people—the London Zoo, Kew Gardens and the major museums and art
galleries) each receive more than a million visitors a year.
Because of its size and its position as the capital city, London is not
representative of the rest of England, but much the same broad range of cultural
interests is reflected in many other cities and towns. The English Tourist Board
lists some 1,230 art galleries, museums and similar institutions in the rest of
England. Distinctive features of the northern industrial cities are special social
clubs, working men's clubs, which attract well-known entertainers. In addition,
many rural or outdoor recreations are strongly supported and there is active
interest in numerous games and sports, many of them having been devised in
England.
The English love of gardens and landscapes is associated with a tradition of
sightseeing visits to the many country houses, gardens and unspoilt rural and
coastal areas. There are seven national parks, two forest parks, some 32
designated ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’, about 150 country parks
10

The Economy
approved by the Countryside Commission, 550 ‘outstanding conservation
areas’, 620 km (385 miles) of designated heritage coastline and 1,900 historic
buildings and gardens listed by the English Tourist Board. Newer developments
include the opening of safari and wildlife parks and of‘theme’ parks devoted, for
example, to maritime history, which offer a diversity of entertainments as well.
Many regions and towns have associations with the great English writers and
artists, such as William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Arnold Bennett,
Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, Thomas Gainsborough and
John Constable.
Wales is a country of hills and mountains with extensive tracts of high plateau
and shorter stretches of mountain ranges deeply dissected by river valleys. The
highest mountains are in Snowdonia in the north west; the highest peak is
Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The lower-lying ground is largely confined to the
relatively narrow coastal belt and the lower parts of the river valleys. The main
areas of settlement are in the southern valleys and coastal areas, where
two-thirds of the population live. The chief urban centres are Cardiff, Swansea,
Newport and Wrexham. Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the
throne, was invested by the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon
Castle in 1969 when he was 20.
The country has its own Welsh language, spoken (according to the 1981
census) by 19 per cent of the population, chiefly in the rural north and west. The
Welsh name of the country is Cymru. Measures adopted since the 1960s have
helped to revive the use of the language, which is of Celtic origin and closely
resembles Breton, spoken in Brittany in France. They include recognising the
equal validity of Welsh with English in law courts, the encouragement of
bilingual education in schools, and the extended use of Welsh for official
purposes and in broadcasting. Welsh-language television programmes are
transmitted in Wales by Sianel 4 Cymru (Channel 4 Wales).
There is no established church in Wales, the Anglican church having been
disestablished in 1920 following decades of pressure from adherents of the more
evangelical Methodist and Baptist persuasions. Methodism in particular had
spread rapidly in Wales in the eighteenth century, assuming the nature of a
popular movement among Welsh speakers and finding strong support later in
industrial communities.
The country returns 38 Members of Parliament and there are special arrange¬
ments for the discussion of Welsh affairs. For the last 60 years the industrial
communities of Wales have tended to support the Labour Party in elections,
ensuring a Labour majority in Wales. In the 1983 election 20 Labour, 14
Conservative, 2 Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and 2 Liberal members were
returned. Substantial administrative autonomy is centred on the Secretary of
State for Wales, who is a member of the Cabinet, and has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy, welfare services and the provision of
amenities. The headquarters of the administration is the Welsh Office in
Cardiff, which also has an office in London. In 1979 proposals for the
establishment of an elected Welsh assembly in Cardiff to take over policymaking
and executive powers from central government were rejected in a referendum
held in Wales. Local government is exercised through a system of elected
authorities similar to that in England, and the legal system is identical with the
English one.
The south Wales coalfield was developed during the latter part of the industrial
revolution in the second half of the nineteenth century, creating populous urban
centres which drew labour from the rural areas and from England and Ireland.

However, the economy was narrowly based, mainly on coal, iron, steel and
tinplate, and contracted sharply during the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in
severe employment problems and substantial emigration.
Notable features of the past three decades have been the continuing
contraction of coalmining and iron and steel production (although Wales still
accounts for about one-third of Britain's steel production), the advent of a more
diverse range of manufacturing industries and the growth of service industries.
Wales is developing as an important centre for electronics in Britain and several
new high-technology businesses in electronics and related industries have been
established. Inward investment by overseas companies (especially Japanese and
United States high-technology concerns) has been considerable, and there are
over 200 overseas-owned or associated firms in Wales, employing about 50,000
people and accounting for around one in five jobs in the manufacturing sector.
South Wales remains the principal industrial area but new industries and firms
have also been introduced on the smaller coalfield in north-east Wales, around
Wrexham and Deeside, again to offset the decline in the older, basic industries
which previously dominated the area. Light industry has also been attracted to
the towns in the rural areas in mid- and north Wales and an important refinery
complex has developed around Milford Haven, which is one of Britain’s major oil
ports.
Agriculture occupies about 80 per cent of the land area, the main activities
being sheep and cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy farming in the
lowlands. Wales accounts for about 11 per cent of forest area in Britain and over
20 per cent of Forestry Commission timber production.
Wales produces about 7 per cent of Britain’s deep-mined coal and 14 per cent
of opencast production, including all of its anthracite. The biggest pumped-
storage power station in Europe is at Dinorwig, while there are nuclear power
stations at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd. Wales exports about a third of its water
supply to England.
Good communications exist in the south with motorway links across the
Severn Bridge to southern England and the midlands, and high-speed rail
services to a number of destinations in England, while the main road along the
north Wales coast is being upgraded.
There has been expansion in financial and business services, in the tourist
and catering trades and in some areas of public administration. With its coastal
resorts (which include Tenby, Saundersfoot, Rhyl, Llandudno, Colwyn Bay,
Porthcawl and Barry), and the attractions of three national parks (Snowdonia,
the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire Coast), as well as other areas of
picturesque hill, lake and mountain country, Wales attracts many tourists,
especially for outdoor holidays.
There is much literary, musical and dramatic activity in Wales and there is a
National Library and National Museum. Welsh literature is one of the oldest in
Europe. The country is well known for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. The special festivals of Wales, known as
eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh literature and music. The largest is the Royal
National Eisteddfod of Wales, held annually, entirely in Welsh, and consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and poetry. The town of Llangollen has
extended its eisteddfod to include artists from all over the world in the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. Famous modern Welsh artists have included
the opera singers Sir Geraint Evans and Dame Gwyneth Jones, the poet Dylan
Thomas and the actor Richard Burton. The politicians David Lloyd George
(former Prime Minister) and Aneurin Bevan were noted orators in a strong Welsh
tradition. An active local press includes a number of Welsh language publica¬
tions. Great interest is aroused by the annual rugby football competition in

which sides representing Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and France take
part.
Health services are provided mainly under the National Health Service,
administered by the Welsh Office, while personal social services and education
(except at university level) are provided mainly through the local authorities.
Educational provision is similar to that in England except for the use of Welsh in
some schools, particularly in the Welsh-speaking, largely rural, areas. The
collegiate University of Wales, founded in 1893, comprises seven member
institutions.
Scotland may be divided broadly into three areas: the sparsely populated
highlands and islands in the north, accounting for just over half the total area of
the country: the central lowlands, containing three-quarters of the population
and most of the industrial centres and cultivated farmland; and the Southern
Uplands, containing a number of hill ranges, which border on England. The
highest mountains are the Grampians in the central highlands, with Ben Nevis
(1,342 m, 4,406 ft) the highest peak. The chief cities are the capital Edinburgh,
the main industrial centre Glasgow, and the two regional centres Aberdeen and
Dundee.
The period from 1750 onwards has seen considerable and continuous
emigration of Scots to England and overseas. However, the rate slowed markedly
in the 1970s as the offshore oil and gas industries developed and there was
inward migration to the north east of Scotland, although the large outflow of
people from Strathclyde has continued, but at a lower level. In the mid¬
nineteenth century, as Scotland industrialised rapidly, there was large-scale
immigration from Ireland.
The period from 1750 until the beginning of the twentieth century was also
one of stability and economic progress and of achievements in many fields.
Among the famous men to emerge were David Hume, Robert Burns, Sir Walter
Scott, Adam Smith, Robert Adam, James Watt, John MacAdam, Lord Kelvin,
Alexander Graham Bell and James Clerk Maxwell.
The Church of Scotland, which became the established church in 1690, has
complete freedom in all matters of doctrine, order and discipline. It is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in form, being governed by a hierarchy
of church courts, each of which includes lay people.
There are special arrangements for the conduct of Scottish affairs within the
British system of government and separate Acts of Parliament are passed for
Scotland where appropriate. In the 1983 general election the 72 Scottish seats
in the House of Commons were apportioned as follows: 41 Labour, 21
Conservative, 5 Liberal, 3 Social Democrat, and 2 Scottish National. Since 1959
Scotland, like Wales, has had a majority of Labour Members of Parliament.
Administrative tasks relating to a wide range of economic and social functions
are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, a member of the
Cabinet, working through the Scottish Office, with its administrative head¬
quarters in Edinburgh and an office in London. A proposal for an elected
assembly for Scotland, on which a referendum was held in 1979, failed to gain
the support of the required 40 per cent of the electorate, even though a majority
of those voting gave it their approval.
Local government generally operates on a two-tier basis broadly similar to that
in England and Wales but established by separate legislation. The three islands
councils (for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles) are single-tier authorities.
The principles and procedures of the Scottish legal system (particularly in civil
law) differ in many respects from those of England and Wales, stemming, in
LAND AND PEOPLE

part, from the adoption of elements of other European legal systems, based on
Roman law, during the sixteenth century.
Scotland has experienced the same pressure on its traditional industries as the
north of England and Wales. The regional policies of successive governments
and investment by overseas companies have both made significant contribu¬
tions to the growth of modern, technologically based industries, and Scotland’s
economic structure is now broadly similar to that of Britain as a whole.
Engineering remains a major industry, accounting for over a quarter of the
manufacturing workforce, but there has been a significant trend towards lighter
engineering products and rapid expansion in electronics (including micro¬
electronics). By mid-1985 an estimated 280 plants were employing some 44,000
workers, one of the biggest concentrations of the electronics industiy in Western
Europe. Scotland accounts for over 50 per cent of Britain’s output of integrated
circuits and for 15 per cent of European output.
Another significant economic development in recent years has been the
substantial expansion of offshore-related industries following the discovery of oil
and gas under the northern North Sea. Some 100,000 jobs have arisen directly
or indirectly as a result of North Sea activities. Many of these jobs reflect overseas
investment solely related to the development of North Sea resources, but oil and
gas developments have stimulated other industries including engineering and
chemicals, reinforcing Scotland s position in the chemicals industry, especially
petrochemicals; the first phase of a major new plant at Mossmorran (Fife) was
opened in 1984. Traditional industries, such as coal, steel and shipbuilding,
have experienced a long-term decline in employment, but are still important
contributors to the Scottish economy. Other traditional manufactures, such as
high-quality tweeds and other textiles, and food and drink products, remain
important. There are about 100 whisky distilleries in Scotland and the industry
is a major export earner.
Northern and north-east Scotland (particularly Aberdeen) have benefited most
from offshore developments. However, Strathclyde, by far the most populous
region, has experienced serious industrial decline and population loss, particu¬
larly in Glasgow. In the remainder of the central belt and in the five new towns
(East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Livingston, Irvine and Cumbernauld) trends have
been generally more favourable. In Lothian the large concentration of financial
and other service industries centred on Edinburgh has been a helpful influence.
Scotland has about one-third of Britain’s total agricultural land, but 70 per
cent of it consists of hill grazing for cattle and sheep. About 11 per cent of the
agricultural area is used for crops, and 67 per cent of this is under barley.
Scotland accounts for nearly half of Britain's forest area and for 40 per cent of
public sector timber production; the bulk of new planting in Britain takes place
in Scotland, much of it in the upland and mountain areas. Fishing remains an
important activity; more than 65 per cent of total landings offish in Britain are
made by vessels based in Scotland.
Despite the advent of cheaper natural gas, Scotland still depends heavily on
electricity; nuclear and hydro-electric generation supply a higher proportion of
energy than in any other part of Britain. Large supplies of unpolluted water form
a major resource.
Communications, both domestic and international, have improved in many
areas, particularly in the north and north east, owing to the stimulus of the
offshore oil industry and to road- and bridge-building programmes. The offshore
oil industry has also encouraged expansion in financial and business services
which have been traditionally strong in Scotland.
Tourism, which makes a significant contribution to the economy and to
employment in Scotland as a whole, is estimated to generate, both directly and
14

Cultural and
Social Life
NORTHERN
IRELAND
indirectly, nearly 100,000 jobs. Scotland’s cultural and historic associations, its
varied scenic beauty, and the opportunities for sport and recreation are
particular attractions. Golf originated in Scotland, and courses at St Andrews,
Gleneagles, Turnberry and Prestwick are internationally renowned. Skiing is
growing in importance, with centres at Aviemore, Glenshee, Glencoe and the
Lecht, and further developments are planned.
A vigorous cultural life in Scotland has as its highlight the annual Edinburgh
International Festival, one of the world’s leading cultural events. Notable
performing arts bodies are the Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Opera,
Scottish Ballet, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Baroque Ensemble and
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Scotland possesses excellent collections
of the fine and applied arts, notably in the National Galleries of Scotland, the
Royal Museums of Scotland and the City of Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries
(including the Burrell collection, opened in 1983).
A language of ancient Celtic origin, Scots Gaelic is spoken by some 80,000
people mainly in the islands and north west of Scotland. It is the indigenous
language, with its own literary background. Scottish people in the lowlands have
for centuries spoken Scots (or Lallans), a derivative of the Northumbrian dialect
of Old English, which has its own recognised literary tradition and has seen a
revival in poetry in recent times.
An active press includes six national daily morning newspapers, six local
evening newspapers and three national Sunday newspapers. There are also
some 140 local weekly newspapers published in Scotland. Articles in some
papers are printed in Gaelic. Television programmes are produced by BBC
(Scotland) and by three independent companies, covering the highland, lowland
and border regions. BBC Radio Scotland covers most of the population and there
are five ‘community’ services in the highlands and islands, two of them mainly
in Gaelic, and two in the borders. Independent radio stations provide services
for Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee/Perth, Aberdeen, Ayr and Inverness.
Local authorities are responsible for the provision of most education, except at
university level. Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised
on comprehensive lines: colleges of further education are administered by
education authorities while independent bodies administer higher education
institutions and colleges of education. There are eight universities, of which
four (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) were established in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while the other four have been established
since 1964. The educational tradition has been particularly strong in Scotland,
helping many Scots to positions of eminence in the arts and sciences.
Over 50 per cent of Scotland’s housing has been built since 1945, only
Northern Ireland having a larger percentage. Scotland has a high proportion of
housing rented from public authorities (almost 50 per cent compared with a
national average of less than 30 per cent), although in recent years there has
been a noticeable growth in owner-occupied housing as in the rest of Britain.
Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It
has a 488-km (303-mile) border in the south and west with the Irish Republic. At
its centre lies Lough Neagh, Britain’s largest freshwater lake (381 sq km,
147 sq miles). Many of the principal towns lie in valleys leading from the Lough,
including the capital, Belfast, which stands at the mouth of the river Lagan. The
Mourne Mountains, rising sharply in the south east, include Slieve Donard,
Northern Ireland’s highest peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Just under two-thirds of Northern Ireland’s population are descendants of
Scots or English settlers who crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly in the
seventeenth century: most belong to the Protestant faith, and have a traditional
LAND AND PEOPLE

loyalty to the maintenance of the union with Great Britain. The remainder, over
a third, are Irish in origin and mainly Roman Catholic; many of them are
nationalist in political opinion, favouring union with the Irish Republic.
Government
Background to
Civil
Disturbances
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, but for 50 years from 1921 it
had its own devolved Parliament in which the mainly Protestant Unionists
consistently formed the majority and therefore constituted the Government after
successive elections. Nationalists, who are predominantly Roman Catholic,
resented this domination and their effective exclusion from political office.
Although substantial advances for the whole population were achieved in social
welfare and economic development, during the late 1960s an active and
articulate civil rights movement emerged. Reforms were made but sectarian
disturbances developed, which required the introduction of the Army in 1969 to
support the police in keeping the peace. Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from both sides, but most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army who claimed to be protecting the Roman
Catholic minority.
Direct Rule
and Political
Initiatives
Despite the Northern Ireland Government’s substantial reform programme, the
inter-communal violence continued and the United Kingdom Government
concluded that the best hope of ending terrorism and achieving political
progress would be for the United Kingdom Parliament and Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland
Government felt unable to accept this and resigned, and in 1972 direct rule
began, with a United Kingdom Cabinet minister responsible for the functions
previously exercised by the Northern Ireland Government.
Several attempts have been made to secure a stable and effective devolved
government supported by both sides of the community. A new constitution
which devolved powers to an elected legislative assembly, and a power-sharing’
executive representing all sections of the community, encountered Protestant
loyalist’ opposition culminating in a general strike in 1974; in 1976 an elected
constitutional convention failed to agree on a system of government that would
command widespread acceptance; in 1978 a planned framework for a form of
devolution to consolidate common ground among the political parties was
rejected; and in 1980 there was a political conference and extensive discussions.
In 1981 the appointment of a Northern Ireland Council to advise the Secretary of
State was proposed but rejected by the political parties in Northern Ireland.
In October 1982 elections took place to a new 78-member Assembly. The
Assembly was given responsibility for making proposals for devolving powers
on a basis which would command widespread acceptance throughout the com¬
munity. In the mean time, it performed scrutinising and consultative functions,
commenting upon draft legislation and initiating reports on such matters as
industry and education. Some members refused to take their seats on election.
The unionist parties, who had a majority in the Assembly, decided not to fulfil
the Assembly s statutory functions in March 1986 in protest at the Anglo-Irish
Agreement (see p 16), and in June the Government decided that the present
Assembly should be dissolved but at the same time expressed the hope that a
future Assembly would play a responsible part in Northern Ireland.
The Government's policy continues to be based on two fundamental prin¬
ciples. First, that there will be no change in Northern Ireland’s constitutional
status as part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a majority of people
in Northern Ireland. This is in accordance with internationally accepted
principles of democracy: it is also reflected in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. A
border poll in 1973 showed that a clear majority wished Northern Ireland to
remain part of the United Kingdom, and in subsequent elections parties which

and Security
Policy

support that position have continued to receive the majority of votes. Secondly,
the Government continues to believe that a devolved form of administration
would best meet Northern Ireland’s needs: but it will establish new structures of
devolved government only if they are acceptable to both parts of the community.
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to the United Kingdom Parliament.
The United Kingdom attaches importance to co-operation with the Irish
Republic and in November 1985 an Anglo-Irish Agreement was concluded
between the two Governments. The Agreement aims to promote peace and
stability in Northern Ireland, to create a new climate of friendship and
co-operation between the peoples of the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland and to improve co-operation in combating terrorism. It commits both
the United Kingdom and the Irish Governments in international law to the
principle that Northern Ireland shall remain part of the United Kingdom for as
long as that is the wish of a majority.
The Agreement established an Intergovernmental Conference through which
the Irish Government can put forward views and proposals on specified matters
affecting Northern Ireland affairs in so far as those matters are not the
responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland, and where
cross-border co-operation can be promoted in the interests of both countries.
Matters discussed include avoidance of discrimination; relations between the
security forces and the minority community; the administration of justice;
extradition and prison regimes; cross-border co-operation on security; economic
and social matters; human rights; electoral arrangements; and the use of flags
and emblems and of the Irish language. The conference has no executive role or
decision-making powers. There is no derogation from the sovereignty of either
the United Kingdom Government or the Irish Government as a result of the
Agreement; each retains full responsibility for the decisions and administration
within its own jurisdiction.
Since the present disturbances began, the Government has paid considerable
attention to protecting human rights in Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom
is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and allows the
right of individual petition. Legislation passed in 1973 outlaws discrimination
by public bodies, including the Government, on the grounds of religious belief or
political opinion. Discrimination in employment by both public and private
employers is also illegal and the Fair Employment Agency has been established
to investigate complaints and enforce fair practices. The independent Standing
Advisory Commission on Human Rights advises the Government on the
effectiveness of these measures and on other human rights issues.
While terrorism continues, certain emergency powers are in force. These
include special powers of arrest in respect of certain serious crimes; non-jury
courts to try those offences; and the proscription of organisations involved in
terrorism. There has been much concern, however, to reconcile these powers as
far as possible with respect for individual liberties: the measures are temporary,
need regular renewal by Parliament and have been subject to independent
review, most recently in 1984. Most traditional rights, including the freedom of
the media and the right to prosecute the security forces if they exceed their
authority, remain in force. There is also an independent police complaints
board. Northern Ireland’s legal system, and the safeguards it enshrines, is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales.
The use of violence as a means of overcoming political differences has been
condemned by the overwhelming majority of people living in Northern Ireland
and, although terrorism continues, the level of violence is much lower than some
years ago. The police take the primary role in maintaining order; the Army’s task
LAND AND PEOPLE
17
is one of assisting the civil authorities, and the number of soldiers on service has
been considerably reduced. Security policy rests on the principle of fair and
effective enforcement of the law by bringing terrorists to justice through the
courts. They are tried for criminal offences and not for political beliefs. At the
heart of the policy is a determination to develop the effectiveness of the police to
the point where military involvement in the maintenance of law and order is no
longer needed.
The Economy The geography of Northern Ireland has played an important part in shaping its
economic development. A situation on the western edge of Europe, with few
indigenous mineral resources and only a small local market, has tended to
favour the concentration of industry and population on the eastern seaboard
close to trading links with the rest of the United Kingdom. Most of Northern
Ireland s trade is with, or through, Great Britain. With certain exceptions, the
parts of the region beyond the immediate influence of the industrialised area
around Belfast have stayed predominantly rural, with generally small and often
scattered communities relying mainly on farming.
Since the end of the second world war two dominant trends have been
apparent in the economy. First, employment in the traditionally important
industries (shipbuilding, linen and agriculture) has declined. Secondly, there
has been growth in the numbers seeking work, reflecting the relatively high rate
of natural increase of the population, which is only partly offset by migration. In
an effort to counterbalance these factors and to promote growth, programmes
within the broad framework of United Kingdom regional policy have been
carried out to develop infrastructure and attract investment from within the
country and from abroad. Despite the impact of the world-wide recession in the
1970s and continuing high rates of unemployment, there have been encourag¬
ing developments in manufacturing recently and, as part of the Government’s
industrial development policy, the promotion of small firms to create new jobs in
manufacturing, crafts and services is meeting with success. The discovery of
large deposits of lignite around Lough Neagh, which offer the prospect of
cheaper electricity in the longer term, should also benefit industry.
Belfast has Britain’s largest shipyard, and aerospace engineering is now one of
Northern Ireland's biggest manufacturing industries. Other well-established
industrial activities include the manufacture of textile machinery and a wide
range of engineering products, tobacco and clothing. There has also been
extensive development in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronics,
telecommunications equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber. The linen
industry is enjoying a revival (farms are experimenting with growing flax) and
food processing and packaging is seen as a source of new employment.
Agriculture (predominantly livestock and products) is still an important
industry, accounting for almost a tenth of civil employment (including the
self-employed), over three times the proportion in Britain as a whole.
To meet the special problem of unemployment rates that are persistently
higher than in any of the other standard regions of Britain, successive
governments have offered more generous incentives than are available in the
rest of the country to encourage new investment both from within Britain and
from overseas, and assistance to mitigate high energy costs. The establishment
of enterprise zones in Belfast and Londonderry and the designation of
Aldergrove airport as a ‘freeport’ serve as additional incentives to investment.
Northern Ireland's productivity and industrial relations records compare
favourably with those in the country as a whole. Altogether more than 400
manufacturing projects which have been assisted are still in production,
including some 100 from outside Northern Ireland.
The modern diversification of the economy has helped to stimulate output,
18
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cultural and
Social Life
productivity and incomes, and has assisted in narrowing the gap between living
standards in Northern Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Gross domestic product per person, which tends to be depressed in Northern
Ireland relative to the country as a whole, has nonetheless risen from just under
two-thirds of the British average in 1963 to almost three-quarters. Average
earnings are more than nine-tenths of the national average.
The principle underlying Northern Ireland's financial relations with the rest of
the country is that it has parity, both of taxation and services, with England,
Scotland and Wales. To maintain social services at the level of those in Great
Britain, to meet the cost of security measures, and to compensate for the natural
disadvantages of geography and lack of resources, the United Kingdom
Government’s subvention to Northern Ireland in 1985-86 was nearly £1,600
million.
i
In day-to-day social life Northern Ireland is in many ways similar to the rest of
the United Kingdom. For thousands of visitors (863,000 in 1985), as well as for
local people, Northern Ireland’s landscape and natural features, its cultural
traditions and festivals continue to offer special attractions. For many North
Americans the land from which their forebears emigrated (a number of United
States presidents have been descended from Northern Ireland families) has a
unique interest. The story of this contribution to American life, the history of
Northern Ireland, and aspects of its culture—from the dialects and strong
literary tradition (poets like Louis MacNeice and Seamus Heaney have inter¬
national reputations) to the songs and dances and folk art—are recorded in the
Ulster-American Folk Park, the Ulster Museum and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland is a major contributor to cultural life,
which encompasses classical and traditional music, opera, literature and
poetry, drama, ballet and the visual arts. The annual Belfast Festival at Queen's
University is the second largest international festival in Britain. Among
musicians who have achieved international distinction are the flautist James
Galway and the soprano Heather Harper; the pianist Barry Douglas won the
International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1986.
The National Health Service provides both hospital and practitioner services,
and health and personal social services correspond fairly closely to those in the
rest of the United Kingdom, although the administrative framework is different.
While publicly maintained schools are open to children of all religions, in
practice, Protestants and Roman Catholics are for the most part educated in
separate schools, although there is one publicly maintained integrated school
and a small number of independent integrated schools. Contrary to develop¬
ments in the rest of the United Kingdom, emphasis on the comprehensive
principle in secondary schools has been very small. Links between the two
universities and industry are well developed. Housing and the improvement of
the urban environment have presented problems for the authorities, but
considerable progress has been made, notably in Belfast, and home ownership is
increasing significantly. Major new town centre developments are taking place
in Belfast, Londonderry and other towns which provide greatly improved
shopping facilities. Planning and conservation arrangements are much like
those in the rest of the country.
Distinctive local programmes are broadcast and there is a local press; national
radio and television networks are received, however, and the national press is
sold widely. Sport has an important role in the community, and many
world-class sportsmen and sportswomen have come from Northern Ireland,
including the boxer Barry McGuigan and the snooker player Dennis Taylor.
LAND AND PEOPLE
19
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a geographical term for a
group of islands lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest
of the islands is Great Britain (the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland).
The next largest comprises Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south west are
the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by the
large archipelago known as the Hebrides and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these have administrative ties with
the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands
between Great Britain and France are largely self-governing, and are not part of
England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Britain’s area is some 244,100 sq km (94,250 sq miles), of which nearly 99
per cent is land and the remainder inland water. This is about the same size as
the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand or Uganda, and half the size of
France. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles) from the south coast to the
extreme north of Scotland and just under 500 km (some 300 miles) across in the
widest part. There are numerous bays and inlets and no place in Britain is as
much as 120 km (75 miles) from tidal water. The prime meridian of 0° passes
through the old observatory at Greenwich (London).
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow, usually less than 90 m (50
fathoms or 300 ft), because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the north
west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 180 m (some
600 ft) to 900 m (about 3,000 ft). The shallow waters are important because
they provide breeding grounds for fish. The warming effect on the air of the
North Atlantic current is magnified as its water spreads across the shelf.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions moving eastwards across the Atlantic. The weather is subject to
frequent changes but to few extremes of temperature. It is rarely above 32°C
(90°F) or below — 10°C (14°F). Near sea-level in the west the mean annual
temperature ranges from 8°C (46°F) in the Hebrides to 11°C (52°F) in the extreme
south west of England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The
mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges
from 3°C (37°F) during the winter (December, January and February) to 1 TC
(52°F) during the summer (June, July and August); the corresponding figures
for the Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (41°F) and 16°C (61°F). The
average annual rainfall is more than 1,600 mm (over 60 inches) in the
mountainous areas of the west and north but less than 800 mm (30 inches) over
central and eastern parts. Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on average, March to June are the driest months and September to January
the wettest. The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south
to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During
May, June and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight; during the months of shortest daylight (November, December and
January) sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of an hour a day in
northern Scotland and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
The Social Framework
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly in the second
half of the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes
include a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher divorce rate.

widening educational opportunities, technical progress and a higher standard
of living.
With 56-6 million people in 1985, Britain ranks about fifteenth in the world in
terms of population. This compares with 38-2 million in 1901, about 9 million at
the end of the seventeenth century and some 2 million at the end of the eleventh
century. Early figures are based on contemporary estimates, but from the
beginning of the nineteenth century relatively plentiful and reliable information
is available. Most of it comes from two main sources: the regular flow since 1837
of statistical information based on compulsory registration of births, marriages
and deaths, and the censuses taken regularly every ten years since 1801
(because of war there was no census in 1941). The most recent was in April
1981. After 1975 the population fell slightly for about three years, for the first
time (other than in war) since records began, reflecting a temporary decline in
the birth rate. Since then the upward trend has been resumed, except for a
slight decline in 1982. Projections for the future suggest that population growth
will take place at a low rate. Britain's total population is expected, on mid-1985
projections, to be 56-8 million in 1991, 57-7 million in 2001 and 58 million in
2011.
In 1985 there were 752,000 live births in Britain, 22,500 more than in 1984,
which outnumbered deaths (666,900) by 85,100. The total period fertility rate
(an indication of the average size of family) remains below the level of 21
required for the replacement of the population, although it increased to 1-80 in
1985 from 1-77 in 1984.
Several factors may have contributed to the relatively low birth rate.
Contraception has become more widespread and effective, making it easier to
plan families, and voluntary sterilisation of men and women has also become
more common. An appreciable proportion of pregnancies (in 1984 about 37 per
cent of those conceived outside marriage and 7 per cent of those conceived
within marriage) are ended by legal abortion.
The postponement of conception within marriage coupled with a trend
towards later marriage has led to an increase, to 26, in the average age at which
women have their first child in marriage. Another feature is the current
preference for smaller families than in the past, especially two-children families,
which has led to a significant decline in the proportion of families with four or
more children.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is about 70 years and for a woman 76
years compared with 49 years for men and 52 years for women in 1901. The
improving health of the population has mainly had the effect of increasing
young people’s chances of reaching the older age groups. Life expectancy in the
older age groups has increased relatively little.
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population. However, there has been a considerable decline
in mortality at most ages, particularly among children and young adults. The
infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births)
was 9-6 in 1984; neonatal mortality (deaths of infants under four weeks old per
1,000 live births) was 5-7 in 1984; and maternal mortality is about 0-1 per 1,000
live births.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising
standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene, and the smaller size of families. Deaths resulting from
infectious diseases (notably tuberculosis) have virtually disappeared. Deaths

caused by circulatory diseases (including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, the next largest cause of death being cancer
(responsible for nearly one-quarter of deaths).
During the last 20 years there has been a marked change in the pattern of
marriage. In 1972 there were 480,300 marriages in Britain, but by 1982 the
number had declined to 387,000, with a subsequent increase to 393,249 in
1985. Of the population aged 16 or over in England and Wales in 1985, 61 per
cent were married, 25 per cent single, 9 per cent widowed and 5 per cent
divorced. The trend of the 1960s towards earlier marriage was reversed at the
beginning of the 1970s, since when there has been a slow increase in the
average age for first marriages, which in England and Wales is now nearly 26 for
men and nearly 24 for women. In 1985 remarriages (of one or both parties)
accounted for about 36 per cent of all marriages in England and Wales,
compared with about 20 per cent in 1971 and 15 per cent in 1961. Some 12 per
cent of all marriages in 1985 were remarriages where both partners had been
divorced.
The divorce rate has been increasing steadily and in 1985 about 13 decrees of
divorce were made absolute for every 1,000 married couples in England and
Wales, compared with two per 1,000 in 1961. The rates are lower in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. In 1985 about 160,300 divorces were granted in England
and Wales; the proportion granted to wives was about 72 per cent. The average
age of people at the time of divorce in England and Wales is now about 37 for
men and 35 for women.
Another feature, common to many other Western European countries, has
been a considerable increase in cohabitation. Nearly one-quarter of women in
Great Britain mariying during the period 1979 to 1982 where the marriage was
the first for both parties had lived with their husbands before marriage
(compared with 8 per cent in the early 1970s) and about 12 per cent of
non-married women aged 18 to 49 were cohabiting during 1983-84. Cohabita¬
tion occurs more frequently for separated or divorced women than for single
women. There is some evidence of a growing number of stable non-married
relationships in that half of illegitimate births (which now account for more
than 19 per cent of live births in Britain compared with 6 per cent in 1961) are
registered by both parents.
Although the total population has remained relatively stable in the last decade,
there have been noticeable changes in the age and sex structure, including a
decline in the proportion of young people under 16 and an increase in the
proportion of elderly people, especially those aged 85 and over. The estimated
age distribution of the British population in mid-1985 was roughly as follows-
under 16 years, nearly 21 per cent; 16-64, 64 per cent; and 65 and over, 15 per
cent. Some 18 per cent of the population were over the normal retirement ages
(65 for men and 60 for women), compared with 15 per cent in 1961.
In mid-1985 there were an estimated 29 million females and 27-6 million
males in Britain, representing a ratio of over 105 females to every 100 males.
There are about 6 per cent more male than female births every year. Because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point, at
about 51 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number of
men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance of
women among the elderly.
The population density is about 239 per sq km, which is relatively high in
comparison with most other countries. England is the most densely populated
with 361 people per sq km (with Greater London having a density of 4,283
22
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Migration
people per sq km), and Scotland the least densely populated with 65 people per
sq km, while Wales and Northern Ireland have 135 and 111 people per sq km
respectively.
Table 2 gives figures for some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half of
the population lives in a belt across England, with south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire at one end, the London area at the other, and the industrialised
midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are: the central
lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the river Tyne down to
the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast
from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the eastern
fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and the far south
west. Most of the mountainous parts, including much of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland and the central Pennines, are very sparsely populated.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a general trend, especially in
London, for people to move away from the congested urban centres into the
suburbs. The 1981 census recorded that only in the remoter rural areas had the
rate of population growth been higher in the 1970s than in the 1960s. There has
also been a geographical redistribution of the population from Scotland and the
northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South West and the East
Midlands. Another feature has been an increase in the rate of retirement
migration, the main recipient areas (where in some towns the elderly can form
over one-third of the population) being the south coast of England and East
Anglia.

Traditionally, there is a net population loss from Britain due to migration to the
rest of the world, but in 1985, when the inflow was 34 per cent higher than in
1984, there was a net gain of 97,000.1 Between 1980 and 1985 some 1-24
million people left Britain to live abroad and about 1-20 million came from
overseas to live in Britain, so that net emigration reduced the population by
about 41,000. Of the 174,000 departing residents in 1985, 19 per cent left for
Australia, Canada or New Zealand, 18 per cent for other Commonwealth

countries, 17 per cent for other European Community countries, 14 per cent for
the United States and 10 per cent for the Middle East. Of the 270,000 new
residents, 14 per cent came from Australia, Canada or New Zealand, 21 per cent
from other Commonwealth countries and 20 per cent from other European
Community countries. Many of those coming into Britain, as well as those going
abroad, are British citizens.
Nationality legislation is embodied in the British Nationality Act 1981, which
came into force on 1 January 1983. Under this Act, citizenship of the United
Kingdom and Colonies was replaced by three citizenships: British citizenship
for people closely connected with Britain, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of
Man; British Dependent Territories citizenship for people connected with the
dependencies; and British Overseas citizenship for those citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies who did not acquire either of the other citizenships. With
one small exception, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had the
right of abode in Britain when the Act came into force acquired British
citizenship.
British citizenship is acquired automatically at birth by a child born in Britain
if his or her father or mother is a British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a British citizen. A child born abroad to
a British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or registered in Britain is a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the citizenship of a child born abroad to a
British citizen in Crown service, certain related services, or in service under a
European Community institution. British citizenship may also be acquired by
registration by certain children born in Britain who do not automatically
acquire such citizenship at birth or born abroad to a parent who is a citizen by
descent; by British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens,
British subjects under the Act (three very limited categories) and British
protected persons after five years’ residence in Britain (except for people from
Gibraltar, who may be registered without residence); and by naturalisation for
Commonwealth citizens, citizens of the Irish Republic, and foreign nationals.
The British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 conferred British citizenship
(with effect from 1 January 1983) on those Falkland Islanders who did not
acquire it under the 1981 Act. For naturalisation, which is at the Home
Secretary s discretion, five years' residence, good character and sufficient
knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic are required except for the
spouse of a British citizen, who needs only three years’ residence and no
language qualification. Most existing entitlements to registration (including
those for Commonwealth citizens and Irish citizens settled in Britain since
before 1973, and in certain circumstances that for women married to citizens of
the United Kingdom and Colonies before 1983) are preserved for five years from
1 January 1983.
Special arrangements covering the status of British Dependent Territories
citizens living in Hong Kong when the territory returns to the People’s Republic
of China in 1997 are made by the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986
In 1985, 54,000 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation or registration
in the United Kingdom.
Immigration into the United Kingdom is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971
(as amended by the British Nationality Act 1981) and the Immigration Rules
made in accordance with the Act. British citizens under the British Nationality
Act 1981 and those Commonwealth citizens who had the right of abode before
1 January 1983 (when the 1981 Act came into force) have the right of abode and
are not subject to immigration control. Those who do not have this right require
permission to enter and remain in the United Kingdom, which is given in
24

accordance with the rules. These, which are approved by Parliament and which
may be changed from time to time, set out the requirements to be met by those
seeking entry whether in a temporary capacity, for example as students or
visitors, or with the intention of taking employment or setting up in business or
for settlement as the dependants of a person already settled in the United
Kingdom. Nationals from certain countries require a visa before they can enter
the United Kingdom. Other nationals subject to immigration control require
entry clearance when coming to settle in the United Kingdom and in certain
other circumstances. Visas and other entry clearances are normally obtained
from the nearest British diplomatic post in a person's home country. Changes to
the rules were implemented in 1985 to remove differences relating to the
admission of husbands and wives coming for settlement and in 1986 to prevent
child spouses under 16 living in the United Kingdom.
In accordance with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Treaty of
Rome, European Community nationals do not require entry clearances nor are
they subject to restrictions on their freedom to take or seek work. The United
Kingdom similarly respects its obligations under the United Nations Convention
and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.
In 1985, 55,400 people were accepted for settlement, some 4,400 more than in
1984. A third of these were from the South Asian sub-continent and over half
were the wives and children of men settled in the United Kingdom.
This section deals (to some extent in broad and informal terms) with social
developments affecting many sections of the population.
The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in
families or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people
in the armed services and in educational or other institutions. In 1984 just
under four-fifths of people living in private households lived in a unit headed by
a married couple.
Among many changes in household and family structure is the continuing fall
in the average size of households in Great Britain from over four people in 1911
to 3-09 in 1961 and 2-59 in 1984. The fall reflects a greater proportion of people
living on their own (8 per cent) or in one-parent families, the increasing number
of elderly people (more of whom are living alone), and the preferences of parents
for smaller families. The trend towards smaller households (25 per cent of
households consist of one person) is expected to continue and the number of
one-person households is forecast to increase substantially in the next few
years.
A growing proportion of households, about 60 per cent, own or are buying their
own homes, owner-occupation being higher among married couples than for
single, divorced or widowed household heads. The number of owner-occupied
dwellings rose from over 4 million in 1951 to 13-5 million in 1984. Four British
households out of five live in houses rather than flats.
Nearly half of Britain's housing has been built since 1945. Recent housing
developments have been concentrated in suburban areas. Many families now
live in houses grouped in small terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually
of two storeys with gardens, and providing two main ground-floor living rooms,
a kitchen, from two to four bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories.
Originally, many houses were located in ribbon development along main roads,
but in recent years housing estates have nearly always been sited away from
main roads. In inner urban areas slum clearance and redevelopment have been
major features of post-1945 public housing programmes. While high-rise flats
were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the emphasis in new building is now on
low-rise, high-density designs, often incorporating gardens or patios.

Standards
Housing standards are continually improving; some 97 per cent of households
in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and a similar proportion
sole use of an inside lavatory (high percentages by international standards)
while over 65 per cent have central heating.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership; about 61 per cent of households have the use of at least
one car (or van), including 17 per cent with the use of two or more. Greater
access to motorised transport and the construction of a network of modern
trunk roads and motorways have resulted in a considerable increase in personal
mobility and changed leisure patterns, and have influenced the design of
housing estates and shopping areas. Most detached or semi-detached houses in
new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-town shopping centres, which
normally include large supermarkets, are usually planned for the motorist.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution arising from motor vehicle emissions. Public transport,
too, has been affected, and many services have been reduced or withdrawn,
especially local bus and train services in rural areas. However, greater
competition in express coach services has resulted in more long-distance and
commuter coach services being provided.
There has been a steady reduction of the main atmospheric and freshwater
pollutants that have been of concern in the past, producing dramatic improve¬
ments in, for example, the quality of the air in cities and the condition of major
rivers, although various forms of pollution from traffic and industrial processes
remain a problem in some areas. There is a high degree of concern for the
environment, as shown by the growth in the number of organisations (especially
voluntaiy societies) concerned with conservation.
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth centuiy, but generally at a slower rate than in some other major
industrialised countries. Although gross domestic product (GDP) per head fell in
the early 1980s, Britain has experienced an economic recovery in the mid-
1980s, and GDP is now at a record level, having risen by 3-6 per cent in 1985.
Another feature of the economic improvement has been a substantial reduction
in inflation, which from 1983 to 1985 ranged between about 4 and 7 per cent a
year, compared with an average annual increase of 14-2 per cent between 1973
and the end of 1982, and was down to 2-4 per cent in mid-1986, the lowest rate
since 1968.
Long-term trends in the pattern of expenditure show a substantial rise in
expenditure on housing, televisions, telephones, electrical and some other
durable goods, motor vehicles and entertainment, and in expenditure overseas.
As real incomes have risen, the share of expenditure on food has fallen Unlike in
many other countries, the share devoted to tobacco continues to decline; an
increasing number of people have stopped smoking for health reasons.
The general level of nutrition remains high. Over the last 20 years there have
been substantial rises in the consumption of poultiy, instant coffee, pork,
margarine and processed (including frozen) vegetables, while home consump-
lon per person of mutton and lamb, beef and veal, bread, potatoes, eggs, milk,
butter, sugar, tea and some other foods has fallen. However, another feature has
been an increase in the number of meals eaten away from home, either at work
or in restaurants, and a growth in the consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and
tast-food‘ shops. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the proportion of
convenience foods eaten grew as women increasingly went out to work and had
less time to prepare meals, and as the variety of prepared foods rose in line with
the growth in ownership of refrigerators and freezers; there is some evidence of a
26

Availability of Certain Durable Goods
Per cent of households with goods
more recent return to fresh foods, as well as growth in the popularity of health
foods and slimming products.
Alcohol consumption has risen substantially since the 1950s and alcohol
abuse has become a growing problem although the level is well below that in
some other European Community countries. Beer remains much the most
popular alcoholic drink. A high proportion of beer is drunk in public houses
(‘pubs'), which are a traditional social centre for many people, and in clubs. A
notable development has been the increase in consumption of lager, now
estimated to account for about two-fifths of the beer consumed. Consumption of
light (table) wine has increased considerably in recent years, although there has
been little change in the consumption of higher strength wines such as sherry
and port. The pattern of spirits consumption has also been changing, with a
decline in the consumption of whisky and gin, and higher consumption of some
other spirits.
Ownership of many durable goods has been increasing and some goods, such
as televisions, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators, are available in more than 90
per cent of households. Of durable goods shown in the diagram above,
ownership of telephones, freezers and central heating systems is growing most
rapidly; other durable goods which have grown in popularity include music
centres and other audio equipment, video recorders and home computers.
The pattern of employment has altered considerably in recent years, with a
substantial decline in employment in manufacturing industry being accom¬
panied by a long-term increase in the numbers employed in service industries.
The number of jobs in the economy has increased, but unemployment has also
grown as demographic factors have contributed to a substantial increase in the
population of working age. A recent feature has been a rapid growth in the
number of self-employed, accounting in September 1985 for over 10 per cent of
LAND AND PEOPLE
27
Women

Opportunities
the workforce. Earnings from employment are the main source of income for
most people; in 1984 wages and salaries accounted for 61 per cent of household
income. The distribution of pre-tax income has remained relatively stable over a
long period, the lower 50 per cent of income earners accounting for some 22 to
24 per cent of pre-tax income since 1949. However, the share of the top 1 per
cent fell from 11 per cent in 1949 to 5-3 per cent in 1978-79, but increased to 6
per cent in 1981-82. Income before tax of the self-employed is less evenly
distributed than total income, mostly because of the very large incomes of a
small number of people, mainly professionals such as lawyers, accountants and
doctors. The combined effect of the tax system and the receipt of benefits is to
redistribute incomes on a more equal basis.
Wealth is much less evenly distributed, with the top 1 per cent of the
population aged 18 or over owning about 21 per cent of marketable wealth, the
top 10 per cent having 56 per cent and the top 50 per cent having 96 per cent.
The inclusion of non-marketable' rights in occupational and state pension
schemes reduces these shares substantially to around 11, 34 and 80 per cent
respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has been little change in the distribu¬
tion of marketable wealth or in that of marketable wealth plus occupational and
state pension rights.
Considerable changes have occurred in the twentieth century in the economic
and domestic lives of women, due, in part, to the removal of almost all sex
discrimination in political and legal rights. At the heart of women’s changed role
has been the rise in the number of women, particularly married women, at work
With later marriages and the availability of effective methods of family planning
there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved in
child-bearing for a much shorter time and this, together with a variety of other
factors which have made housework less burdensome, has made it possible for
women with even young children to return to work.
Women comprise about two-fifths of the British labour force. Since the second
world war the proportion of married women who work has grown to over 60 per
cent of those between the ages of 16 and 60, and they now make up some 28 per
cent of the labour force compared with 4 per cent in 1921. Many families have
come to rely on married women’s earnings as an essential part of their income.
There is still a significant difference between women’s and men’s earnings but
the equal pay legislation which came into force at the end of 1975 has narrowed
the gap. Women s average hourly earnings, exclusive of overtime (for full-time
employees), increased from just under two-thirds of those of men in 1970, to
nearly three-quarters in 1985. Nevertheless, women’s wages remain relatively
low because women tend to work in lowly paid sectors of the economy and they
work less overtime than men.
These changes have been significant, but, because tradition and prejudice can
still handicap women in their careers and personal lives, major legislation to
help to promote equality was passed in the 1970s.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 as amended in 1984 (there is similar legislation
in Northern Ireland), women in Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with men
when doing work that is the same or broadly similar, or work which is of equal
value. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes discrimination between men and
women unlawful in employment, education, training and the provision of
housing, goods, facilities and services. Discriminatory advertisements which
breach the Act are also unlawful. (Northern Ireland has similar legislation.) The
Sex Discrimination Bill at present before Parliament will bring the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 into line with certain European Community directives,
including one relating to the right of women to continue working until the same

age as men in those occupations which have different retirement ages for men
and women. In most cases complaints of discrimination are dealt with by
industrial tribunals since they concern employment; others may be taken before
the county courts in England and Wales or the sheriff courts in Scotland. The
Equal Opportunities Commission was set up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland
under separate legislation) to enforce the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal
Pay Act. Its statutory duties are to work towards the elimination of discrimina¬
tion and to promote equality of opportunity. The Commission advises people of
their rights under both Acts and may give financial or other assistance to help
individuals to conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It also has power to
conduct investigations and to issue notices requiring discriminatory practices
to stop. In addition, it keeps legislation under review and may submit proposals
for amending it to the ministers concerned. The Commission seeks to make
women more aware of the opportunities available to them and its information
centre is a national source of material on all aspects of equality.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the last
three hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some to
avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life or an
escape from poverty.
The Irish have long made homes in Britain. Many Jewish refugees started a
new life in the country towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the
1930s, and after 1945 large numbers of other European refugees settled in
Britain. The large communities from the West Indies and South Asian
sub-continent date principally from the 1950s and early 1960s. There are also
sizeable groups of Americans, Australians, Chinese and various European
communities such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. More
recently Ugandan Asians and refugees from Indo-China have settled in Britain.
In 1984, according to the results of a sample survey, the non-white population
of Great Britain was nearly 2-4 million (just over 4 per cent of the total
population) of whom about 40 per cent were born in Britain. Most of them share
aspirations that are broadly similar to those of the British community as a whole
and they enjoy full political and civic rights. Although the circumstances of
many members of the ethnic minority communities are less fortunate than
those of other groups (for example, they suffer disproportionately from
unemployment and often live in poor housing in the older urban areas) and
while they may experience racial discrimination there have been important
advances over the last 25 years in employment and housing conditions, and
many individuals have achieved distinction in their careers and in public life.
The growth of Asian businesses has been a particularly noticeable development
and there are numerous examples of enterprise among minorities to organise
self-help.
The difficulties minorities face are being tackled by environmental and
employment programmes in the inner cities, some of which benefit the whole
community, while other projects, for example, in education and health, are
directed towards meeting minorities’ special needs. Although fewer children
than formerly go to school with no knowledge of English, there are still many
who have an insufficient grasp of the language. Language teaching is recognised
to be of prime importance and various arrangements have been made for
teaching English as a second language. For adults, classes at or outside their
place of work are run by local authorities and voluntary organisations.
Government grants are available to authorities with substantial ethnic minority
groups towards the salaries of extra staff such as teachers, health visitors and
interpreters.

the local community are promoted by community relations councils and other
voluntary bodies. In recognition of the tensions that can arise between the police
and ethnic minorities, consultation between the police and the community has
been made a statutory requirement and consultative committees have been set
up in many areas. Policies for promoting equality of opportunity in a multiracial
society in which all citizens receive equal respect are pursued against a
background of legislation against discrimination.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment, training and related matters, in
education, in housing and in advertising. It strengthened legislation passed in
1968 which, in turn, widened the scope of the first race relations legislation
enacted in 1965. It also strengthened the criminal law on incitement to racial
hatred which will be tightened up further by the Public Order Bill at present
before Parliament.
The 1976 Act brought the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see p 27), and gave complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
The Commission for Racial Equality was established by the Race Relations Act
1976 with statutory duties to work towards the elimination of discrimination
and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of
different racial groups. It has power to investigate unlawful discriminatory
practices and to issue non-discrimination notices, requiring that such practices
should cease. It has an important educational role and has issued a code of
practice in employment. It is also the principal source of advice for the general
public about the Race Relations Act and has discretion to assist individuals with
their complaints.
The Commission supports the work of the 100 or so community relations
councils, which are autonomous, voluntaiy bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to promote harmonious community
re ations at the local level. It makes grants towards the salaries of the community
relations officers employed by the councils, most of whom also receive funds
from their local authorities, and gives grants to ethnic minority self-help groups
and to other projects run by or for the benefit of the minority communities.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of
full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer because of voluntary overtime. A large majority of
employees work a five-day week. & j j
The most common leisure activities are home based, or social, with visiting or
entertaining relatives or friends and watching television among the most
popular. Watching television is the main evening pastime for all except young
men. Nearly all households have a television set and the population aged five and
over spend on average some 20 hours a week watching programmes. Growing
numbers are using video recorders to watch programmes at times other than
their transmission; 21 per cent of households had a video recorder in 1984.
Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio, records or cassettes;
reading; do-it-yourself home improvements such as house painting and
decorating; going out for a meal or for a drink or to the cinema or to watch a
sporting event; gardening; outings (such as visits to the countryside, seaside or
o museums); photography; visits to social clubs and leisure centres; and social
and voluntary work. About half the households in Britain have a pet, the most
30
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
common being dogs (of which there are thought to be about 6 million in Britain)
and cats (over 5 million).
Sports and other pastimes have grown in popularity, reflected by increasing
membership of the main organisations concerned with outdoor activities,
although for some sports, such as football, the number of spectators has been
declining. Walking is the most popular sporting activity and is equally
undertaken by men and women. Billiards/snooker and darts are the next most
popular sports among men, followed by swimming and football, while swimming
is the second most popular sporting activity for women, although an increasing
number of women are participating in aerobics (keep-fit exercises) and yoga.
Holiday entitlements have increased for most full-time employees, and by the
end of 1984 some 95 per cent of manual workers had a basic holiday entitlement
of four weeks or more and 19 per cent five weeks or more. The number of
holidays (of four or more nights) taken by British residents was 48-75 million in
1985 compared with 48 million in 1975; 15-75 million of these were taken
abroad, well over half involving ‘package’ arrangements. More than four-fifths of
overseas holidays were taken in other European countries, with Spain being the
most popular destination; it received almost one-third of all British holiday¬
makers abroad. The next most popular destinations were France, Greece, Italy,
the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria. The main holiday period is May to
September when over 80 per cent of holidays in Britain and almost 70 per cent of
holidays abroad are taken. An increasing number of people (20 per cent in 1985)
take more than one long holiday each year, but a significant proportion take no
holiday away from home.
2 Government
The United Kingdom constitution, unlike that of most other countries, is not
contained in any single document. Formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by convention, it can be altered by Act of Parliament, or by general
agreement to create, vary or abolish a convention. The constitution thus adapts
readily to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are clearly distinguishable although their functions
often intermingle and overlap. The legislature, Parliament, is the supreme
authority. The executive consists of: (1) the Government—Cabinet and other
ministers who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(2) government departments, which are responsible for national administration;
(3) local authorities, which administer and manage many local services; and
(4) public corporations responsible for operating particular nationalised indus¬
tries or, for example, a social or cultural service, subject to ministerial control in
varying degrees. The judiciary determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both legislature and executive.
The Monarchy
The British people look to the Queen not only as their head of State, but also as
t e symbol of their nation’s unity. The monarchy is the most ancient secular
institution in the United Kingdom. During the last thousand years its
continuity has only once been broken (by the establishment of a republic which
lasted from 1649 to 1660) and, despite interruptions in the direct line of
succession, the hereditary principle upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. The royal title in the United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the
Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of
Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender
of the Faith . The form of the royal title is varied for those other member states of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of State,1 to suit the particular
circumstances of each. Other member states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the
other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of
tate, her representative is the Governor-General appointed by her on the advice
tt ^ 1™nisters of the country concerned and completely independent of the
United Kingdom Government.
In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by
governors, who are responsible to the British Government for the good
government of the countries concerned.
Succession,
Accession and
Coronation
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common law
rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of a granddaughter of James I of
ngland and VI of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of Hanover) are alone
e igible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its

present line, it can be altered only by common consent of the member nations of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
The sons of the Sovereign have precedence over the daughters in succeeding
to the throne. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and the
powers of the Crown are vested in her as though she were a king. While the
consort of a king takes her husband's rank and style, the constitution does not
give any special rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen-Regnant although
in practice he fills an important role in the life of the nation, as does the Duke of
Edinburgh.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon as his or her predecessor dies
and there is no interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed at an Accession
Council to which all members of the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords
Spiritual and Temporal (see p 36), the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London are also invited.
The Sovereign s coronation follows the accession after a convenient interval. It
is a ceremony which has remained essentially the same for over a thousand
years, even if details have often been modified to conform to the customs of the
time. It takes place at Westminster Abbey in London in the presence of
representatives of the Houses of Parliament and of all the great public interests
of the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations, and of representatives of other countries.
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is head of the executive, an integral
part of the legislature, head of the judiciary, the commander-in-chief of all armed
forces of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the established Church of
England. As a result of a long process of evolution, during which the monarchy’s
absolute power has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of
her ministers, which she cannot ignore. The United Kingdom is governed by Her
Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred years
towards assigning powers directly to ministers, there are still important acts of
government which require the participation of the Queen. These include
summoning, proroguing (discontinuing until the next session without disso¬
lution) and dissolving Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by
Parliament; appointing many important office holders, including government
ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats and
bishops and some other senior clergy of the Church of England; conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours1; and remitting all or part of the
penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. An important function is
appointing the Prime Minister and by convention the Queen invites the leader of
the political party which commands a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. In international affairs, the Queen as head of State has the power
to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign states and governments, to
conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (as when appointing the Prime Minister), those acts
involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowadays performed by
government ministers who are responsible to Parliament and can be questioned
about a particular policy. It is not necessary to have Parliament’s authority to
exercise these powers, although Parliament has the power to restrict or abolish a
prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility in no way detracts from the importance of the
Queen s role in the smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, a few
are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle the
Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other officials at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
numerous state papers; she must be informed and consulted on every aspect of
national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to perform them should the Queen be
totally incapacitated. The regent would be the Queen's eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the
Queen’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, there is provision for appointing
Counsellors of State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in line of
succession, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Queen may delegate certain
royal functions. However, Counsellors of State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the Queen’s express instructions), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and, in
spite of the change in the outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, many
traditional customs and ceremonies are retained. Royal marriages and royal
funerals are marked by public ceremony, and the Sovereign's birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits
Britain; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as a State opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives from Buckingham Palace to Westminster. Each year the Queen
and other members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom.
Their presence at scientific, artistic, industrial and charitable events of national
and local importance encourages nationwide interest and publicity. The Queen
pays state visits to foreign governments, accompanied by the Duke of
Edinburgh. She also undertakes lengthy tours in the other countries of the
Commonwealth. Other members of the royal family pay official visits overseas,
occasionally representing the Queen, and often in connection with an organisa¬
tion or a cause with which they are associated.
About 85 per cent of all expenditure arising from the royal family’s official duties
is met by public departments. This includes the costs of the royal yacht, the
Queen’s Flight, travel by train and the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from
this the Queen’s public expenditure on staff and expenses incurred in carrying
out official duties as head of State is financed from the Civil List, approved by
Parliament. (In 1986 this was £41 million.) Her private expenditure as
Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly from the
revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster1; and her personal expenditure as a private
individual from her own personal resources. There are annual allowances
approved by Parliament to other members of the royal family, though not to the
Prince of Wales, who as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the
estate of the Duchy of Cornwall (he voluntarily surrenders a quarter of the
revenue to the Exchequer). The Queen pays into the Exchequer a sum
equivalent to that provided by Parliament in respect of certain members of the
royal family.
Parliament
Parliament is the supreme legislative authority. Its three elements, the Queen,
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, are outwardly separate.
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed by the
reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy.

are constituted on different principles, and meet together only on occasions of
symbolic significance such as the State opening of Parliament when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
body, however. Parliament usually requires the concurrence of all its parts.
Parliament can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, for any of the
constituent parts of the country separately, or for any combination of them. It
can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are Crown
dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, having subordinate
legislatures which make laws on island affairs.1
Free from any legal restraints imposed by a written constitution. Parliament is
able to legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however. Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way Its
members bear in mind the common law and have tended to act in accordance
with precedent and tradition. The validity of an Act of Parliament which has
been duly passed, promulgated and published cannot be disputed in the law
courts, but no Parliament would be likely to pass an Act which it knew would
receive no public support. The system of party government helps to ensure that
Parliament legislates with its responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises the
various types of Community legislation, and sends 81 elected members to the
European Parliament.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws, (2) to provide, by voting
taxation, the means of cariying on the work of government, (3) to scrutinise
government policy and administration, particularly proposals for expenditure,
and (4) to debate the great political issues of the day. In discharging these
functions Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the
electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all
important international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being,
m theory at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government
and not subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five years, but is often dissolved and a
general election held before the end of this term. The maximum life has been
prolonged by legislation in such rare circumstances as the two world wars.
Dissolution and writs for a general election are ordered by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with adjournments' at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late (English) Spring Bank Holiday and during a long summer recess
starting in late July or early August. The average number of‘sitting’ days in a
session is about 175 in the House of Commons and about 150 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
overnment s broad policies and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is terminated by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued’ until the new
IslelllMfnfthpT °f ^ih nhannel Islandsf(the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and the
s the dutv S°Ur ) Consist °f the 9ueen, the Privy Council and the local assemblies. It
is the duty of the Home Secretaiy, as the Privy Council member primarily concerned with island
affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
36
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The House of
Lords
session opens (on occasions Parliament has been dissolved without proro¬
gation). A short speech is made on behalf of the Queen summarising
Parliament’s work during the past session. An adjournment does not affect
uncompleted business, but prorogation terminates nearly all parliamentary
business, so that all public Bills not completed lapse, and must be reintroduced
in the next session unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal consist of (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages, (2) all life peers and peeresses, and (3) those
Lords of Appeal (‘law lords') created life peers to assist the House in its judicial
duties. Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in the House (subject to certain
disqualifications), provided the holder establishes his or her claim and is 21
years of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months
of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose
their right to sit in the House but gain the right to vote at parliamentary
elections and to offer themselves for election to the House of Commons.
Temporal peerages, both hereditary and life, are conferred on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted either in recognition of service in
politics or other walks of life or because the Government of the day wishes to
have the recipient in the House of Lords. The House also provides a place in
Parliament for men and women whose advice is useful to the State, but who do
not wish to be involved in party politics.
In mid-1986 there were 1,175 members of the House of Lords, including the
two archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords Temporal consisted of 761
hereditary peers who had succeeded to their titles, 29 hereditary peers who have
had their titles conferred on them (including the Prince of Wales), and 359 life
peers, of whom 21 were ‘law lords’. Of the total, 92 peers were not in receipt of a
writ of summons and 136 peers were on leave of absence from the House (see
below). Of the 114 Irish peers 47 were entitled to sit in the House of Lords
because they were holders of an English, Scottish or United Kingdom peerage.
Other Irish peerages which pre-date the union of Great Britain and Ireland in
1800 do not entitle their holders to membership of the House of Lords.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings. Peers
who frequently attend the House (the average daily attendance is about 320)
include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in public service.
They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but can recover expenses
incurred in attending the House and certain travelling expenses (for which there
are maximum daily rates).
The House is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack1 2 as ex-officio Speaker of the House. In his absence his place may be
taken by a deputy speaker, a deputy chairman or, if neither is present, by a
speaker chosen by the Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord
Chairman of Committees, who is appointed at the beginning of each session and
takes the chair in all committees, unless the House decides otherwise. The Lord
1 Some hereditary peers do not establish their claim to succeed and so do not receive a writ of
summons entitling them to sit in the House. Lords may apply for leave of absence for the
duration, or for the remainder, of a Parliament.

Commonwealth countries; it is a relic from the medieval period when wool was the greatest source
of the country's wealth.

Chairman and the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees are salaried
officers of the House.
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings, including judgments, and for the
promulgation of Acts of Parliament, and who is also the accounting officer for
money voted to the House; the other Clerks at the Table who, with the Clerk of
the Parliaments and the other officers and officials of the House, are collectively
known as the Parliament Office; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is
also Serjeant at Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor and is responsible
for security and for accommodation and services in the House of Lords’ part of
the Palace of Westminster; and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Serjeant at
Arms and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of
Commons
Parliamentary
Electoral
System
The House of Commons is elected by universal adult suffrage and consists of 650
Members of Parliament (MPs). At present 27 are women. Of the 650 seats, 523
are for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies or resigns1 or is given a peerage, a
by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary of £18,500 (from
January 1987) and an allowance of £20,140 for secretarial and research
expenses. They also have a number of other allowances, including travel
allowances, a supplement for London members and, for provincial members
subsistence allowances and allowances for second homes. (For ministers’
salaries, see p 49.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, elected by MPs to
preside over the House. Other officers are the Chairman of Ways and Means and
two deputy chairmen who act as Deputy Speakers, elected by the House on the
nomination of the Government. They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity. The House is administered by a Commission
chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs) include the Clerk of the House of
Commons, who is the principal adviser to the Speaker of the House on its
privileges and procedures; his department has responsibilities relating to the
conduct of the business of the House and its many committees. The Clerk is also
accounting officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms, who waits upon the
Speaker, carries out certain orders of the House, is the official housekeeper of
the Commons part of the building, and is responsible for its security. Other
officers serve the House in the Libraiy, the Department of the Official Report
{Hansard), the Administration Department and the Refreshment Department.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
ol which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure equitable
representation four permanent Boundary Commissions, one each for England
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, make periodic reviews of constituencies
and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem necessary in the light
of population movements or other changes. Their last recommendations were
submitted to Parliament in 1982-83 and formed the basis for the constituencies
in the 1983 general election.
Elections are by secret ballot. British citizens and citizens of other Common¬
wealth countries, together with citizens of the Irish Republic, may vote provided
An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so only by using the technical device of

they are aged 18 or over, resident in the United Kingdom, registered in the
annual register of electors for the constituency and not subject to any
disqualification. People not entitled to vote include members of the House of
Lords, patients detained under mental health legislation, sentenced prisoners
and people convicted within the previous five years of corrupt or illegal election
practices. Service voters (members of the armed forces and their spouses, Crown
servants and staff of the British Council employed overseas, together with their
wives or husbands if accompanying them) may be registered for an address in a
constituency where they would live but for their service.
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a polling station. Service
voters resident abroad and merchant seamen may vote by proxy or, if in the
United Kingdom at the time of the election, by post. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person because of the nature of their work are
also entitled to vote by post. The Representation of the People Act 1985 extends
(from February 1987) the franchise to British citizens abroad for a period of five
years after leaving the United Kingdom and extends the right to apply for an
absent vote to all those who, including holidaymakers, cannot reasonably be
expected to vote in person at the polling station.
Voting is not compulsory; nearly 73 per cent of a total electorate of some 42
million people voted in the general election of June 1983. The candidate who
polls the most votes in a constituency is elected.
British citizens and citizens of other Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand and be elected as MPs provided they are
aged 21 or over and are not subject to any disqualification. Those disqualified
include undischarged bankrupts; people sentenced to more than one years
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers; and holders of certain offices listed
in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975. The latter include holders
of judicial office, civil servants, some local government officers, members of the
regular armed forces, or the police service, some members of public corporations
and government commissions, and in addition British members of the
legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth. A candidate s
nomination for election must be signed by two electors as proposer and
seconder, and by eight other electors registered in the constituency. He or she
does not require any party backing. A candidate must also deposit £500, which
is forfeited if his or her votes do not exceed 5 per cent of those validly cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend on an election campaign is £3,240
plus 2-8 pence for each elector in a borough constituency or 3-7 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. A candidate may post an election address to
each elector in the constituency, free of charge. All election expenses, apart from
the candidate’s personal expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the eighteenth century,
is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system relies heavily upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying policies before the electorate for approval. The parties are
not registered or formally recognised in law, but in practice most candidates in
elections, and almost all winning candidates, belong to one of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-party system has operated, and
since 1945 either the Conservative Party, which can trace its origins to the
eighteenth century, or the Labour Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
nineteenth century, has held power. The Liberal Party, which last formed a
government on its own in 1906—16, can also trace its origins to the eighteenth
century, while the Social Democratic Party was formed in 1981 and made an
alliance with the Liberal Party in the same year. Other parties include two
GOVERNMENT
39
nationalist parties, Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the Scottish
National Party (founded in 1934). In Northern Ireland there are a number of
parties; the largest of those represented in the House of Commons are the Ulster
Unionist Party, which was formed in the early part of this century, and the
Democratic Unionist Party, founded in 1971 by a group which broke away from
the Ulster Unionists.
The percentages of votes cast for the main political parties in the general
election of June 1983 and the resulting distribution of seats in the House of
Commons are given in Table 3.

The party which wins most seats (although not necessarily the most votes) at a
general election, or which has the support of a majority of members in the House
of Commons, usually forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of the
majority party is asked by the Sovereign to form a government; and about 100 of
its members in the House of Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including appointment to the Cabinet—see p 49) on
the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official
Opposition with its own leader and ‘shadow cabinet'.
Leaders of the Government and Opposition sit on the front benches of the
Commons with their supporters (the back-benchers) sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also apply to the House of Lords; however!
Lords who do not wish to be associated with either the Government or the
Opposition may sit on the ‘cross-benches'. The effectiveness of the party system
in Parliament rests largely on the relationship between the Government and the
40
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Procedure
opposition parties. Depending on the relative voting strengths of the parties in
the House of Commons, the Opposition might seek to overthrow the Govern¬
ment by securing its defeat on a ‘matter of confidence . In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; to oppose government proposals that it considers
objectionable; to secure concessions on government Bills; and to increase public
support and enhance its chances of electoral success.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses, by the Chief
Government Whips in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips. The Chief
Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to when the
question of finding time for debating some particular issue is discussed. The
Leaders of the two Houses are primarily responsible for the direction of business
and for providing facilities for the Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the party’s
voting strength by ensuring that members attend important debates, and
conveying to the party leadership the opinions of back-bench members. The
importance a party attaches to a vote on a particular issue is indicated to the
MPs by the underlining (once, twice or three times) on the notice sent to them,
failure to comply with a ‘three-line whip’ is usually seen as rebellion against the
party’s policy. Party discipline tends to be less strong in the Lords than in the
Commons.
The Chief Government Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury; of the other Government Whips, three (one of whom is Deputy
Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household, five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are Assistant Whips. Salaries are also
paid to the Chief Opposition Whips in both Houses and to two of the Opposition
Assistant Whips in the Commons. The Government Whips in the Lords hold
offices in the Royal Household and act as government spokesmen.
Annual assistance from public funds helps opposition parties to carry out
their parliamentary work at Westminster. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the previous general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount is: £1,500 for every seat won
plus £3 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £450,000. Since 1945 there
have been six Conservative and six Labour Governments and the great majority
of members of the House of Commons have represented either the Conservative
or the Labour Party.
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and precedent, partly formulated
in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The system of
debate is much the same in the two Houses; the subject originates in the form of
a motion (a proposal made by a member in order to elicit a decision from the
House). When a motion has been moved, the Speaker proposes the question as
the subject of debate. At the end of each debate the question may be agreed to
without voting, or else is decided by a vote on a simple majority. The main
difference between the two Houses is that in the Lords the office of Speaker
carries with it no authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being
decided by the general sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders
of the House. The Speaker of the Commons must guard against abuse of
procedure or infringement of minority rights; has discretion to allow or disallow

a closure motion (to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote);
and has powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save time in
other respects. In cases of grave disorder the House can be adjourned or the
sitting suspended by the Speaker. Voting in the Commons is under the direction
of the Speaker, whose duty it is to pronounce the final result. In the event of a
tied vote the Speaker gives the casting vote, but only in accordance with
established conventions which preclude an expression of opinion on the merits
of the question.
The voting procedure in the House of Lords is similar to that in the Commons,
except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting, vote. Bills
and subordinate legislation are in general allowed to proceed in the form before
the House unless a majority votes to reject or amend them; on other motions the
question is decided in the negative unless there is a majority in favour. When the
House is sitting judicially (the Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) the
judgment under appeal is not changed if the votes are equal.
The Commons has a public register of MPs’ financial interests. Members with
a relevant pecuniary interest in a matter before the House, direct or indirect,
must declare it when taking part in a debate, though to act as a disqualification
from voting the interest must be direct, immediate and personal. In any other
proceedings of the House or in transactions with other members or with
ministers or civil servants, MPs must also disclose any relevant financial interest
or benefit.
Proceedings of both Houses are public, except on extremely rare occasions; the
minutes (in the Commons called Votes and Proceedings and in the Lords,
Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of Parliamentary
Debates, Hansard) are published daily. The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with the parliamentary and political
papers of certain past members of the Houses, are available to the public on
application to the House of Lords Record Office. Parliament is not normally
televised, but proceedings are recorded and sound transmissions of some are
made on television and radio, either live or recorded. A Parliamentary Sound
Archive has been established. Debates on televising proceedings have taken
place on several occasions and, most recently, in November 1985 the House of
Commons voted against televising its proceedings. A televised broadcasting
experiment of proceedings in the Lords began in early 1985 and in May 1986 the
House authorised the televising to continue.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles are
interpreted, clarified or reapplied to meet new circumstances, but substantial
changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
A draft law takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public Bills
involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private Bills
which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest. Hybrid
Bills are public Bills which may in certain respects affect private rights, and
their passage through Parliament is governed by a special procedure which
allows those affected to make representations. Public Bills can be introduced, in
either House, by a government minister or by a private’ member. Most public
Bills that become law are in practice sponsored by the Government.
Before a government Bill is finally drafted, there is normally considerable
consultation with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other
agencies interested in the subject matter, such as major interest and pressure
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative changes
are sometimes set out in government ‘White Papers’ which may be debated in
42
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. From time to time consultative
documents, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out for public discussion
government proposals which are still at a formative stage.
Bills must be passed by each House. As a rule government Bills likely to raise
political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords, while those of
an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass through the Lords first.
(Consolidation Bills are always introduced in the House of Lords.) A Bill with a
mainly financial purpose is nearly always introduced in the Commons, and a Bill
involving taxation must be based on resolutions agreed by that House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a
public charge, it can only be introduced by a minister or, if brought from the
Lords, be proceeded with in the Commons if taken up by a minister, an
arrangement which gives the Government considerable control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot for
precedence in introducing a Bill on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. After the ballot a private member may also present a Bill
after question time (see p 45), or seek to introduce a Bill under the ‘ten minute
rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one against the measure,
after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill to be brought in. Private
members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a few become law each session.
If one secures a second reading, the Government usually introduces any
necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be introduced in the
House of Lords at any time, but the time that can be given to them in the
Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses. The Bill receives
a formal first reading on introduction, is printed, and after a while (between one
day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) is given a second
reading after a debate on its general principles and merits. In the Commons a
non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second reading committee to decide
whether it should be read a second time. After a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill is usually referred for detailed examination to a standing
committee (see p 43). If the House so decides, the Bill may be referred to the
whole House sitting in committee. The committee stage is followed by the report
stage, during which further amendments may be considered. At the third
reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form and may again be debated. The House
may vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. After the third reading a
Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes through broadly the same
stages. In the Lords, after the second reading, a Bill is considered by a committee
of the whole House unless the House takes the rare decision to refer it to a Public
Bill Committee. It is then considered on report and read a third time; at all these
stages amendments may be made. A Bill which starts in the Lords and is passed
by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there. Amendments
made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature. How¬
ever, if a non-governmental Lords Bill were unacceptable to the Commons it
would generally not become law since no debating time would be allotted to it.
The Lords, on the other hand, do not in general prevent a Bill insisted upon by
the Commons from finally becoming law. Normally they either accept the Bill
without changes, or amend and return it for consideration by the Commons,
who frequently agree to the amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass
without amendment Bills authorising taxation or national expenditure. A Bill
that deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month

of being sent to the Lords, whether or not they agree to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached between the two Houses on a
non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can in practice
delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the end of this
time it may, in accordance with the Parliament Acts, be submitted to the Queen
for royal assent, provided it has again been passed by the Commons. A Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament would require the full assent of both Houses in
the normal way.
The limitations on the power of the Lords, contained in the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949, are based on the belief that the principal legislative function of
the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a chamber of revision, com¬
plementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known as
an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, promoted by people or organisations outside Parliament (often
local authorities) to give them special powers not granted by the general law,
go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but most of the
work is done in committee, where procedures follow a semi-judicial pattern:
the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges sought and
the objections of opposing interests are heard. Both sides may be legally
represented.
Delegated legislation, used to relieve pressure on parliamentary time, gives
ministers and other authorities the power to regulate administrative details
after a law has been passed. To minimise the risk that powers thus conferred on
the executive might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, they are
normally delegated to authorities directly responsible to Parliament. Moreover,
the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in
carrying out these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right to
affirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations affected before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of these
‘statutory instruments’. In order to save time on the floor of the House, where
statutory instruments may be considered, the Commons also uses standing
committees to consider the merits of instruments, with any decisions reserved
to the House.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee (of the whole House) to consider
Bills in detail after their second reading. A committee of the whole House is
presided over by the Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees
in the House of Lords) or a deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on, and are each
appointed specially to consider a specific Bill. Each has between 16 and 50
members with a party balance reflecting as far as possible that in the House as a
whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish
members and 10 to 15 others (and may be convened in Edinburgh), considers
the principles of Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish

estimates and other matters concerning Scotland only. The Welsh Grand
Committee, with all 38 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills
referred to it at second reading stage, and matters concerning Wales only. The
Northern Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to Northern
Ireland. A standing committee on regional affairs attended by any of the 523
members from the English constituencies is occasionally appointed to consider
matters relating to the English regions. The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely used.
In 1979 a new House of Commons select committee structure was set up in an
attempt to provide closer examination of government departments and policies,
and of the way ministers discharge their responsibilities.
This was in response to a recognition that Parliament was probably less
effective a check on the executive than it had been for much of the nineteenth
century. With the growth of mass political parties, the individual independence
of many MPs has tended to become subordinated to party interests, and with the
great extension of the range and complexity of central government activities,
and the parallel growth of bureaucracy, MPs have a more difficult task in
checking the actions of ministers and their departments.
The 14 committees examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the
main government departments and related bodies. The Foreign Affairs Com¬
mittee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, and there are select committees on Scottish and Welsh Affairs. The
committees are constituted on a party basis, in approximate proportions to
party strength in the House. Other regular committees include those on
European Legislation, Defence, Public Accounts, Members’ Interests, the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and Sound Broadcasting. The
Committee of Selection and the Standing Orders Committee have duties relating
to private Bills, and the Committee of Selection also chooses members to serve
on standing and select committees. A Liaison Committee considers general
matters relating to select committees. On rare occasions a parliamentary Bill is
examined by a select committee, a procedure additional to the usual legislative
process—(an example of this which occurs every few years is the Armed Forces
Bill).
In their scrutiny of government policies, the committees question ministers,
senior civil servants and interested bodies and individuals. Through hearings
and published reports, they bring before Parliament and the public a body of fact
and informed opinion on many important issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal and Appellate Committees in which
the bulk of the House’s judicial work is transacted, there are two major select
committees with several sub-committees on the European Communities and on
Science and Technology. There are also select committees on House of Lords’
Offices, Hybrid Instruments, Leave of Absence and Lords' Expenses, Personal
Bills, Private Bills, Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure, Selection and Sound
Broadcasting and Television.
Joint committees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation
Bills and delegated legislation. The two Houses may also agree to set up joint
select committees on other subjects.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
unofficial party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members’ Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of the back-bench mem¬
bership of the party in the House of Commons. When the Conservative Party is
GOVERNMENT
45
in office, ministers attend its meetings by invitation and not by right, but when
the party is in opposition, the whole membership of the party may attend
meetings and the leader appoints a consultative committee which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet'. The Parliamentary Labour Party is a corporate body
comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when the Labour Party is in
office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communication between the
Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when the party is in
opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under the direction of
an elected Parliamentary Committee which acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of
Parliamentary
Control
1. Question time when for an hour on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs' questions. The Prime Minister’s question
time takes place on Tuesday and Thursday. Parliamentary questions are one
means of eliciting information about the Government’s intentions, as well as a
way of airing, and possibly securing redress of, grievances brought to MPs’
notice by constituents. MPs may also put questions to ministers for written
answers, which are published in Hansard, the official report. (At question
time in the House of Lords questions are addressed to the Government rather
than to a particular minister.)
2. The right of MPs to use motions for the adjournment of the House to open
discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end of the business of the day; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and summer), a full day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, an MP wishing to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, the MP asks the House for leave for the motion to be
put forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or it can be given if 40 or more
MPs support the motion or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is
debated for three hours, usually on the next day.
3. The 19 Opposition days each session when the Opposition can choose
subjects for debate.
4. Debates on the occasion of the passage, three times a year, of Consolidated
Fund or Appropriation Bills, when members can exercise their traditional
right of‘raising grievances’, on matters for which any minister is responsible,
when voting the necessary supplies (money) for the Crown.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during the
debate on the Queen's speech at the beginning of a session, during debates or
motions of censure for which the Government gives up part of its own time, and
during debates on the Government’s legislative proposals.
The effectiveness of parliamentary control of the Government is a subject of
continuing discussion, both inside and outside Parliament. Control is exercised
finally by the ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence or, ultimately, by refusing to vote the money required for the public
service. In addition to the system of close scrutiny by select committees, the
House of Commons offers a number of opportunities for a searching examin¬
ation of government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own
back-benchers.
These include:

Parliamentary
Privilege
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Opportunities for criticism and examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily question time, during debates on specific
motions and in questions (which can be debated) at the end of the day’s
business as well as during debates on specific legislative proposals.
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and more particularly of the House of
Commons, in managing the revenue of the State and payments for the public
service are to authorise the taxes and duties to be levied and the various objects
of expenditure and the sum to be spent on each. It also has to satisfy itself that
the sums granted are spent only for the purposes which Parliament intended. No
payment out of the central Government’s public funds can be made and no
taxation, charges or loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament, although
interim payments can be made, within limits, from the Contingencies Fund.
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out by House of Commons Select
Committees (see p 44). <
To keep the two Houses informed of European Community developments, and
to enable them to scrutinise and debate Community policies and proposals,
there is a select committee in each House (see p 44), and ministers make regular
statements about Community business.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) investigates, independently, complaints of maladministration
when asked to do so by MPs on behalf of members of the public. Powers of
investigation extend to administrative actions by central government depart¬
ments but not to policy decisions (which can be questioned in Parliament) nor to
matters affecting relations with other countries. Complaints by British citizens
arising from dealings with British posts overseas are open to investigation in
some circumstances. The Commissioner has access to departmental papers and
reports the findings to the MP who presented the complaint. The Commissioner
is required to report annually to Parliament. In addition, he or she publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly intervals and may submit other
reports where necessary. A Commons select committee has responsibility for
overseeing the Commissioner’s work.
Each House of Parliament has certain rights and immunities to protect it from
unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. The rights apply collectively
to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims ‘their ancient and undoubted
rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in civil actions; exemption from serving
on juries, attending as witnesses or serving as sheriffs; and the right of access to
the Crown, a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges include the
rights of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance,
to exclude ‘strangers’ if it wishes), to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to penalise for
breach of its privileges and for contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords closely resemble those of the House of
Commons.
The Privy Council
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was the
chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent. Many
powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner committee of the Council,
and much of its work was handed over to newly created government depart¬
ments, some of which were originally committees of the Privy Council.
GOVERNMENT
47
Committees of
the Privy
Council
Composition
Prime Minister
Nowadays the main function of the Privy Council is to advise the Queen to
approve Orders in Council (those made under prerogative powers, such as
Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorporation; and those made
under statutory powers). Members of the Privy Council attending meetings at
which Orders are made do not thereby become personally responsible for the
policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests with the minister responsible
for the subject matter of the Order in question, whether or not he or she was
present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament). The Council’s own statutory responsi¬
bilities, which are independent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council,
include powers of supervision over the registering bodies for the medical and
allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn
in on first assuming office, membership of the Council (retained for life except
for very occasional removals) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommenda¬
tion of the Prime Minister to eminent people in independent monarchical
countries of the Commonwealth. There are about 390 Privy Counsellors. A full
Council is summoned only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign
announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of advisory Privy Council committees whose meetings differ
from those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot consti¬
tutionally be present. These may be prerogative committees, such as those
dealing with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man and with applications for charters of incorporation;
or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not discontinued the appeal, courts
of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other courts, some
professional and disciplinary committees and ecclesiastical sources.
Administrative work is carried out in the Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the Commons, although the
Government is also fully represented by ministers in the Lords. The Lord
Chancellor is always a member of the House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary both in the number of ministers and
in the titles of some offices. New ministerial offices may be created, others may
be abolished, and functions may be transferred from one minister to another.
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister
for the Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The Prime Minister’s unique position of
authority derives from majority support in Parliament and from the power to

choose ministers and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
modern convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister informs the Queen of the general business of the
Government, presides over the Cabinet, and is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include recommending to the
Queen a number of appointments. These include: Church of England
archbishops, bishops and deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown ‘livings’;
high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
and the Lords Justices of Appeal: Privy Counsellors, Lords-Lieutenant and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner to the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and
some university posts; and appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as various
royal and statutory commissions. Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions and of Civil List pensions (to
people who have achieved eminence in science and the arts and are in some
financial need). The Prime Minister also selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10 Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants who attend to the day-to-day
discharge of the Prime Minister’s numerous responsibilities. The Prime Minister
may also appoint special advisers to the Office from time to time to assist in the
formation of policies.
Ministers in charge of government departments, who are usually in the Cabinet,
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’, or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The holders of various traditional offices, namely the Lord President of the
Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the
Paymaster General and, from time to time, Ministers without Portfolio, may
have few or no departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give them. In the present Government the
Lord President of the Council, for example, co-ordinates the presentation of
information on government policies and the Paymaster General is Minister for
Employment in the Department of Employment.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a minister with departmen¬
tal functions and also head of the judiciary. The four Law Officers of the Crown
are: for England and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for
Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State usually work with ministers in charge of departments with
responsibility for specific functions, and are sometimes given titles which reflect
these particular functions. More than one may work in a department. A Minister
of State may be given a seat in the Cabinet and paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State or, where
the senior minister is not a Secretary of State, simply Parliamentary Secretaries)
share in parliamentary and departmental duties. They may also be given
responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific aspects of
the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and other
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips (see p 40).

The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range from £30,760 a year
(from January 1987) for junior ministers to £47,020 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £58,650 and the Lord Chancellor (from July 1986)
£79,400.1
Ministers in the Commons, including the Prime Minister, receive a parliamen¬
tary salary of £13,875 a year (which is included in the above figures) in
recognition of their constituency responsibilities and are entitled to claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs (see p 37).2
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers chosen by the Prime Minister
and may include departmental and non-departmental ministers. Its origins can
be traced back to the informal conferences which the Sovereign held with
leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth
century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the
eighteenth century, and the development of organised political parties stimu¬
lated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of policies, the
supreme control of government and the co-ordination of government depart¬
ments. The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the
Cabinet is a group of party representatives, depending upon majority support in
the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are confidential. Its members
are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose information about
its proceedings; although after Cabinet papers have been in existence for 30
years they may be made available for inspection in the Public Record Office.
Diaries published by several former ministers have given the public an insight
into Cabinet procedures in recent times.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less often when Parliament is not sitting. To
keep the amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a
great deal of work is carried on through the committee system, which involves
the reference of issues either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc
committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the
Cabinet with recommendations for action. The present Cabinet has four
standing committees: a defence and overseas policy committee and an economic
strategy committee both under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister; and a
home and social affairs committee and a legislation committee, both under the
chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council. Sub-committees of the
standing committees may be established. Membership and terms of reference of
all Cabinet committees are confidential.
Non-Cabinet ministers may be invited to attend meetings on matters affecting
their departments, and may be members of Cabinet committees. The Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior officials of the Cabinet Office also attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Statistical
Office, the Management and Personnel Office and the Historical Section.
1 These figures show the salaries to which the holders are entitled; however, the Prime Minister
and the Lord Chancellor of the present Government have decided to draw no more than the salary
payable to other Cabinet ministers.
2 The Leader of the Opposition in the Commons receives a salary for the post, as well as a
parliamentary salary; the Leader of the Opposition in the Lords also receives a salary.
50
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ministerial
Responsibility
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business and operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the
highest level.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and interpre¬
tation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies and
management, and co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments.
The Management and Personnel Office is responsible for the management and
organisation of the Civil Service and recruitment into it, training, efficiency,
personnel management and senior appointments.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing the
official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the preparation
of official histories of certain peacetime events.
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility which
ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers’ individual
responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility means that the Cabinet acts unani¬
mously even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree on a subject. The policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government as
a whole. Once the Government's policy on a matter has been decided, each
minister is expected to support it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on government policies involving
important issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his or her
department means that, as political head of that department, he or she is
answerable for all its acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any
defect of administration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy
which may be criticised in Parliament, whether personally responsible or not.
Since most ministers are members of the House of Commons, they must answer
questions and defend themselves against criticism in person. Departmental
ministers in the House of Lords are represented in the Commons by someone
qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they usually consult their
colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. A decision
by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
keeping government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies, and must order their affairs so that there is no conflict between
public duties and private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation, and
for advising ministers. They may, and frequently do, work with and through
local authorities, statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of government control.
A change of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by some organisational change.
GOVERNMENT
51
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (like the Department of
Employment) cover England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland.
Others, such as the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with
affairs in England.
Some departments, such as the Department of Trade and Industry, maintain
a regional organisation, and some which have direct contact with the public
throughout the country (for example, the Department of Employment) also have
local offices.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent official, and
a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For instance,
ministers in the Treasury are responsible for the Central Office of Information,
Her Majesty s Stationery Office, HM Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue
and a number of small departments including the Treasury Solicitor's Depart¬
ment, the Royal Mint, and the National Investment and Loans Office. Depart¬
ments generally receive their funds directly out of money provided by Parliament
and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Non-
Departmental
Public Bodies
A number of bodies with a role in the process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a department (in April 1985 the figure was
1,653). Known as non-departmental public bodies, but often popularly
described as quangos ( quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations',
although there is no precise definition of the term), they are of three kinds:
executive bodies, advisory bodies and tribunals. Executive bodies normally
employ staff and have their own budget; they consist of public bodies which
carry out, among other duties, administrative, executive, regulatory and
commercial functions. They operate typically within broad policy guidelines set
by departmental ministers but are in varying degrees independent of govern¬
ment in carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities. Examples include the Arts
Council of Great Britain, the British Council, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation and the Commission for Racial Equality. Tribunals are a special¬
ised group of judicial bodies which are akin to courts of law. They are normally
set up under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions
and procedure. Tribunals often consist of laymen, but generally have a legally
qualified chairman. They tend to be less expensive, and less formal, than courts
of law. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and
obligations of private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. Important examples are industrial
tribunals, rent tribunals and social security tribunals. Tribunals usually consist
of an uneven number of people so that a majority decision can be reached.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject.
Tribunals and advisory bodies do not normally employ staff or spend money
themselves, but their expenses are paid by government departments concerned:
a note on advisory bodies is set out below.
As a result of reviews of non-departmental public bodies undertaken in 1979
and subsequently, nearly 700 have been abolished or otherwise rationalised
with an annual saving of £100 million at 1984 prices. Scrutiny of these bodies
continues with a new programme to improve performance and value for money
announced at the end of 1984.
Advisory
Bodies
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
which undertake research and collect information, mainly to give ministers
access to informed opinion before coming to a decision involving a legislative or
52
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
executive act. In some cases a minister must consult a standing committee, but
usually advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according to
the nature of the work involved, and will usually include representatives of
varying interests and professions.
In addition to the standing advisory bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine and make recommendations on specific matters. For
certain important inquiries Royal Commissions, whose members are chosen for
their wide experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government departments,
interested organisations and individuals, and submit recommendations. The
Government may accept the recommendations in whole or in part, or may decide
to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be undertaken by
departmental committees. <
Each of the main government departments has its own information division or
directorate, public relations branch or news department staffed by professional
information officers responsible for communicating their department’s policies
and activities to the news media and the public (sometimes using publicity
services provided by the Central Office of Information—see p 53) and for
advising their department on the public’s reaction to them. The presentation of
government policy is co-ordinated, at official level, by the Prime Minister’s Press
Secretary. As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister's Press Office have direct and constant contact with
the parliamentary press through regular meetings with the Lobby correspon¬
dents (a group of political correspondents who have the special privilege of
access to the Lobby of the House of Commons where they can talk privately to
government ministers and other members of the House) and other day-to-day
contacts. The Prime Minister’s Press Office forms the accepted channel through
which information about parliamentary business is conveyed to the media.

Scotland has its own system of law and wide administrative autonomy. The
Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has responsibility in
Scotland (with some exceptions) for both formulating and carrying out policy
relating to agriculture and fisheries, education, law and order, local government
and environmental services, social work, health, housing, roads and certain
aspects of shipping and road transport services.
The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and development
of the Scottish economy, and important functions relating to industrial
development, with responsibility for financial assistance to industry, for the
Scottish Development Agency, and the Highlands and Islands Development
Board, the Scottish Tourist Board and for the work of the Manpower Services
Commission and the Careers Service. The Secretary of State plays a full part in
determining energy policy, particularly in relation to responsibility for the
electricity supply industry in Scotland. He is also responsible for the government
interest in a range of other functions from fire services to sport.
The distinctive features and the different conditions and needs of Scotland
and its people are reflected in separate Scottish legislation on many domestic
matters or else in special provisions applying to Scotland alone, inserted in Acts
which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Secretary of State discharges his responsibilities principally through the
Scottish Office’s five departments, supported by Central Services (see p 56) and
four smaller departments—the Department of the Registers of Scotland, the

minister responsible for functions previously exercised by the Northern Ireland
Government. Attempts have been made by successive governments to find a
means of restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland on a basis that
would command widespread acceptance throughout the community. The most
recent attempt failed in June 1986 when the Northern Ireland Assembly, elected
in 1982, was dissolved after it ceased to discharge its responsibilities of making
proposals for the resumption of devolved government and of monitoring the
work of the Northern Ireland departments. The Government expressed the hope
that a new Assembly would be established which would contribute to the better
government and administration of Northern Ireland.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is the Cabinet minister responsible
for Northern Ireland. Through the Northern Ireland Office he has direct
responsibility for constitutional developments, law and order and security, and
electoral matters. The work of the Northern Ireland departments, whose
functions are listed below, are also subject to the direction and control of the
Secretary of State.

Structure
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the conduct of the whole range of
government activities as they affect the community, ranging from policy
formulation to carrying out the day-to-day duties that public administration
demands.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown. They are responsible to the minister
in whose department they work for carrying out his or her policies. Ministers
alone are answerable to Parliament for their policies and the actions of their staff
(though civil servants may give evidence to parliamentary select committees on
their minister’s behalf). In the determination of policy the civil servant has no
constitutional responsibility or role distinct from that of the minister. A change
of minister, for whatever reason, does not involve a change of staff. (Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from outside the C(ivil Service; the advisers
are paid from public funds, but their appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or when the Minister to whom the special
adviser is appointed leaves the Government or moves to another appointment.)
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent
to one full-time), in January 1986 there were around 597,000 civil servants
(nearly half of them women), roughly half of whom were engaged in the provision
of public services, such as paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting
taxes and contributions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and
providing services to industry and agriculture. Just over a quarter were
employed in the Ministry of Defence. The rest were divided between: central
administrative and policy duties; service-wide support services, such as
accommodation, printing and information; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those provided by the Department for National
Savings and the Royal Mint.
The total number includes about 99,000 ‘industrial’ civil servants, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments.
Over three-quarters of civil servants work outside London. As part of its policy
of controlling the cost and size of the Civil Service and to improve its efficiency,
the Government set a target in 1980 of reducing the number of civil servants by
14 per cent to 630,000 by April 1984. This was achieved as was the target for
April 1985 (by when numbers had fallen to 599,000). It is planned to achieve a
further reduction to 590,000 by April 1988 at which date the Civil Service will
have been reduced by around one-fifth since 1979. At the same time reforms of
all aspects of the management of government departments are being im¬
plemented to ensure improved management performance, in particular through
the sharper accountability of individual managers based on clear objectives and
responsibilities. These reforms include an experimental performance-related
pay scheme, and other means to encourage and reward improved performance.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service and Civil Service Commission,
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain. Interchange of staff between the
two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only.
Responsibility for central co-ordination and management of the Civil Service is
divided between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office (Management and
Personnel Office). In addition to its other functions, the Treasury is responsible
for controlling Civil Service manpower, pay, pensions and allowances, while the
Management and Personnel Office, which is part of the Cabinet Office and under
the control of the Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, is responsible
for the organisation, structure, management and overall efficiency of the
Service. The function of official Head of the Home Civil Service is combined with
that of Secretary to the Cabinet. At the senior levels of the Home Civil Service
GOVERNMENT
59
The Diplomatic
Service
Recruitment
and Training
there is an open structure of unified grades which, with few exceptions, covers
all posts whatever the nature of their duties. Grades 1, 2 and 3 replace the
former grade titles of Permanent Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Under¬
secretary while Grades 4, 5, 6 and 7 cover the senior levels of most occupational
groups and classes down to Principal, Principal Scientific Officer, Principal
Professional and Technology Officer and equivalent levels.
Below this the structure of the non-industrial Civil Service is based on a
system of categories and occupational groups, which are the basic groupings of
staff for the purposes of recruitment, pay and personnel management. These
include the General Category (covering the Administration, Economist, Statis¬
tician, Information Officer and Librarian groups), the Science Category, the
Professional and Technology Category (including architects, surveyors, electri¬
cal and mechanical engineers, graphics officers and marine services staff), and
the Training, Legal, Police, Secretarial, Data Processing, Research Officer,
Social Security, Security and Museum Categories. These 12 categories account
for some 75 per cent of non-industrial staff. Work requiring specialist skill is
always done by appropriately qualified individuals.
Personnel management policies encourage the deployment of staff so that
talent can be used to the best advantage, and, with higher posts open to people
of outstanding ability (whatever their specialist background or original method
of entry into the Service), ensure that people with the necessary qualities can
gain suitably wide experience to fit them for posts at the highest levels. The
exchange of staff between the Civil Service and industry is also encouraged.
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of some 4,650 or so people, provides
the staff for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts abroad. Its functions include advising
on policy, negotiating with overseas governments and conducting business in
international organisations; promoting British exports and trade generally,
administering aid, presenting ideas, policies and objectives to the people of
overseas countries; and protecting British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service, and conditions of work are in many ways comparable
while taking into account the special demands of the Service, particularly of
postings overseas. Members of the Home Civil Service and the armed forces, and
individuals from the private sector, may serve in the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Recruitment of staff to the middle and higher levels of the Home Civil Service
and the Diplomatic Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission
which, in conjunction with departments, ensures that staff are selected solely on
merit through fair and open competition. The selection of junior staff, such as
those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken by the departments.
For the Administration Group, the central part of the Home and Diplomatic
Civil Services, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic
achievements of; a second class honours degree, or better; GCE Advanced level;
and GCE Ordinary level. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by tests
and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an interview by the Final
Selection Board. For the next level (the Executive Officer entry) selection involves
qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the lower level (the clerical entry)
selection is normally by interview of those holding the prescribed educational
qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.

Promotion and
Terms of
Service
Political and
Private
Activities
Most government departments employ full-time training officers and tutors to
help to identify staff training needs and to organise training by the most
appropriate methods (for example, formal courses or self-instruction). The Civil
Service College provides training most efficiently undertaken centrally. Use is
also made of external institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may continue their education by attending
courses usually for one day a week (‘day release' schemes). Adult staff may be
entitled to financial assistance to undertake, mainly in their own time, private
studies leading to recognised educational or professional qualifications in
approved subjects. There are also opportunities for civil servants to obtain
fellowships for research in areas of interest both to themselves and to their
departments.
Departments are responsible for promotion at all grade levels. Normally
promotion is from grade to grade, but there can be accelerated promotion for
staff who show exceptional promise. Promotion or appointment to Grades 1 and
2 and all transfers between departments at these levels are approved by the
Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head of the Home Civil Service.
Terms of service for civil servants are generally governed by agreements
between senior officials (the Official Side of the National Whitley Council) and
representatives of the employees (the Trade Union Side of the National Whitley
Council). For industrial civil servants, the negotiating body is the Joint
Co-ordinating Committee of government industrial establishments.
Civil servants are required to discharge loyally the duties assigned to them by
the Government of the day of whatever political persuasion. For the Civil Service
to serve successive governments of different political complexions it is essential
that ministers and the public should have confidence that civil servants’
personal views do not cut across the discharge of their official duties. The
purpose of the rules which govern political activities by civil servants is to allow
them the greatest possible freedom to participate in public affairs without
infringing these fundamental principles. The rules are concerned with political
activities liable to give public expression to political views, rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in political activities. The ‘politically
free’ group, consisting of industrial staff and non-office grades, are free to
engage in any political activity including adoption as a candidate for the United
Kingdom or the European Parliament (although they would have to resign from
the Service if elected). The ‘politically restricted’ group, which mainly comprises
Principal and equivalent grades and above, are debarred from national political
activities but may apply for permission to take part in local political activities.
The ‘intermediate’ group, which comprises all civil servants not in either of the
other two groups, may apply for permission to take part in national or local
political activity, apart from candidature for the United Kingdom or the
European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the
avoidance of any conflict with official duties. It is granted subject to a code of
discretion requiring moderation and the avoidance of embarrassment to
ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the private activities of civil servants,
provided that these do not bring discredit on the Civil Service, and that there is
no possibility of conflict with official duties. For instance, a civil servant is
required to seek permission before taking part in any outside activity which
GOVERNMENT
61
Security
Principal Types
of Local
Authority
involves the use of official experience, or before accepting a directorship in any
company holding a contract with his or her department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern. However, no one whose loyalty is in doubt may be employed on work
vital to the security of the State. For this reason certain posts are not open to
those who are known to be members of communist or fascist organisations or of
subversive groups, or associated with them in such a way as to raise legitimate
doubts about their reliability, or to anyone whose reliability may be in doubt for
any other reason.
Each department is responsible for its own internal security, advised as
necessary by the Security Service. The Security Commission, if requested to do
so by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition,
may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure.
Local Government
A wide range of public services is provided by democratically elected local
authorities throughout the United Kingdom. The gradual expansion of local
services, particularly in the period between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, has
inevitably led to a steady rise in local government expenditure and in its support
from central funds. In recent years central government has sought to check this
growth as part of a general policy of reducing public expenditure. Measures
introduced to promote greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness include the
holding back of central government grant from authorities spending above
government targets, the prescription of maximum levels of spending and rates
for selected high-spending authorities in England and Wales, the establishment
in England and Wales of the independent Audit Commission to audit accounts
and seek economical use of resources, and the encouragement given to local
authorities to examine the scope for seeking competitive tenders for the
provision of many of the services carried out by their own staff. In Scotland there
is an independent Commission for Local Authority Accounts and similar action
has been taken to control local authority expenditure. Moreover, since staff costs
form such a significant part of public expenditure, local authorities have been
urged to reduce staff levels. Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland are
now required to publish quarterly staffing levels for particular services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Parliament, or by measures made under its authority. The actual adminis¬
tration, and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are the responsi¬
bility of the local authority. In the case of certain services, however, ministers
have powers to secure a measure of national uniformity in the standard of a
service provided, to safeguard public health, or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. For some services the minister concerned has wide powers of
supervision; for others there are strictly limited powers.
The main links between local authorities and the central government are: in
England, the Department of the Environment, although other departments are
concerned with various local government functions; in Scotland, the Scottish
Office; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland, the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland.
England and Wales (outside Greater London) are divided into 53 counties,
within which there are 369 districts. All the districts and 47 of the counties—the
‘non-metropolitan' counties—have independent, locally elected councils with
separate functions. County authorities provide the large-scale local government
62
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Election of
Councils
services, while the district authorities are responsible for the more local ones
(see p 63).
In Greater London (an area of about 1,580 sq km (610 sq miles) and a
population of some 7 million) the local government authorities are the councils
of 32 London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of London, while in the
six metropolitan counties there are 36 district councils.
Until April 1986 Greater London and the metropolitan counties had their own
councils but these were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985, which was
designed to create a more effective, economical and accountable system by
removing a tier of local government. As a result most of the functions previously
carried out by the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils
have been transferred to the London borough and metropolitan district
councils. A small number of services (namely, waste regulation and disposal in
certain areas; the police and fire services, including civil defence, and public
transport in all metropolitan counties; and the fire service, including civil
defence, in London) which require a statutory authority over areas wider than
the boroughs and districts are now run by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or district councils. Education in inner
London is now the responsibility of a new, independent and directly elected
authority (see p 64).
Special transitional bodies have been appointed to take responsibility for
certain residual county council and Greater London Council matters. These
include compensation, unassigned legal rights and liabilities and disposal of
surplus property and, where appropriate, the management of debt and of the
superannuation fund. The residuary bodies are required to prepare proposals to
wind up their affairs as soon as practicable.
Within rural districts in England, parish councils or meetings are focuses for
local opinion as bodies with limited powers of local interest. In Wales community
councils have similar functions.
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is also made for local community councils, although
these are not local authorities.
The areas and electoral arrangements of local authorities are kept under
review by the Local Government Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are responsible for local environmen¬
tal and certain other services. Statutory bodies, such as the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive and area boards, are responsible to central government
departments for the administration of major services such as housing,
education and libraries, and health and personal social services. Regional
services such as roads, water and sewerage, and planning, are the responsibility
of central government, through the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. Councillors can claim a flat-rate attendance
allowance or a financial loss allowance for performing council business; they are
also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim expenses for duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority (in Northern Ireland by the
Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the chairman is normally known as
GOVERNMENT
63
the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor). In Scotland the chairman of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No specific title is laid down for
the chairmen of other councils, but some are known as conveners, while others
continue to use the old title of ‘provost’.
Elections for any form of local government normally take place every four
years. Hitherto metropolitan district elections have been held for a third of the
seats in each year when there were no county council elections. Non¬
metropolitan district councils may adopt the same procedure or opt for whole
council elections every four years. London borough councils have whole council
elections every four years.
In Scotland, local elections are held every two years, alternately for districts
and for regions and islands authorities, so that all types of authority are elected
for four years at a time.
Anyone is entitled to vote at a local government election in Great Britain
provided he or she is aged 18 years or over, is a British citizen, other
Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject to any
legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the area for
which the election is held. To qualify for registration a person must be resident
in the council area on the qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
A candidate for election as councillor normally stands as a representative of
one of the national political parties, or of some local interest, or as an
independent. Candidates must be British citizens, other Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In addition, they
must be registered as local electors in the area of the local authority to which
they seek election; or have resided in or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or
other premises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day
on which they are nominated as candidates or, in that 12 months, have had
their principal or only place of work there. No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there are a number of other disqualifica¬
tions.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local council
elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided into
electoral divisions. Districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided
into electoral ‘wards’, returning one councillor or more. In Scotland the electoral
areas in the regions and islands areas are called electoral divisions, each
returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or community, or ward of a parish or
community, forms an electoral area which returns one member or more.
The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that
for parliamentary elections. Postal voting for such elections is being introduced
in 1987. In Northern Ireland local government elections are held on the basis of
proportional representation and electoral wards are grouped into district
electoral areas.
Functions and
Services
Local authorities’ functions are far-reaching. Some are primarily duties, others
purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between county
and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible for
matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring the
support ol substantial resources while district councils as a whole administer
functions of more local significance.
English county councils are generally responsible for strategic planning.
64
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
transport planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer protection, refuse
disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the personal social
services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan areas and of
district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are responsible, for
instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most planning
applications, and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street car parks
subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to carry out some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In the metropolitan counties the district councils are responsible for the full
range of services (apart from the police, the fire service and public transport and,
in some areas only, waste regulation and disposal—see p 62). In Greater London
the boroughs and the City Corporation are responsible for a similar range of
functions but London’s police force is directly responsible to the Home
Secretary. Responsibility for passenger transport has been transferred to
London Regional Transport and in inner London education is administered by
the Inner London Education Authority, an independent and directly elected
authority with the same name, functions and geographical coverage as its
predecessor, which was an autonomous committee of the former Greater
London Council. That Council was unique among local authorities in being
responsible for land drainage for the greater part of its area (‘the London
excluded area’) and flood protection, including the Thames Barrier. These
responsibilities now rest with the Thames Water Authority.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non¬
metropolitan areas of England.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for any of their functions
to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority, other than functions
relating to education, police, the personal social services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales.
Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because of their isolation from the
mainland, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services, such as
leisure and the arts, are administered by the district councils. Responsibility for
planning, roads, water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district
through a divisional office of the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Area boards, responsible to central departments, administer locally
education, public libraries and the health and personal social services. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the Department of the
Environment, administers housing.
Internal Local authorities can co-operate or share among themselves the discharge of
Organisation of their functions. They have considerable freedom to make internal arrangements
Local Authorities for carrying out their duties. Most use the committee system, whereby policy
and principle are decided in full council, and committees administer the various
services. Parish and community councils in England and Wales are often able to
do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint committees from
time to time as necessary. Some councils have policy advisory or co-ordinating
committees with powers to originate policy, subject to the approval of the full
council. The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the council s standing orders.
A council may delegate to a committee or an officer any of its functions, except
those in connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p 66), or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute; these are legally

reserved to the council as a whole. An independent inquiry into the conduct of
business in local authorities in Great Britain was completed in June 1986; the
Government is considering its proposals.
The public (including the press) are admitted to council, committee and
sub-committee meetings, and have a right of access to agenda, reports and
minutes of meetings and certain background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances specified by legislation.
Nearly 3 million people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and technical staff, teachers, firemen,
those engaged on law and order services, and manual workers. Nearly half of all
local government workers are employed in the education service.
Although a few appointments must be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size, composition and
deployment of their workforces. In Northern Ireland, each council must by law
appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers; administrative, professional, clerical and technical staff; and manual
workers. Senior staff appointments are usually made on the recommendation of
the committee or committees particularly concerned; most junior appointments
are made by heads of departments, who are also responsible for engaging
manual workers. Appointments and engagements always conform to the
council’s set establishment, and committees are informed of appointments
which they have not made themselves.
Pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are generally a matter for
each council, although there are scales recommended by national negotiating
machinery set up by the local authorities themselves.
Authorities differ in the degree to which they employ staff to carry out certain
functions (for example, building work, street cleaning or refuse collection) or use
private firms under contract. The Government’s policy of promoting value for
money is encouraging the use of private firms where there are resultant
economies, and legislation is proposed to require authorities to open up further
services to competition from the private sector. In the specific case of building
and maintenance work, the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980
obliges authorities’ direct labour organisations to bid for such work in open
competition if they wish to undertake it.
In 1985—86 expenditure by local government in the United Kingdom was about
£35,300 million, some 26 per cent of total public expenditure. Current
expenditure amounted to some £31,300 million, and capital expenditure to
about £4,000 million. Education accounts for about 40 per cent of the total.
Most of the remainder is spent on law and order, housing and other
environmental services, personal social services and transport.
Local government current expenditure in England and Wales is financed by a
combination of central government grants and local rates (a tax based on
property values). A few services such as the police, housing and transport and
the urban programme for inner city areas receive specific central government
grants towards their cost. However, most central government support for
current spending is provided through the rate support grant. This has two
elements, domestic rate relief grant, which is paid to rating authorities as a
direct subsidy to domestic rates, and block grant. Block grant is a general grant
66
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Capital
Expenditure
Rates
which is designed to compensate for variations in the needs which local
authorities have to provide for and for differences in the resources they may be
able to raise in local rates. Each local authority’s grant is, therefore, calculated to
be sufficient for it to provide a similar level of service to that of other authorities
while at the same time charging the same rate level. This system requires an
assessment of each authority’s need to provide services which takes account of
over 60 different factors and characteristics of an authority’s area and
population.
Within this system, local authorities are free to decide on their overall level of
spending and on their priorities between particular services. However, because
of the need to control public expenditure, the methods for calculating an
authority’s entitlement to block grant have been amended in 1986—87 so that,
for the majority of authorities, grant entitlement decreases as expenditure
increases, thus providing an incentive for expenditure restraint. The previous
system of setting expenditure targets for each authority has now been
discontinued. The Government has power, subject to parliamentary approval, to
fix upper limits on the rates of selected authorities whose spending it considers
to be excessive. In 1986—87, 12 English authorities had an upper limit set on
their rate levies.
In Scotland, the grant is distributed in three parts: the ‘needs’ element,
designed to give most help to authorities whose spending needs are greatest; the
‘resources’ element, used to supplement the rate income of authorities whose
rateable value per head of population falls below a standard figure, prescribed for
each year; and the ‘domestic’ element, which compensates authorities for loss of
rate income from reductions in rate poundage which they are required to give to
householders. Local authorities are free to decide on their level of spending, but
central government can make selective grant and rate reductions in the case of
individual authorities planning excessive and unreasonable expenditure. Cur¬
rent expenditure guidelines are issued and the grant payable to authorities is
reduced where the level of expenditure planned by authorities is in excess of the
guidelines. The Government has power to set a general limitation on rates.
In Northern Ireland district councils receive central government grants
comprising specific grants which assist with the financing of certain functions
(for example, the acquisition of open space, and the provision of clean air) and
certain capital projects (for example, leisure centres), and a general grant, which
is paid by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. The general
grant compensates councils for loss of rate income arising from statutory
derating of premises; it also contains a resources element which brings the
rating resources of poorer councils up to a standard level determined by the
Department.
Local government capital expenditure (net of receipts) is financed mainly by
borrowing with the remainder coming from grants and other income. The
largest share in 1985-86—over 30 per cent in England and 40 per cent in
Wales—goes to housing. Each local authority receives from the Government a
capital expenditure allocation for the functions for which it is responsible. The
allocation may be supplemented to some extent from capital receipts achieved by
the authority. With other minor additions, these amounts constitute a ceiling
on the authority’s permitted capital expenditure for the year. They may normally
be used for whatever services the authority wishes within its legal powers.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the
GOVERNMENT
67

Finance
rateable value of a property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value) by the
rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the authority
according to its projected financial needs. Rateable values are assessed
periodically, and there is a system of appeals for disputed assessments. Crown
(government) property is not rateable but payments are made, based on values
assessed by the Treasury Valuer, in place of rates.
Government grants reduce domestic rates below the levels paid by commercial
concerns. Rating relief is available in certain circumstances on premises
adapted for the use of the disabled. Agricultural land and buildings (apart from
living accommodation) and places of religious worship are exempted from rates.
Charities pay half the full rate on premises occupied for charitable purposes and
may be given further relief by rating authorities, who can also reduce or remit
the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies. In England and Wales a
maximum of 50 per cent of the full rate may be levied on empty non-domestic
properties, with complete exemption for empty warehouses and industrial
property. In enterprise zones, which have been set up in certain areas to foster
industrial and commercial regeneration, commercial and industrial properties
are exempted from paying rates for ten years.
In Scotland industrial (including freight transport) premises are rated at 60
per cent of net annual value. Most empty properties pay no rates.
Proposals for the reform of local authority finance in Great Britain, which are
designed to strengthen local democratic accountability, were announced in
January 1986. The main features are a national non-domestic rate, the proceeds
of which would be distributed to local authorities in proportion to the number of
adults; a phased replacement of domestic rates by a community charge which
each authority would set and which would be payable by every resident adult;
and a grant system that would compensate for differences in local authorities’
needs and would provide additional help by way of a fixed sum per adult. If
adopted, the new system would first be introduced in Scotland, beginning in
1989. Its introduction in England and Wales would follow a revaluation of
non-domestic rates which is planned to be completed by 1990.
In Northern Ireland all industrial premises are fully derated as are commercial
premises in enterprise zones. Certain other properties, such as freight transport
and recreational premises, are partially derated.
Each year, local authorities receive a borrowing approval which enables them to
raise loans under their general powers to finance capital expenditure up to the
limit given in the approval. In Northern Ireland long-term borrowing by district
councils is subject to central approval; in Scotland central approval is given to
capital expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon The Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on The Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland, to
the Consolidated Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a proportion of their
reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a limited
proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Local councils normally have a finance committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. They must have their annual accounts audited by
independent auditors appointed by the Audit Commission in England and
Wales, or by the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland this role is exercised by a local government audit section
appointed by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.

Local

Complaints
System
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves
independent statutory Commissions for Local Administration comprising local
commissioners (local government Ombudsmen). The English Commission has
three local commissioners and the Welsh, one. In Scotland the statute provides
for a single commissioner. All commissioners are responsible in their particular
area for investigating citizens' allegations of injustice resulting from maladmin¬
istration by local authorities. In normal circumstances, the Commissioners can
only initiate an investigation at the request of a local councillor.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils
and certain other public bodies.
Fire Services
Every part of the United Kingdom is covered by a local authority fire service,
which is subject to some general oversight by central government. Other than in
Northern Ireland, where the fire service is financed wholly from central
government funds, the cost is shared between local authorities and central
government, the latter contribution through the rate support grant.
Each of the 64 fire authorities must by law make provision for fire-fighting,
and maintain a brigade of sufficient strength to meet all normal requirements
(in some parts of Scotland combined authorities provide fire cover). Other
authorities also maintain fire brigades, for instance, the Army and Royal Air
Force Departments of the Ministry of Defence; the Civil Aviation Authority at
airports; and some large industrial and commercial concerns. These work in
co-operation with the local authority fire services.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively. Central
government is concerned mainly with ensuring the operational efficiency of
brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to prescribe standards and general
requirements on administrative and operational matters of service-wide signifi¬
cance. These include appointments and promotions, the provision of a central
training institution, pensions and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also
required for reductions in the fire-fighting establishments of fire brigades. Each
minister is advised by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, comprising the
respective home departments, local authorities, fire service representative
organisations and certain specialist advisers. In the home departments,
inspectorates of fire services advise on operational and technical matters. Most
fire brigades include part-time personnel who provide fire cover in less-densely
populated areas in return for a retaining fee and call-out and attendance fee. Fire
authorities also employ people for duties in controls, communications and
mobilising and staff duties. There are about 40,000 full-time and 21,000
part-time operational members of fire brigades in Britain.
The standardisation of some equipment is encouraged, in order to assist
compatibility when a fire is attended by more than one brigade. The principal
types of fire-fighting appliances bought by fire authorities are based upon
specifications approved by the Secretaries of State and issued in the form of
advice by the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. The specifications aim to
describe the minimum standards required while allowing some freedom of
design.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
who exercises day-to-day control from brigade headquarters. Divisional officers
in charge of the geographical areas into which most brigade regions are divided
are responsible for mobilising forces. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and if additional resources are

required to deal with an incident, neighbouring divisions, or a neighbouring fire
brigade, are asked to provide assistance.
Fire authorities are concerned in some way with fire precautions in most
buildings used by the public and have major responsibility for enforcing
legislation concerning fire precautions. They must also make efficient arrange¬
ments for giving advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of fires, and
means of escape. Courses in fire prevention are held at the Fire Service College
for fire brigade officers. In addition to their enforcement and advisory duties,
brigades are also involved in education and publicity to promote fire safety,
particularly in the home; the Home Office also promotes fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on prevention by the Joint Fire Prevention
Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils, representing the fire
service and central and local authorities.
Research into health hazards to fire-fighters, fire prevention, fire-brigade
organisation and fire-fighting equipment is conducted by the Home Office with
the help of the fire services under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire
Research of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research
projects are undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Research and Develop¬
ment Branch or, under contract to the Home Office, by other government
agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, which is part of the Building
Research Establishment of the Department of the Environment, or by private
consultants. The Fire Research Station is the principal organisation studying
and investigating technical aspects of fire.
Fire authorities have discretion to use their brigades and equipment in a variety
of non-fire emergencies. These are known as ‘special services’ and include rail,
road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of premises, leakage
of harmful gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals from dangerous
situations. Fire authorities are entitled to levy a charge for such services.
The direct cost of damage to buildings and goods destroyed by fires in Great
Britain in 1985 amounted to an estimated £450 million (consequential losses
from the interruption of business are not included in this total). Most fires
involving heavy losses occur when the premises are unattended; and fires are
more likely to start in storage areas than in production departments. Industries
which suffer most severely include engineering and electrical firms; textiles;
food, drink and tobacco warehousing; chemical and allied industries; paper,
printing and publishing firms; and retailing.
About 900 people, particularly the elderly and young children, die in fires every
year (most of them at home) and about a further 11,000 suffer injury. Among the
chief causes of fatal fires are ignition of upholstery, bedding and clothing by
smokers’ materials and by heaters.
3 Overseas
Relations
Britain's overseas relations reflect both its traditional position as a major
trading and maritime power whose people have settled throughout the world,
its concern to help to maintain peace and to secure world-wide economic
and social progress through international co-operation. It has diplomatic
relations with over 160 countries, and with about 20 of these has common
security arrangements, principally through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa¬
tion. Commercial activities have helped Britain to maintain its position as a
world financial centre. It has considerable overseas investments, imports over a
third of its food and more than half of its raw material requirements, and
exports account for over a quarter of its gross national product. Britain provides
development assistance to over 120 independent countries as well as to its
remaining dependencies.
In the belief that its overseas objectives can best be attained through
co-operation with other nations on a regional or global basis, Britain is a
member of some 120 international organisations ranging from the world-wide
United Nations concerned with problems of world peace, international economic
co-operation and social issues to regionally based and technically orientated
bodies. In particular, it is a member of the European Community and is
increasingly co-ordinating its overseas policies through the Community's
political co-operation mechanism. As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain
is a part of a representative cross-section of the international community, which
has evolved from the British Empire (since 1945 Britain has progressively, and
largely peacefully, dismantled its Empire and prepared nearly 50 countries for
independence) and whose 49 members share a common language, common
technical standards, similar systems of law and close professional, academic
and commercial links.
Britain also has strong ties with the United States, including a common
language and similar political and cultural traditions.
A long involvement in world affairs has given Britain both a vital interest and a
firm belief in the maintenance of international order governed by respect for a
generally accepted system of law. As a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council it makes support for the United Nations a central feature of its
foreign policy.
Administration The general conduct of overseas relations is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs acting through the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and over 200 British diplomatic posts overseas. The latter
comprise embassies and high commissions in about 130 countries,1 together
with subordinate consulates-general and consulates, and missions at ten
multilateral organisations. These posts, like the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, are staffed by members of the Diplomatic Service and locally engaged
people. Excluding supporting administrative and communications services, the
staff are employed on political and economic work, export promotion and other
commercial matters, consular and immigration work, aid administration.
A few embassies are accredited to more than one country; for example, the embassy at Dakar in
Senegal is also accredited to Mauretania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Cape Verde.

information and cultural work. Other departments which have a primary
concern with overseas relations include the Ministry of Defence, the Department
of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the Overseas Development Administra¬
tion (which is part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office); but the
involvement of most has increased in recent years with the growing dependence
of domestic economic policy on international decisions and with Britain’s
membership of the European Community.
Where questions of overseas policy involve matters within the responsibility of
other departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formulates policy in
consultation with the departments concerned. The balance of responsibilities is
a matter of constant adjustment, and the department with the predominant
functional interest, even though it may be primarily domestic, takes the lead.
This is particularly so in policy concerning the European Community and
international monetary matters. In the case of policy towards the Community,
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office exercises its co-ordinating role at official
level through the machinery of the Cabinet Office.
Other bodies whose work has an overseas dimension include the British
Overseas Trade Board and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, which
provide export services for industry; the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments
and Administrations,1 which helps to arrange purchases from British aid funds
and appointments under technical co-operation programmes (as well as
providing mainly purchasing and management services to overseas govern¬
ments and institutions); and the British Council.
The British Council, established in 1934, aims to promote overseas an enduring
understanding and appreciation of Britain through cultural, educational and
technical co-operation. The activities of the Council, which has staff in over 80
countries, include the teaching of English and the recruitment of British
teachers for posts overseas; administering the Government's educational
assistance and technical co-operation training programmes; fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific areas; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of
British books and periodicals overseas and providing information through
touring exhibitions and bibliographical services; and presenting overseas the
best of British arts and culture. In Britain, the Council is concerned mainly with
arranging programmes for professional visitors and with the placing, adminis¬
tration and welfare of overseas students. A basic principle is that the Council’s
work should be of benefit both to Britain and to the receiving country.
In 1985—86 the Council assisted 24,000 overseas students, trainees and
visitors to come to Britain, and an average of 53,600 students at any one time
were learning English in the Council and associated teaching centres overseas.
Book issues made by the Council’s 116 libraries around the world totalled 6 4
million from a library stock of 21 million. The Council handled over 700,000
inquiries about Britain.
About three-quarters of funds for the Council s total programme, which
amount to an estimated £221 million in 1986-87, is provided by the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office (including the Overseas Development Administra¬
tion) and on its behalf the Council is responsible for the implementation of more
than 30 cultural agreements with other countries. Overseas it acts as education
adviser to Britain’s diplomatic missions and is responsible for educational
assistance in developing countries in which it is represented and for links and

exchanges in higher education which require official support. Increasingly, the
Council is undertaking education projects paid for by overseas clients and is
providing English classes abroad; it is estimated that these and other activities
will amount to nearly £50 million in 1986-87.
Membership of the European Community
Britain joined the European Community on 1 January 1973 and its mem¬
bership was endorsed in a national referendum in 1975. The other members are
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, the Irish
Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Britain
welcomes the accession of Portugal and Spain, which took place in January
1986.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties: the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European
Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom). The Community is the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
about a third of world trade. Designed to lay the foundations for a closer union
between the peoples of Europe and to promote economic expansion by means of
a common market and the gradual approximation of member states’ economic
policies, the Community has moved towards these objectives by abolishing
internal tariffs and certain other trade barriers, establishing a common customs
tariff, and making provision for the freer movement of labour, capital and
services. Nearly half of Britain’s trade is with the other member states. There are
also common policies for agriculture and fisheries. Overseas countries having

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Community
Institutions
special links with Community member states are accorded preferential treat¬
ment in aid and the development of trade.
A common market for coal and steel is designed to ensure an orderly supply of
these commodities to member states. The Coal and Steel Community’s funds are
raised by a levy on production, and investment grants are given to encourage the
modernisation of the industries, for research, and for social measures to help to
re-deploy coal and steel workers. Loans are also raised which promote workers'
housing and aid capital investment.
One of the Community's aims is to co-ordinate member states’ nuclear energy
industries and their other peaceful nuclear activities. Since 1959 there has
been a common market for all nuclear materials, and a control system prevents
their diversion to purposes other than those declared. There is also a
co-ordinated research programme in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
communities were merged in 1967. Each state has one representative on the
Council of Ministers; in the other institutions Britain’s representation is in line
with that of France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. English is one of
the Community’s official languages.
The Council of Ministers is the principal decision-making body for all major
Community questions, member states being represented on it by foreign or
other ministers as appropriate to the subject under discussion. The Presidency
of the Council changes at six-monthly intervals. Most Council decisions are
taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Some issues may be
decided by majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to
provisions in the Community treaties. Where very important interests of
member states are involved, however, the Council's practice is to proceed on the
basis of unanimity. The Community has agreed to improve decision-taking
through more use of majority voting on internal market directives and other
policies, while maintaining a member state's right to uphold a vital national
interest by insisting on unanimity.
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet twice a year as the
European Council, which considers both Community matters and those arising
in the context of political co-operation. It discusses general Community
problems and lays down guidelines and political direction for future work. When
necessary, the Council addresses issues unresolved in the Council of Ministers,
but Britain hopes that this will occur less frequently in future.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER), composed of
member states’ ambassadors to the Community, assists the Council by
preparing its meetings and co-ordinating the work of other subordinate bodies.
The Commission formulates policy proposals for submission to the Council of
Ministers, promotes Community interests, attempts to reconcile national
viewpoints and implements the provisions of the treaties and Community
measures. Certain executive powers of decision are delegated to it, for example,
in the areas of agricultural, trade and competition policy. It is composed of 17
commissioners (two from Britain) nominated by member governments. Each
commissioner is responsible for one or more of the main Community activities.
The Commission is pledged to act independently of national or sectional
interests and to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the interests of
the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made only after extensive
consultation with officials of the national governments and with producers,
trade unions, employers’ associations and many others.

institutions, member states or individuals, and gives preliminary rulings on
questions referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal,
its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in
member states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community
institutions and individuals. The Court consists of 13 judges assisted by six
advocates-general who make reasoned submissions concerning cases brought
before the Court to help it in its interpretation of Community law. In 1985
member states agreed to attach a court of first instance to the Court of Justice in
order to provide for the more efficient disposal of the Court’s growing workload.
The European Parliament is composed of 518 members, of whom 434 were
directly elected in 1984; the 60 Spanish and the 24 Portuguese members are
nominated at present but both countries have undertaken to hold elections. The
Parliament’s members (81 from Britain) sit according to party affiliation and not
nationality. Elections to the Parliament are held every five years, the most recent
in June 1984. The Parliament is consulted on and debates all major policy issues
of the Community. Members may question the Council of Ministers and
Commission, and have the power by a two-thirds majority to dismiss the
Commission. The Parliament can also reject in its entirety the draft annual
budget as presented by the Commission and approved by the Council. A formal
conciliation procedure has been adopted for use in the event of disagreement
between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers on matters with major
budgetary or financial implications.
The European Court of Auditors examines all Community revenue and
expenditure to see that it has been legally received and spent, and to ensure
sound financial management. It draws up an annual report, and may
submit observations on specific questions as the Community institutions
request.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing
employers’ organisations, trade unions and other interests, and is consulted by
the Council of Ministers and the Commission during the formulation of policy.
Community policies are implemented by regulations, which are legally
binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives, which are
binding, as to the result to be achieved, on member states to which they are
addressed but allow national authorities to decide on means of implementation;
decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are addressed (for example,
member states, firms or individuals); and recommendations and opinions,
which have no binding force. The Council can also indicate a general policy
direction through resolutions.
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up
machinery (now formalised in a draft treaty based on proposals submitted by
Britain) under which they consult each other before taking up final positions on
important questions of foreign policy. Known as political co-operation, these
consultations include regular meetings of foreign ministers, monthly meetings
of senior officials, and contacts at working level among those concerned with
particular questions. In addition, the 12 foreign ministries are linked by a
secure communications system and a small secretariat is being established in
Brussels to assist the Presidency.
The Community is financed by a system of levies on agricultural imports,
customs duties and the product of a notional rate of value added tax (VAT) levied
on a Community harmonised basis at a rate at present not exceeding 1 -4 per
cent. These are known as ‘own resources’.
Without some form of adjustment Britain's contributions under the system
would be much higher than its receipts from Community policies, because the
76

Common Agricultural Policy absorbs about two-thirds of Community spending
and Britain's agricultural sector is relatively small. This problem was foreseen
during the accession negotiations, and Britain was given an assurance that, if
unacceptable situations arose, the very survival of the Community would
demand that its institutions found equitable solutions.
In 1980 the Community recognised that there was a problem for Britain and
refunds were made for each year in the period from 1980 to 1983. In June 1984
the European Council (meeting in Fontainebleau) reached agreement on a fairer
and more soundly based system for Britain’s contributions, under which Britain
obtains a rebate of 66 per cent of the gap between Britain’s share of VAT
payments and its share of Community expenditure. In addition, agreement has
been reached on measures covering budgetary discipline and limitations on
increases in agricultural spending.
The VAT ceiling of 1 per cent has been increased to- 1-4 per cent for the
Community as a whole, partly to meet the costs of enlargement.
In addition to agriculture, the Community budget includes spending on
regional and social policies, projects concerned with research, energy, industry
and transport, and aid to developing countries.
Within the framework of political co-operation member states discuss a wide
range of foreign policy issues. At the United Nations and in other international
bodies their actions are closely co-ordinated and they vote together on most
major issues. The cohesion of member states has played a key role in the process
initiated at the 1975 Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe (see p 83), and especially in the setting up of the Conference on
Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe,
which opened in Stockholm in January 1984. They are also pledged to continue
seeking constructive, comprehensive and realistic dialogue with the Soviet
Union and the countries of Eastern Europe, and they attach the highest
importance to achieving effective arms control and disarmament agreements.
In July 1980, the European Council’s Venice Declaration stated that a lasting
solution to the problem of the Middle East required the mutual acceptance of
two basic principles—the right of all countries in the area, including Israel, to
secure existence within guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination. After Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Britain,
France and Italy contributed to the multinational force deployed there from the
end of that year until early 1984. Member states have consistently emphasised
the importance to any future settlement of the complete withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon except for those whose presence is requested by the
Lebanese Government, and the obligation on all parties to co-operate with the
UN Interim Force in Lebanon. Member states have also followed with concern the
conflict between Iran and Iraq and in February 1986 expressed their support for
a UN Security Council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire.
Member states are working closely to strengthen relations with Central
America in order to support the efforts of the Contadora Group (Colombia,
Mexico, Panama and Venezuela) to negotiate a comprehensive and verifiable
peace agreement in Central America. In November 1985 a conference of foreign
ministers from Community, Central American and Contadora countries met in
Luxembourg to carry forward the dialogue initiated at a previous meeting in
Costa Rica in 1984. It concluded with the signature of a Final Act recording
agreement that the dialogue should be continued and developed, and of a
co-operation agreement between the Community and the Central American
countries and Panama providing for closer economic links and a substantial
increase in Community aid to the region. Member states have made clear their
conviction that the conflicts of the region cannot be resolved by armed force.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
77

Aid
Member states have deplored the Soviet Union’s continuing occupation of
Afghanistan and continue to call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying
lorces in order that a permanent settlement can be reached restoring the right of
the Afghan people to self-determination.
In order to emphasise the importance they attach to the abolition of apartheid,
member states have adopted a package of restrictive and positive measures
towards South Africa. They have called for the release of all political prisoners,
and an end to the ban on political parties and to discriminatory legislation in
South Africa. Member states have also urged the South African Government to
enter into a genuine dialogue with representatives of the black population, and
in mid-1986 Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe,
visited Southern Africa on their behalf in an unsuccessful attempt to establish
conditions in which such a dialogue could begin. Member states are also
consulting with other industrialised countries on further measures which may
be needed, including a ban on new investment in South Africa and a ban on
coal, iron and steel imports. The Community has launched a programme of
social and educational assistance to the black population of South Africa.
In response to growing evidence of state-supported terrorism by Libya and
other countries, member states agreed early in 1986 to restrict the freedom of
movement of Libyan diplomats, to reduce their number, to impose strict visa
requirements on Libyans, and to reaffirm an export ban on arms or other
military equipment to Libya. Britain broke off diplomatic relations with Libya in
1984 following the death of a policewoman in London caused by shots fired from
the Libyan People’s Bureau.
On most international trade matters the Council of Ministers agrees a common
position, with the Commission speaking, and, where necessary, negotiating on
behalf of the Community (for example, in the current preparations for a new
round of multilateral trade negotiations within the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and for the renegotiation of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement).
Association or co-operation agreements giving preferential access to Community
markets have been concluded with most countries in the Mediterranean basin.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements have been concluded with individual
countries in South Asia and Latin America and also with two regional
organisations—the Association of South East Asian Nations and the Andean
Pact. Regular discussions covering trade and other matters are held with
regional groupings of Latin American. Arab and South-East Asian countries.
The Community has also improved progressively its generalised scheme of
preferences designed to benefit the poorest developing countries. The scheme
provides duty-free access for almost all manufactured and semi-manufactured
goods exported by developing countries and preferential access for agricultural
products. The latest scheme started in 1981 and runs for ten years.
The third Lome Convention, which governs aid, trade and co-operation between
the Community and 66 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific (ACP) was signed in December 1984 and came into force in May 1986.
Over half the ACP countries are members of the Commonwealth. The Conven¬
tion, which covers the period from 1985 to 1989, provides for aid and European
Investment Bank lending of about £5,500 million, covering industrial and
agricultural co-operation, a scheme designed to help stabilise the commodity
export earnings of the ACP countries and assistance for ACP mineral producers
whose production and income suffer from temporary disruptions beyond their
control. It also offers duty-free access to the Community for ACP exports of all
industrial and most agricultural goods, including privileged access for sugar,
bananas, rum and beef. Emphasis is being placed on food production and on
78

measures to prevent desertification. All British dependent territories (with the
exception of Bermuda, Gibraltar and Hong Kong), together with the overseas
territories of other Community members, are formally associated with the
Community under provisions parallel to those of the Lome Convention with
similar aid and trade benefits.
Britain played a leading part in urging the Community to adopt an aid
programme encompassing those developing countries (many of which are
among the world’s poorest) not covered by the Lome Convention or having any
other special relationship with the Community. The programme for these
non-associated states has grown steadily since 1976 and was worth some £86
million in 1985. Priority is given to rural development and agricultural
production in the poorest countries. In 1985 the Community spent some £330
million on food aid, of which Britain’s share was about £77 million, much of
which went to Africa. The British Government is pressing for improvements to
the Community’s food aid programme to make it more responsive to the real
needs of recipients and to give higher priority to emergency relief.
Internal Policies As a major trading nation, Britain believes that the Community’s common
market should be completed by removing the many barriers which still impede
the movement of goods and services between member states. Since 1982 the
European Council has emphasised the need for action along these lines on the
grounds that European industry cannot become fully competitive in world
markets unless the national markets of member states are closely integrated,
and in 1985 the Community agreed on a target date of 1992 for the completion
of a genuinely free internal market. In particular the British Government wants
swift action to open up public purchasing to competition, the liberalisation of
inland, sea and air transport services, full freedom of establishment for the
professions, a European capital market and a liberalised European financial
services industry capable of meeting competition from Japan and the United
States.
The Common Agricultural Policy is designed to ensure food supplies at
reasonable prices for consumers and a fair standard of living for farmers.
Producers’ returns are supported by a combination of charges on imports and
internal support prices maintained by intervention buying where necessary.
The Common Fisheries Policy, revised in 1983, governs access to coastal waters,
conservation of stocks, the allocation of quotas among member states, and
enforcement of these measures.
The European Social Fund assists areas of high unemployment by providing
grants towards schemes of training, job creation and geographical mobility of
workers. The European Regional Development Fund provides grants for
industrial and infrastructure projects in the less-developed or industrially
declining regions of the Community with the aim of reducing existing
imbalances or preventing the creation of new ones. In 1985, Britain received
£345 million (24 per cent of the resources) from the regional fund and £308
million (24 per cent) from the social fund. The British, Irish and Italian
governments have made a number of proposals designed to promote enterprise
and self-employment, flexible employment patterns and training, and to tackle
long-term unemployment in the Community.
Britain also receives about a fifth of the lending of the European Investment
Bank, which was set up in 1958 to provide finance on a non-profit-making basis
for investment to develop the Community’s less-favoured regions, to modernise
industry and to help projects of common interest to two or more member states.
Community industrial policy includes measures designed to deal with the
problems of the steel industry during its restructuring; temporary mandatory
production quotas have been in force for several years in order to cut back
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
79
production to the level of demand, thereby allowing economic price levels to be
obtained. The Community is also involved in helping to create the right climate
for high technology industries to flourish. The ESPRIT programme is bringing
together many of the European computer companies in a common programme
of research and development in information technology, while the nuclear
fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire is designed to develop new
energy sources. The EUREKA programme, launched in 1985 following a French
initiative, is designed to encourage the development of new technologies in
Community and other European countries.
The European Monetary System was established in 1979 to promote monetary
stability in Europe. It consists of an exchange-rate mechanism, a monetary unit
known as the European Currency Unit (ECU—based on a ‘basket’ of national
currencies including sterling, the value of which is recalculated daily) which is
used within the Community for budgetary and other purposes, and enlarged
Community short- and medium-term credit facilities. The member states are
also committed to the establishment of a European Monetary Fund. Britain has
participated in the system from the outset, although not in the exchange-rate
arrangements, and has deposited 20 per cent of its gold and dollar currency
reserves with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund in exchange for ECUs.
The Government intends that Britain should join the exchange-rate mechanism
when conditions permit.
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 49 independent states with a
combined population of over 1.100 million, about a quarter of the world total.
Commonwealth members are a representative cross-section of nations at all
stages of social and economic development. They include some of the richest and
poorest members of the world community and also some of the largest and
smallest. Their peoples are drawn from practically all the world's main races,
from all continents and from many faiths. Britain participates fully in all
Commonwealth activities and values it as a means of consulting and co¬
operating with peoples of widely different cultures and perspectives, thereby
increasing international understanding, stability and peace, and contributing
to more balanced global economic development.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji!
The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati,
Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon
Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu,
Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu
are special members, entitled to take part in all functional Commonwealth
meetings and activities but not the two-yearly Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meetings. The Queen is recognised as head of the Commonwealth;
she is also head of State in 18 countries.
The origin of the Commonwealth lies in the gradual granting of self-
government to the older-established British colonies (later known as the
Dominions) in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa1 where
European settlement had occurred on a large scale. Their fully independent
status in relation to Britain was legally formulated in the Statute of Westminster
oi 1931. The modern Commonwealth, comprising republics and national
monarchies as well as monarchies under the Queen, was made possible by the
South Africa ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth in 1961.

decision of India in 1949 to remain a member while becoming a republic. Since
then, the great majority of Britain's former dependent territories have attained
their independence and have voluntarily joined the Commonwealth.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain participates in a system of mutual
consultation and co-operation which benefits member countries and contri¬
butes to international understanding. It led, for instance, to the Commonwealth
playing a significant role in the events leading to Zimbabwe's independence in
April 1980.
Consultation takes place through diplomatic representatives known as High
Commissioners, meetings of heads of Government, specialised conferences of
other ministers and officials, expert groups, and discussions at international
conferences and the United Nations. Trade and cultural exhibitions and
conferences of professional and unofficial medical, cultural, educational and
economic organisations are other ways in which frequent contacts are made.
Heads of Government usually meet every two years, most recently in Nassau in
1985; they will next meet in Canada in 1987. Proceedings are normally in
private, which facilitates a frank and informal exchange of views. No votes are
taken, decisions being reached by consensus. These meetings allow Prime
Ministers and Presidents to discuss international issues and decide on collective
initiatives. Common views on matters of major international concern are
formulated and reflected in the communiques issued at the end of the meetings.
Occasionally, separate declarations are made on particular issues. These have
included the 1971 Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, the 1977
Gleneagles statement, which commits member governments to take every
practical step to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa, and the 1985
Accord on Southern Africa, which provides for measures designed to impress on
South Africa the urgency of dismantling the apartheid system. Following the
failure of Commonwealth and other attempts in 1986 to encourage the evolution
of a political dialogue leading to the establishment of a non-racial and
representative government, a mini-summit of Commonwealth leaders, meeting
in London in August, agreed on the need for further measures against South
Africa. Britain, while believing that economic sanctions would be counter¬
productive to promoting peaceful change, agreed to impose voluntary bans on
new investment in, and the promotion of tourism to. South Africa, and to
implement any European Community decision to ban the import of coal, iron
and steel (see p 77).
With many small states among its members the Commonwealth has expressed
concern about their security and development. At Nassau Commonwealth
leaders called for action which would reduce the vulnerability of small states
while not diminishing their status as independent, sovereign and equal
members of the world community. British policy is to co-operate with other
member states in order to increase the security of small nations by encouraging
regional co-operation and by providing economic aid and technical assistance.
Finance ministers meet annually to discuss world economic problems, and in
recent years have paid particular attention to the problems of development and
the establishment of a fairer international economic order. Other meetings
include those of agriculture, education, health and law ministers which take
place every two or three years. Ministers of industry, labour and employment,
trade and women’s affairs also meet.
The Commonwealth Secretariat, established in London in 1965 and financed by
member states, is the main agency for multilateral communication between
them. It is headed by a Secretary-General appointed by heads of Government
and responsible to member states collectively.

Organisations
The Secretariat promotes consultation, disseminates information on matters
of common concern, and organises meetings and conferences, including those
of heads of Government and of ministers. It co-ordinates many Commonwealth
activities related to international economic, social and political affairs, includ¬
ing food production and rural development, the role of women in development,
youth programmes, management development, science and technology, law and
health. The Secretariat also administers the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Co-operation.
Because of its neutral position the Secretariat has been able to make its good
offices available in cases of dispute, and has carried out, on request, special
assignments requiring demonstrable impartiality.
Britain plays an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, established within the Secretariat to provide technical
assistance for economic and social development in Commonwealth developing
countries, and contributes almost a third of its income. The Fund provides
experts to undertake advisory assignments or fill specific posts and uses
consultancy firms to make studies for governments. Its fellowships and training
programme is of particular help in raising levels of technical, industrial,
managerial and other skills, and makes wide use of training facilities within
developing member countries for the benefit of other developing countries. It
has a special programme to help countries develop their exports, another on
food production and rural development and a small technical assistance group
to give advice in key areas. An industrial development unit, the main executive
agency of the Commonwealth Action Programme of Industrial Co-operation,
investigates the feasibility of establishing new industries in developing coun¬
tries and helps to prepare and initiate agreed projects.
Expenditure by Britain on bilateral technical co-operation with Common¬
wealth developing countries in 1985 was nearly £126 million, the greater part
being spent on financing staff for service with Commonwealth governments and
in financing training places in Britain for people from Commonwealth
countries. In particular, Britain is a major contributor to the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a system of awards for people of high
intellectual promise to study in Commonwealth countries other than their own.
It was agreed in 1984 that the number of awards would be increased to about
1,700 of which Britain would provide some 800. In 1986, the Overseas
Development Administration's Shared Scholarship Scheme, jointly funded by
the Government, universities and polytechnics, was introduced to finance 150
new scholarships each year over a period of five years, the awards being open to
private sector students from developing Commonwealth countries. Other
assistance includes sending volunteers to serve overseas, consultancy services,
the supply of training and research equipment and the provision of advice by
British scientific and technical institutions. (Financial aid to Commonwealth
developing countries totalled £443 million in 1985 and most received invest¬
ment finance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation.)
The Commonwealth Foundation was established in 1966 and reconstituted as
an international organisation in 1983. Financed by member governments, it
promotes closer co-operation among professional and other non-governmental
organisations within the Commonwealth. It has assisted over 30 Common¬
wealth professional associations, many of which it helped to establish, and has
assisted in the creation and growth of many national ones; it has also supported
16 multidisciplinary professional centres.
The Commonwealth Institute, financed largely by the British Government,
promotes knowledge about the Commonwealth through films, library services.

lecture tours by members of the staff and study conferences for students; its
headquarters in London has a permanent publicity exhibition depicting the life
of member states, each country financing its own stand. The Royal Common¬
wealth Society, which is over 100 years old, is a centre for study and discussion,
its library in London having one of the largest collections on the Commonwealth.
The Society has branches in many countries.
In keeping with the fact that the Commonwealth is an association of peoples
as well as governments, many unofficial organisations, professional bodies and
voluntary societies provide machinery for co-operation. Professional bodies
include associations of architects, doctors, engineers, journalists, lawyers,
librarians, magistrates, museum curators, nurses, pharmacists, planners,
surveyors and veterinary surgeons. Other organisations include the Common¬
wealth Parliamentary Association, which organises an annual conference of
parliamentarians, the Commonwealth Press Union, the Commonwealth Broad¬
casting Association, the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, the Com¬
monwealth Games Federation and the Commonwealth Arts Association.
DEPENDENCIES There are 15 remaining British dependent territories: Anguilla; Bermuda;
British Antarctic Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory; British Virgin
Islands; Cayman Islands; Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Hong Kong; Montserrat;
Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno; St Helena; St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension, Tristan da Cunha); South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;
and the Turks and Caicos Islands. They have a combined population of 5-5
million, of which 5-3 million live in Hong Kong. Few are rich in natural
resources, and some are scattered groups of islands. There are no permanent
inhabitants in the British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory or
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Most dependencies have
considerable self-government with their own legislature and civil service. Britain
is generally responsible, through a Governor, for defence, internal security and
foreign affairs.
It is Britain's policy to give independence to those dependencies that want it,
and not to force it on those which do not. In the case of the Falkland Islands,
which is the subject of a territorial claim by Argentina, the inhabitants wish to
retain the link with Britain. The Government is committed to the defence of the
Islanders’ right to live under a government of their own choosing. The Islanders’
right of self-determination is reflected in the new Falkland Islands Constitution,
which came into effect in 1985.
Argentina and Chile have claims to territory which overlaps part of the British
Antarctic Territory. Claims to territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic, however,
are suspended by the provisions of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial claim by Spain, which imposed border
restrictions in the 1960s. Since the return of democracy to Spain, Britain and
Spain have reached agreement on the method for handling their differences over
Gibraltar, Spanish restrictions being lifted in February 1985. Britain wishes to
see the development of practical co-operation between Gibraltar and Spain to the
benefit of both peoples and remains committed to honouring the wishes of the
people of Gibraltar as to their future.
In 1984 an agreement was signed between Britain and the People’s Republic of
China on the future of Hong Kong. Under the agreement, which was ratified by
the two Governments in 1985, Britain will continue to be responsible for the
administration of Hong Kong until 1997, when the territory will be restored to
China. The Chinese Government will then establish a Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, which will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in
foreign and defence affairs. It will be vested with executive, legislative and
independent judicial powers and its government will be composed of local

inhabitants. The laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically
unchanged, as will its present social and economic systems and its way of life.
Private property rights and other rights and freedoms will be protected by law.
These arrangements will remain in place for 50 years after 1997.
International Peace and Security
Britain is concerned to protect its territorial integrity and political indepen¬
dence, as well as the interests of its dependencies and of its allies, and pursues
these objectives through a national security policy in which deterrence and
defence are coupled with efforts towards removing or alleviating the causes of
international tension and achieving balanced and verifiable international arms
control and disarmament.
British defence policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)1 which member countries regard as their guarantee of security, freedom
and well-being, and as an important contributor to international peace and
stability. The purpose of NATO is to enable its member countries to maintain
peace with freedom. It pursues a strategy of deterrence, designed to convince
any potential aggressor that the use of force, or the threat of it, carries risks far
outweighing any likely advantage. At the same time NATO countries seek
through international negotiations significant reductions in the level of nuclear
and conventional forces.
Britain’s defence resources are concentrated almost exclusively on key NATO
tasks. However, the Government’s defence policy is also designed to promote,
whenever possible, British and more general Western interests outside the
NATO area. In addition, Britain demonstrates its world-wide interests by
periodic military deployments and exercises overseas; by supporting United
Nations and other peacekeeping efforts; and by providing military assistance
and training to a number of friendly countries.
Britain seeks improvements in East-West relations based on a broader
understanding and on the recognition that East and West have a common
interest in peace and security at a lower level of weapons. The Government
believes that both sides should avoid policies which risk provoking confronta¬
tion and should aim instead for mutual accommodation and co-operation while
exercising restraint in the conduct of international relations both in Europe and
in the rest of the world. This is explicitly recognised in the Final Act of the 1975
Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which states that
European security has to be considered in the broader context of world security.
Britain is committed to doing everything possible to reduce the risks of war and
to avoid misunderstanding. The Government is following a policy of increased
contacts at all levels with the Soviet Union and its allies, and welcomed the 1985
summit meeting in Geneva when the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
to accelerate the pace of nuclear arms negotiations and seek better relations
between their two countries through regular meetings. The Soviet Union’s
invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 and its continued occupation of that
country remain, however, an obstacle to improved relations.
Britain attaches great importance to the full and balanced implementation by
all participants of the provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act for increased
stability in Europe and improved co-operation between the 35 European and
North American signatory states. While not a legally binding document, the
NATOs 16 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Turkey and the United States. France and Spain do not participate in NATO's integrated
military structure. &

and peoples in East and West. To this end it contains undertakings about
security, respect for human rights, and co-operation in economic, humani¬
tarian and other matters. Follow-up meetings took place in Belgrade (1977 to
1978) and Madrid (1980 to 1983), and a further follow-up meeting will be
convened in Vienna in November 1986. As a result of the Madrid Conference,
where it was decided that renewed efforts should be made to give full effect to the
Final Act, an experts’ meeting on the subject of human rights took place in
Ottawa in 1985. This was followed by a cultural forum in Budapest later in the
year. A meeting on human contacts took place in Berne in April 1986.
At the Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and
Disarmament in Stockholm, which began in January 1984 at the behest of the
Madrid Conference, Britain and its NATO allies have proposed a set of measures
to build confidence and security in Europe by creating greater openness about
normal military practices (for example, exercises) and thereby reducing the
likelihood of an outbreak of hostilities by accident, misunderstanding or design.
Together with France, the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain is a
signatory to the 1972 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, which reaffirms the
four countries’ rights and responsibilities there, and provides for greatly
improved travel and communications facilities between West Berlin and the
Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin,
and for the maintenance and development of the ties between West Berlin and
the Federal Republic.
Britain is committed to the search for balanced and verifiable measures of arms
control and disarmament, and has played a prominent part in multilateral
disarmament negotiations. Britain is a participating state in the Conference on
Disarmament at Geneva, in the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions
negotiations at Vienna, and in the Conference on Confidence- and Security-
Building Measures and Disarmament at Stockholm; it also takes an active part
in disarmament deliberations under the auspices of the United Nations.
Britain strongly supports the negotiations between the United States and the
Soviet Union on nuclear and space arms, which began in Geneva in March 1985.
It fully shares the agreed objective of working out effective agreements aimed at
preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and
reducing nuclear arms and at strengthening strategic stability. The British
Government supports the latest proposals of the United States which involve,
among other things, a 50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear missiles and the
elimination within three years of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
Britain’s nuclear deterrent is a minimum force which will remain so after the
introduction in service of the Trident system, and is very small in comparison
with Soviet nuclear forces. The priority therefore is for reductions in the
arsenals of the superpowers. None the less, Britain has made it clear that, if the
US and Soviet strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced and there
had been no significant increases in Soviet defences, Britain would review the
position and consider how best it could contribute to arms control in the light of
the reduced threat.
Britain has played a leading part in strengthening the regime of non¬
proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is a party to the most widely supported arms
control agreement in existence, the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is
designed both to stop the spread of nuclear weapons by providing an assurance
through international safeguards that nuclear facilities of non-nuclear-weapon
states will not be used for making such weapons and to protect the right of all

and Chemical

countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Britain was the first
nuclear-weapon state to conclude an agreement with the International Atomic
Energy Agency, which administers the safeguards. Britain reaffirmed its full
support for the Treaty at a review conference in 1985, and has been active in
strengthening it by seeking the widest possible adherence. It has also
undertaken not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states
which have internationally binding commitments not to manufacture or acquire
nuclear explosive devices (except in the case of an attack on British interests by
such a state in association with a nuclear-weapon state). Britain believes that
limiting the security assurances to these states provides further support for
nuclear non-proliferation.
Britain is also fully committed to progress towards a comprehensive, verifiable
ban on all nuclear tests, and in recent years has tabled papers on verification at
the Conference on Disarmament. However, solutions to verification problems
need to be clearer before negotiations can be resumed.
The British Government thinks that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones in certain parts of the world could contribute to regional security, to
non-proliferation and to disarmament in general, provided that nuclear
weapons do not already feature in the security of the region involved and all
states concerned are prepared to participate on the basis of agreements freely
entered into and in keeping with internationally recognised principles.
Two such nuclear-free zones have been established: the zone created by the
1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America and that created by the 1985 Nuclear
Free Zone Treaty in the South Pacific. Britain was the first nuclear-weapon state
to ratify the two additional protocols in the Tlatelolco Treaty under which such
states undertake to respect the aims and provisions of the Treaty, not to
contribute to any violation of its terms, and not to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against a contracting party. Britain is studying carefully the South
Pacific Treaty and draft protocols similar to those in the 1967 Treaty before
taking any decision on ratification.
As a result of a British initiative, another category of weapons of mass
destruction, biological weapons, is the subject of the 1972 Convention on
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological
(Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. A conference to review
the Convention is to be held in Geneva in the autumn of 1986. Britain is also
committed to achieving a comprehensive and verifiable world-wide ban on
chemical weapons, having abandoned its chemical warfare capability in the late
1950s. In 1976 it tabled a draft treaty and in recent years has introduced a
number of important working papers into the Conference. These have included
detailed proposals on compliance, including a system of challenge inspection in
cases of suspected non-compliance, the verification of non-production of
banned chemicals, and measures to prevent misuse of civil chemical facilities.
Conventional weapons are by far the largest component of national armouries
and Britain has welcomed the completion of a UN study which emphasised the
responsibility of all states to seek reductions in conventional forces. In
particular, Britain believes in the value of regional agreements as a means of
acilitating such reductions. In the Vienna negotiations, Britain, together with
its NATO allies, is working for an agreement with the Warsaw Pact participants
which would contribute to a more stable relationship and strengthen peace and
security in Europe. This requires an approximate parity between NATO and
Warsaw Pact forces in central Europe where the Warsaw Pact troops currently
outnumber those of NATO by at least 200,000. Progress in the talks has been
slight, mainly because of a long-standing disagreement over the size of Eastern

forces in the reduction area. In an attempt to break the deadlock, the West tabled
new proposals in December 1985 which accept reductions in the framework of a
first-phase agreement without insisting on a prior agreement on force levels.
These proposals, based on ideas put forward by Britain and the Federal Republic
of Germany, provide for initial reductions of 5,000 US and 11,500 Soviet troops
in central Europe, a subsequent collective commitment not to increase forces for
three years in that area, and frequent inspections to ensure compliance.
Concerned about the rising scale of military expenditure in the world, Britain
has supported proposals at the United Nations for the balanced and verifiable
reduction of military budgets. Britain and its allies and partners have
participated actively in developing a standardised system for reporting annual
military expenditure to establish a basis for future comparison. Britain
welcomes efforts to promote increased openness in the reporting of military
expenditure and to this end has submitted figures on its military budget.
British experts have taken part in a number of UN studies on aspects of arms
control and disarmament.
Britain and the United Nations
Support for the United Nations and the purposes and principles of its Charter
has been a cornerstone of British policy since 1945, for Britain sees a strong and
effective United Nations as a means of pursuing and achieving many of its
foreign policy objectives such as the peaceful resolution of disputes, disarma¬
ment and arms control, the protection of human rights and the promotion of the
rule of law. It believes that all member states have a responsibility to ensure that
the organisation's efforts are devoted to the furtherance of the principles
enshrined in the Charter, and has suggested reforms to make it more effective.
The maintenance of international peace and security was the primary purpose
envisaged for the United Nations at the time of its establishment. Britain
believes that it is appropriate for the United Nations, as the only forum in which
almost the whole international community is represented, to seek to resolve
disputes which threaten peace and stability whether on a regional or world
scale. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain plays an active
role in the Council’s work and has sought to develop and improve its role in the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
In 1985, for example, Britain expressed the belief that the Council should
engage in more preventive diplomacy in an effort to help countries engaged in a
dispute before it reached an acute stage. Britain proposed a new form of Council
meeting of a private and formal nature which would include states engaged in
the dispute under discussion but would minimise opportunities for propa¬
ganda. Britain has also put forward proposals for rationalising the work of the
General Assembly.
Another British concern is that the United Nations should have an effective
peacekeeping capacity. Britain contributes to the UN force in Cyprus and
provides logistic support for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
Britain has consistently supported the efforts of the United Nations to promote
human rights throughout the world through the establishment of international¬
ly accepted standards. The UN Charter itself includes among the purposes of the
United Nations the achievement of international co-operation in promoting and
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without
distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. Britain believes that this and
the subsequent practice of the United Nations has established human rights as
a legitimate matter for international concern and that the UN Charter imposes
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
87
Economic and
Social Affairs
on member governments an obligation to co-operate with appropriate UN bodies
in the pursuit of policies which promote human rights.
Fundamental human rights provisions are set out in the Universal Declara¬
tion of Human Rights proclaimed by the General Assembly in 1948, and in the
two International Covenants (one on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and
the other on Civil and Political Rights) which impose legal obligations on those
who ratify them and which came into force in 1976. Britain played a large part in
their drafting and ratified the two Covenants in 1976. It also accepted the
optional Article 41 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognising the
competence of the Human Rights Committee established under this Covenant to
receive and consider state complaints. (It is not party to the Optional Protocol to
the Covenant which recognises the right of individuals to submit communica¬
tions to the Committee; Britain recognises the right of individual petition under
the European Convention on Human Rights.) Britain is also a party to other
international instruments, including conventions on the elimination of racial
discrimination and of discrimination against women (Britain deposited its
instrument of ratification in April 1986), prevention of genocide, the abolition of
slavery, the status of refugees and stateless persons, the political rights of
women, and consent to marriage. In March 1985 Britain signed the UN
Convention against Torture which was adopted with British support by the
General Assembly in December 1984.
The adoption of conventions and covenants in itself is insufficient to secure
the protection of human rights. It is up to states themselves to do that. Britain
constantly urges states to adhere to those standards which have been agreed
internationally as the basis of that protection. Britain has also supported the
establishment of additional mechanisms such as the appointment of Special
Rapporteurs or Representatives of the UN Commission on Human Rights to
investigate human rights abuses in specific countries or globally.
Britain plays a leading part in the discussion of human rights in the various
multilateral fora provided by the United Nations. In 1984 it was re-elected to the
UN Commission on Human Rights for a further three-year term, and the British
delegation will continue to build on the initiatives which it and other countries
have taken there. Britain is also represented on the UN Sub-Commission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, on the Human Rights
Committee (which monitors the implementation of the provisions of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the parties to it), on the
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination established under the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (to which a
British expert was elected in January 1986), and on the UN Commission on the
Status of Women.
The UN Charter states that ‘the promotion of the economic and social
advancement of all peoples' is one of the principal aims of the United Nations,
and an estimated 90 per cent of the organisation's efforts, in terms of resources
and personnel, is now employed to this end. With the growing concern for the
problems of development, the main emphasis has become increasingly the
provision of direct assistance for member states. The UN system is now the
largest single source of technical assistance for developing countries, as well as
providing considerable emergency and relief aid and assistance for refugees.
(The provision of capital assistance has been generally confined to the World
Bank group and regional development banks whose operations are usually
considered separately from those of the rest of the UN system.)
Successive British governments have affirmed their support for the functional
and developmental work of the United Nations. Britain is the sixth largest
contributor to the UN’s regular budget, providing some £25-3 million, 4-67 per
88
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cent of the total, in 1985. In addition, it contributed some £9 million to the
World Health Organisation, £4-7 million to the International Labour Organisa¬
tion, £6-8 million to the Food and Agriculture Organisation and £6-3 million to
the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Britain provides
considerable contributions to the UN’s voluntary funds, donating £20 million in
1985 for the UN Development Programme, £15-5 million for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, £5 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees, £8-4 million for the UN Children’s Fund, £4-5 million for
the UN Fund for Population Activities, and about £0-5 million for the World Food
Programme.
In the deliberations of the governing bodies of the various agencies and
programmes, Britain encourages the deployment of the resources towards the
poorest countries and the poorest communities in the developing world. It also
seeks to promote the most efficient use of UN development resources and
improvements in the co-ordination, control and effectiveness of the system, in
order to avoid unnecessary duplication by the various agencies.
In December 1985, Britain withdrew from the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The decision followed a period
of notice of withdrawal during which Britain worked within UNESCO to secure
its reform. Although Britain supports the ideals and objectives contained in
UNESCO’s constitution, it has major doubts about the effectiveness with which
the Organisation has been pursuing them. In particular, it considers that
UNESCO is harmfully politicised, has been used to attack values it was designed
to uphold, has suffered from inefficient management, implements certain
programmes which contain meaningless studies and duplicate the work of other
UN agencies, and in general lacks discrimination in its creation of activities.
Other International Organisations
Britain is a member of many other international organisations, including those
concerned with the management of the world economy. It is a founder member
of the International Monetary Fund, established in 1945 (along with the World
Bank) to regulate the international financial system and to provide a source of
credit for member countries facing balance of payments problems, and has
welcomed the creation by the Fund of facilities to provide special assistance to
developing countries experiencing financial or trading difficulties. It is a strong
supporter of efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
liberalise further, and promote the growth of, world trade, and to improve the
developing countries’ participation in it.
Britain is also a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). An instrument for intergovernmental co-operation among
24 industrialised countries, the OECD’s aims are to promote policies designed
to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment, and a
rising standard of living in member countries while maintaining financial
stability, and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy; to
assist developing countries; and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on
a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international
obligations.
Other organisations to which Britain belongs or extends support are more
restricted in their operations and include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Americas and Asia and specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
With 20 other nations Britain is a member of the Council of Europe, which
aims to provide the widest possible European forum for the discussion of
political, economic, social, cultural and scientific issues with a view to achieving
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
89
Official and

greater unity between its members. Membership is open to any European
parliamentary democracy which accepts the principles of the rule of law and the
protection of human rights. The Council was responsible for the adoption in
1950 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain became a
party in 1951. In 1985, with Britain’s support, the Council adopted a
declaration reaffirming its commitment to respect for human rights and calling
upon all countries to comply fully with their international obligations in this
area. In January 1986 Britain renewed its acceptance for a further five years of
the optional articles of the Convention which recognise both the right of
individual petition and the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of
Human Rights.
Development Co-operation
The basic objective of Britain s aid programme is the promotion of sustainable,
non-inflationary economic and social progress and the alleviation of poverty in
developing countries. Britain’s ability to support development overseas is
dependent on the state of its own economy, and alongside development
objectives, due weight is given to political, commercial and industrial considera¬
tions in the deployment of aid resources.
Official aid is only one aspect of Britain’s support for overseas development.
Private investment is also important and has benefited from the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979. Britain is one of the world’s largest overseas
investors: in 1985 estimated net outward direct investment by British com¬
panies in developing countries amounted to £2,550 million out of a total of
£6,680 million. Such investment is important not only because of the money
provided but because of the transfer of skills, management expertise and the
development of indigenous resources which accompany it. Trade, too, is vital
developing countries providing nearly a fifth of British imports in recent years’
Aid is also provided by voluntary societies which concentrate their activities in
the poorest countries. Some of these societies’ activities receive substantial
support from the official aid programme.
Britain’s aid represents part of a wider Western effort to help developing
countries. In 1985 total net official development assistance disbursed by
members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, comprising 18 main donor countries
and the European Commission, amounted to $29,580 million. Members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries provided $3,000 million and
countries belonging to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (the Soviet
bloc countries) an estimated $3,120 million.
In 1985 total official flows1 of aid amounted to some £1,478 million net, of which
£1,181 million represented official development assistance and £297 million
other official flows. Of the former, bilateral aid accounted for £663 million
including technical co-operation funds of £257 million; some £518 million was
provided through multilateral agencies. Repayments of capital and payments of
interest on loans came to £89 million and £69 million respectively; another £24
million of capital repayments and £2 million of interest were cancelled.
Aid performance is commonly measured as a proportion of gross national
' T°,tal offlcial flows' is an international reporting concept. Its main component—official
development assistance—is defined as official flows for development purposes with a grant
(concessional) element of 25 per cent or more. The main British reporting concept is public
expenditure on overseas aid which differs from total official flows by excluding certain British
flows which benefit developing countries but are not considered developmental, fnd by recordw
?rt l 0r!S t0 multilateral agencies at a different time. All concepts can be measured
before (gross) or after (net) deducting capital repayments.

product (GNP), particularly with reference to the two UN targets for resource
transfers to developing countries: that net official development assistance
should equal 0-7 per cent of GNP and that combined private and official flows
should equal 1 per cent of GNP. Britain accepts in principle the first of these but
is not committed to a timetable for reaching it. Successive governments have
made it clear that progress must depend on Britain's economic condition and
upon other calls on its resources. In 1985 net official development assistance
amounted to £1,181 million, 0-34 per cent of GNP, close to the total 0-35 per
cent for donor countries belonging to the Development Assistance Committee of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Total net
financial flows from Britain to developing countries amounted to £2,833
million, 0-81 per cent of GNP.
Britain's aid programme began as part of the discharge of its responsibilities
towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains on the
Commonwealth, which includes among its members some of the world’s poorest
countries. In 1985, £822 million of gross public expenditure on overseas aid was
disbursed bilaterally. Some £443 million (65 per cent of that directly allocated to
countries) went to the Commonwealth, including £51 million to Britain's
remaining dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid programme. Aid
was disbursed regionally as follows: Africa £306 million; Asia £255 million; the
Americas and the Caribbean £70 million; Oceania £22 million; and Europe £34
million. (A further £134 million was not allocable by region.)
The country receiving the largest amount (£106 million) was India. Other
major recipients included Sudan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Indonesia, Ethiopia,
Zambia and Zimbabwe. In line with the policy of concentrating aid on the
poorest countries, £419 million of gross bilateral aid went to the poorest 50
developing countries (excluding states with a population under 100,000 and
dependencies).
Gross bilateral financial aid in 1985 totalled £508 million. Aid for individual
projects totalled £357 million, the principal sectors supported being agriculture,
fisheries and forestry (£76 million), manufacturing (£10 million), energy (£30
million), mining (£13 million), transport and communications (£26 million) and
social and community services (£21 million). Non-project aid totalled £150
million, of which £49 million was for import financing, £28 million for food aid,
£31 million for debt relief, £10 million for budgetary support and £33 million for
disaster relief (some of these funds are channelled through the Overseas
Development Administration’s Disaster Unit which provides immediate assist¬
ance in disaster relief operations). About 77 per cent of financial aid was
provided in grants and the rest in concessionary loans. Since 1975, development
aid to the poorest countries (which include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and
many countries in Africa) has been on grant terms. In October 1984 these terms
were extended to the majority of recipients of British financial aid, and
simplified loan terms were introduced for those countries still not qualifying for
grants. Britain has more than fulfilled the 1978 resolution of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development on easing the terms of financial aid.
Britain has concluded agreements to remove the burden of past aid loans worth
about £1,000 million from 21 of the poorest countries, including India.
Financial aid is normally tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain (51 per cent in 1985), although there maybe a substantial
element for local costs and foreign content in contracts financed from tied aid in
appropriate cases. New loan but not grant commitments can be untied, if the
recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased either from the
poorest developing countries or from Britain.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
91
Technical
Co-operation
Grants totalling £42 million were provided to 18 countries in 1985 under the
Aid and Trade Provision, which is designed to match the mixed credit practices
of other donors by providing aid in combination with export credits to support
sound development projects which offer commercial opportunities to British
exporters. In November 1985, the Government introduced a new soft loan
facility under the Provision in order to respond to the preferences of certain
developing countries and to counter the practices of competitors. Increased
unds are being made available to enable British companies to double by
1988-89 the business won annually with the Provision. As a matter of general
policy, however, the Government would like to see a reduction in the use of
mixed credit by all exporting nations in the interests of more open competition
and freer trade.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation is empowered to invest in
Commonwealth countries which have achieved independence since 1948, the
remaining British dependencies and certain non-Commonwealth countries. Its
aim is to assist in the development of these countries’ economies. By the end of
1985, the Corporation had invested some £640 million out of a total
commitment of £907-7 million. Of this total, £437-1 million was in Africa,
o mi!!10n in Asia’ £128'9 million in the Caribbean and Latin America and
£102-9 million in the Pacific Islands. Commitments approved in 1985 totalled
over £106 million, of which 72 per cent was allocated to agriculture, fisheries
and forestry.
Technical co-operation, the transfer of specialised knowledge and skills from
country to country, complements finaneial aid. expertise often being essential to
the success of a programme of financial aid or investment. Expenditure on it has
increased in recent years and was £278 million, 34 per cent of gross bilateral
aid in 1985. This included £64 million for the provision of expert personnel
including volunteers, £62 million for students and trainees in Britain and
overseas, £18 million for research services and projects, £30 million for
suppHer^ SerViCeS’ and ^ milli°n f°r ^ prOViSi°n of equipment and
At the end of 1985 there were 1,974 people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers! working in developing countries, of whom 856 were engaged in the
held of education, 325 in agriculture and allied fields, and 151 in health
services. In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme there were 1,157
volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in developing
countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies (Catholic Institute for Interna-
tional Relations, International Voluntary Service, United Nations Association
n ernational Service and Voluntary Service Overseas), the bulk of their costs
being met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Some 12,150 were financed in 1985 under regional programmes of
COD°peratl°^ ^ awards under ^e Commonwealth Scholarship and
ws ip an, and under British Council schemes. In early 1983 the
Government decided to make an additional £46 million available (some outside
the md programme) over the next three years for the support of overseas
students. A new scheme for students from Commonwealth developing countries
was introduced in 1986 (see p 81). S

British Geological Survey, the Overseas Surveys Directorate of the Ordnance

information, advice and experts for service overseas, and undertake field and
laboratory research investigations.
To ensure the most effective use of aid resources, the objectives and content of
country aid programmes are determined through a systematic programming
exercise which takes account of the circumstances of the recipient country, its
development priorities, the activities of other donors, and what Britain can offer
by way of expertise, goods and services. In addition, individual projects are
carefully appraised before approval, monitored during progress against quantifi¬
able targets and assessed in a project completion report, while a programme of
special evaluation studies examines in more detail, the achievements of
particular projects and of special issues. The Overseas Development Administra¬
tion also supports international studies of aid effectiveness.
Britain is a major subscriber to the World Bank group of institutions—the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation. The
resources of the IDA, which provides interest-free loans to developing countries
unable to service loans on conventional terms, are replenished at roughly
three-year intervals. The British commitment to its Seventh Replenishment
(July 1984 to June 1987) is £401-5 million towards a total of $9,000 million.
Negotiations for the Eighth Replenishment began in January 1986. Britain
contributes to the resources of the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Develop¬
ment Bank. Its contribution to the United Nations Development Programme for
1985 was £21 million, and it is the largest source of expertise and the second
largest of fellowships and equipment provided under the Programme. There is
also a major British contribution to other UN agencies and programmes, and an
increasing proportion of British aid is now channelled through the European
Community's aid programme. Britain's commitment to the sixth European
Development Fund established by the third Lome Convention, covering the
period from 1985 to 1989, is over £800 million at present exchange rates.
Voluntary agencies provided an estimated £140 million for work in developing
countries in 1985, mainly on agriculture, health and nutrition, education
projects, and emergency relief operations.
There are about 200 agencies in all, including church and missionary
societies; among the best known are Oxfam, Christian Aid, War on Want, the
Save the Children Fund, the British Red Cross Society and the Catholic Fund for
Overseas Development. The funds are raised largely through regular donations
and collections, legacies and trading activities and, particularly in response to
specific emergencies, through appeals in the media. The Government co¬
operates with the agencies in various ways, especially in immediate post¬
disaster relief and rehabilitation operations and through its Joint Funding
Scheme. Under this it meets half the cost of selected development projects
undertaken by the agencies and aimed at helping the poorest. Such projects
include community health, non-formal education, the improvement of food
supplies, agricultural training, water supply and irrigation. Expenditure on the
Scheme in 1985 was some £4-8 million.
Voluntary agencies’ work on behalf of refugees overseas also receives official
support.

THE
INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMY
Britain favours the continuing evolution of the existing world economic system
with its free flow of trade and capital, and has defended the independence of
efficient international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As constituted
these institutions serve the vital interests of all nations and their work reflects
the growing interdependence of developed and developing countries.
Britain also supports the important role of the International Monetary Fund in
providing financial assistance, the level of which has recently been substantially
increased, to help developing countries to carry out adjustment measures to
overcome balance of payments difficulties.
The British Government recognises that the interests of developing and
industrialised countries are mutual and that all will benefit if the problems of
the world economy can be effectively tackled. Despite the recession Britain seeks
to defend the open trading system. Although domestic priorities have obliged
the Government to adopt restrictive measures in certain highly sensitive areas,
it is conscious of their exceptional character. Moreover, as a member of the
European Community, Britain has played a significant role in determining the
nature of its trade arrangements, which are among the most liberal applied by
industrialised nations. It took a major part in the negotiations on successive
Lome Conventions, both to safeguard the trading interests of Commonwealth
developing countries and to ensure that reciprocal preferences would not be
demanded from the developing countries. In addition, Britain has supported
improvements to the Community's Generalised System of Preferences scheme,
especially with regard to more liberal access into the Community for imports of
manufactured and processed agricultural products and in its application to the
poorest developed countries, particularly those in south Asia. Before entering
the Community, Britain secured a commitment to expand and reinforce
Community trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia, and this
has led to the conclusion of commercial co-operation agreements with India, Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh. Britain remains committed to the objectives of the 1973
Tokyo Declaration, namely the further liberalisation of world trade through the
progressive dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and within this, the
provision of special and more favourable treatment for the developing countries
where possible.
Britain has long recognised the importance of commodities to the economies
of many developing countries and played a full part, in company with other
European Community member states, in negotiating the commodities agree¬
ments called for by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in
resolution establishing the Integrated Programme for Commodities
(IPG). It is a member of agreements covering rubber, cocoa and coffee, the
purpose of which is to stabilise prices and supplies at levels just and
remunerative to producers and equitable to consumers. It is also a member of an
agreement for jute, largely concerned with research and development and a
similar agreement for tropical timber. Neither contains any economic provi¬
sions. As a member of the Community, Britain belongs to agreements covering
wheat and olive oil designed to improve market conditions by consultations
between producers and consumers, and the Community is a member of a purely
administrative agreement for sugar. Britain ratified the Common Fund for
Commodities, another element of the IPC, in 1981, and has agreed to contribute
o the voluntary as well as to the obligatoiy part of its work. A substantial British
contribution is made to the STABEX scheme operated by the Community which
compensates commodity-producing Lome Convention countries for shortfalls in
commodity revenue.
4 Defence
Organisation
and
Management
The primary objectives of Britain's defence policy are to ensure the country's
security, to preserve peace with freedom, and to enable it to pursue, by just and
peaceful means, its legitimate interests both at home and abroad. Britain’s
policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a defensive
alliance whose collective strength provides each of its members with far greater
security than any could achieve alone. Britain is fully committed to NATO and its
strategy ol deterrence and, in assigning directly or indirectly to NATO the vast
majority of its lorces and 95 per cent of its defence budget, makes a major
contribution to the Alliance's deterrent capabilities. It also plays a full part in the
Alliance s efforts, complementary to its defence preparations, to negotiate
balanced and verifiable arms control agreements and to reduce tension so as to
achieve a more just and lasting peace in Europe.
The defence budget for 1986-87 is nearly £18,500 million. In 1985 Britain’s
delence expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product was an estimated
5-2 per cent, the highest in NATO after the United States and Greece, and, in
absolute terms, larger than that of any other European NATO nation.
Within the budget, resources have been switched from manpower to
equipment (Britain spends a higher proportion of its defence budget—some 45
per cent—on equipment than any other NATO country); manpower is being used
with increased effectiveness, particularly by diverting personnel from non-
operational support to Iront-line tasks; and measures are in hand to improve
efficiency and value for money, especially through increased competition in the
purchase of equipment.
Britain's defence programme is designed to ensure the most effective use of
these resources in pursuit of its commitment to Western security, the main
threat to which is posed by the nuclear and conventional forces of the Warsaw
Pact. In recent years the structure and balance of the defence forces have been
improved to increase their combat effectiveness and so enhance Britain’s
contribution to NATO. As a result of these improvements Britain also has the
flexibility, as shown in the 1982 Falklands crisis, to respond quickly and
effectively to challenges to its interests outside the NATO area.
The Ministry of Defence has been reorganised to improve policy formulation and
to tighten control over the defence budget, while devolving responsibility for
day-to-day management to the Services and the Procurement Executive.
The new structure contains a unified military/civilian Defence Staff respon¬
sible for defence policy and strategy, operational requirements and commit¬
ments; it reports to the Chief of Defence Staff and the Permanent Under¬
secretary through a Vice-Chief of Defence Staff. An Office of Management and
Budget reporting to a Permanent Under-Secretary is concerned with budgetary
control and resource management. Each Service Chief of Staff reports through
the Chief of Defence Staff to the Secretary of State on matters related to the
ighting effectiveness, management, efficiency and morale of his Service The
management of the three Services is exercised through executive committees of
the Service Boards, which are chaired by their respective Chiefs of Staff, and act
in accordance with centrally determined policy objectives and budgets. The

Procurement Executive is headed by the Chief of Defence Procurement and a
new post of Chief of Defence Equipment Collaboration has been established to
promote collaborative procurement with allies and friendly nations.
A management information system has been introduced which enables
ministers and senior management to scrutinise the activities, costs and
efficiency of all areas of the Ministry. Increased awareness of the need to manage
resources cost-effectively is being promoted, with managers becoming more
accountable for the resources allocated.
NATO's security policy is based on deterrence and defence, its aims being to
prevent war or, should aggression occur, to respond at the right level to make
the aggressor quickly cease his attack and withdraw. This strategy, called
flexible response, is based on three key principles: a manifest determination to
act jointly and to defend the Treaty area against all forms of aggression: a
recognisable capability to respond effectively at all levels of aggression, and to
escalate, if necessary, in order to convince the Warsaw Pact of NATO s resolve:
and a flexibility that prevents the Soviet Union from predicting with confidence
NATO’s specific response to aggression but which would leave it in no doubt of
the grave risk it would run in resorting to the use or the threat of force against
the Alliance. These principles in turn are built on a combination of political will
and military capacity. The latter comprises the following elements, which must
be both visible and credible: adequate conventional forces deployed well forward
to deter any Soviet non-nuclear attack; theatre nuclear forces to enhance
deterrence by providing a link between conventional and strategic nuclear
forces, and deterring the use of similar weapons by the other side: and strategic
nuclear forces to provide the ultimate deterrent by having the ability to inflict
unacceptable damage against a potential enemy, even after suffering a
pre-emptive first strike.
In order to maintain the Alliance’s defence and deterrent capacity, NATO
members have agreed, among other things, to improve their conventional
defences, including a doubling of funds for infrastructure projects such as
airfield and port facilities and communications systems, an increase in
ammunition stocks and the continued exploitation of new technology (including
the co-ordination of research and procurement). NATO’s intermediate-range
nuclear forces are also being modernised. Britain is actively involved in these
measures, and is also updating its own strategic nuclear capability.
The NATO allies have acknowledged the continuing Soviet threat to Western
interests outside the NATO area and recognised the need, in the last resort, for
those members with the means to do so to take action in consultation with their
allies. At the same time, the NATO allies recognise the right of regional countries
to self-determination and, as far as possible, to defend themselves. In the
Government’s view, these principles can best be satisfied through the provision
of military assistance, including training courses in Britain, the loan of British
Service personnel and the sale of defence equipment. Britain's commitment to
these principles is also demonstrated by periodic deployments, exercises and the
maintenance of a capability to intervene militarily in the last resort.
Britain’s contribution to NATO is concentrated in areas where it can best help to
maintain Alliance security, principally NATO’s strategic nuclear deterrent and
the defence of the Central Region of Europe, the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, and the British ‘home’ base and its immediate approaches.
Britain's strategic forces, now equipped with improved Polaris missiles (to be
replaced by a Trident force in the 1990s) represent an essential European
element in NATO’s deterrent strategy, by providing a second and independent
centre of decision-making within the Alliance and an important insurance

Europe and

against any Warsaw Pact misconception that the United States would not be
prepared to use its nuclear forces in Europe’s defence. Britain has also
committed its other nuclear systems to NATO, and is continuing to provide
bases for ground-launched cruise missiles which, with Pershing II missiles, the
United States began deploying in Europe from December 1983 in order to
modernise NATO’s intermediate-range nuclear forces.
Britain's decision to update its strategic deterrent has led to increased calls
from some groups within the country for unilateral nuclear disarmament, both
on the grounds of cost and as an example to others. While the Government
understands the widespread concern regarding nuclear war, it believes such
apprehensions to be misplaced so long as the policy of deterrence and efforts to
relax East-West tensions, including the pursuit of arms control, which have
helped to maintain peace in Europe for more than 40 years, are continued. It
also believes that unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain would not
significantly alter the views on arms control of other states which possess, or
may think of acquiring, nuclear weapons, and that such action would weaken
NATO’s ability to deter aggression in the face of the continuing Soviet nuclear
and conventional threat.
Virtually all of the Royal Navy, the largest navy among the European NATO
partners, is earmarked for assignment to the Alliance and permanent contribu¬
tions are made to NATO’s two standing naval forces, in the Atlantic and the
Channel, and to its Mediterranean force when activated. The British Army of the
Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF) Germany are stationed in the Federal
Republic of Germany. BAOR's combat element consists of three strong divisions,
with supporting artillery; two divisions comprise three armoured brigades each
and a third is made up of an armoured brigade, an air-mobile brigade and an
infantry brigade (the latter being located in Britain in peacetime). A reinforcing
division, comprising one regular and two Territorial Army brigades, is also
located in Britain. On mobilisation, BAOR’s peacetime strength of around
55,000 would be almost trebled by rapid reinforcement from Britain. Nearly all
the RAF's combat and support aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany's 14
squadrons (two of helicopters) are equipped for strike/attack, reconnaissance,
close support, air defence and air transport roles, while RAF Strike Command,
which is based in Britain, provides forces for these and for the maritime patrol
and anti-submarine warfare roles.
Britain also provides important elements of NATO's specialist reinforcement
forces, including shipping and marine commando units forming the bulk of a
British-Netherlands amphibious force, ground and air units for the Allied
Command Europe Mobile Force, and several squadrons for NATO’s Strategic Air
Reserve.
Forces from all three Services are stationed at Gibraltar, which, positioned at
the western entry to the Mediterranean, is an important base for NATO.
Britain’s contribution to NATO is part of the wider effort which the European
allies make to the defence of the West, including the protection of their common
interests outside the NATO area. Since the security of each NATO member is
inextricably linked to that of the others, substantial European forces are
essential to the defence of the North American continent. There is no substitute
for the United States nuclear guarantee nor for North American forces stationed
in Europe in peacetime; but, of NATO’s ready forces in Europe, the European
allies provide about 90 per cent of the manpower, 80 per cent of combat aircraft,
85 per cent of tanks and 95 per cent of artillery, as well as 70 per cent of the
fighting ships in European and Atlantic waters. They also provide some 7
million men and women on active and reserve duties and are able to supply
around 900 military facilities for United States forces and essential support

requirements such as communications and transport. European members of
the Alliance have on average increased their defence expenditure by 27 per cent
in real terms between 1971 and 1983.
Britain and its European allies recognise the value of co-operation and
collaboration by playing a full part in the Independent European Programme
Group, a body committed to promoting intra-European arms collaboration and
to facilitating a more balanced trade in armaments between Western Europe and
North America, and in the Conference of National Armament Directors, the
forum for defence equipment collaboration across the Atlantic. They also work
together in the Eurogroup, formed following a British initiative in 1968, to
improve the effectiveness of their contributions to the Alliance and to achieve
better use of available resources through closer co-ordination. In addition, the
Western European Union, which was created by the modified Brussels Treaty of
1954, was reactivated in 1984 to provide further impetus towards European
security co-operation. The Treaty, which was signed by Belgium, Britain, the
Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands,
also enshrines Britain's commitment to the stationing of British ground and air
forces in the Federal Republic of Germany.
In support of other defence commitments, and with a view to playing a part in
collective responses by the West to threats to its world-wide interests, Britain is
maintaining and improving its ability to operate outside the NATO area without
diminishing its central commitment to the Alliance. It has an airborne brigade
which can move large numbers of men and their equipment to trouble spots
should the need arise. British garrisons are maintained in Belize, Brunei,
Cyprus, the Falkland Islands and Hong Kong. Britain also provides the largest
national troop contingent to the United Nations Force in Cyprus as well as giving
support for the United Nations Force in Lebanon. In addition it contributes a
headquarters detachment to the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai.
Considerable effort is devoted to the provision of military assistance and
training to a large number of friendly countries outside the NATO area, and
Britain deploys its forces on visits and exercises in important areas.
Army units continue to provide support to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in its
fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland. It has, however, been possible to
reduce their numbers in recent years as the police have enhanced their
capability for maintaining law and order in the face of the threat. Much of the
Army’s support to the police is provided by the Ulster Defence Regiment,
comprising both full- and part-time members who are recruited locally.
The total strength of the armed forces, all volunteers, was 323,500 on 1 January
1986 68,200 in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, 162,100 in the Army
and 93,100 in the Royal Air Force. The Ministry of Defence employs about
171,500 civilians (based in the United Kingdom).
The three women’s Services, with a combined strength of 16,000, are integral
parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in
Britain and overseas, mainly in support roles.
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks range from 3 to 22 years, with a
wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service. Subject to a minimum
period of service (varying from three to nine years, excluding training), entrants
may leave at any time, at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may also be granted on
compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience. Commis¬
sions, either by promotion from the ranks or by direct entry based on
educational and other qualifications, are granted for short, medium and long

terms. All three Services have schemes for school, university and college
sponsorships.
Non-commissioned personnel receive basic training supplemented by further
and specialist training throughout their careers. Study for educational quali¬
fications is encouraged and Service trade and technical training, highly valued
by industry, leads to nationally recognised qualifications for large numbers of
Service personnel.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia Royal Naval
College, Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air
Force College, Cranwell. This is followed by specialist training, often including
degree courses at university or Service establishments. Higher training for
officers is provided by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Army Staff College
at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell. Selected senior
officers and civilian officials from Britain and other countries attend the Joint
Services Defence College, Greenwich, and the Royal College of Defence Studies,
London, which provides the wider background necessary for those destined to
fill higher appointments.
Operational training includes joint-Service and inter-allied exercises. Train-
ing is provided for the armed forces of allied. Commonwealth and other
countries.
Reserve Forces Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. In addition
to supplementing the regular forces on mobilisation with trained personnel able
immediately to take their places either as formed units or as individual
reinforcements, they form an important link between the Services and the civil
community. Some members of these forces have a reserve liability following a
period of regular service (regular reserve); others are volunteers who train in
their spare time. Volunteer reserve forces include the Territorial Army, whose
role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to NATO and help to maintain a
secure home base in the United Kingdom; its strength is being increased to
86,000 over the remainder of the decade. Since 1985, a Home Service Force,
linked to the Territorial Army and with an initial strength of about 5,000, has
been established to assist in guarding important civilian and military installa¬
tions on mobilisation. Other volunteer forces include the Royal Naval Reserve,
the Royal Marines Reserve, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Volunteer Reserve. All have been expanded substantially in recent years or are
planned to increase in strength in the near future. The Ulster Defence Regiment,
with locally recruited and mostly part-time members, supports the police and
the Army in Northern Ireland. On 1 January 1986 regular reserves totalled
209,700, and volunteer reserves and auxiliary forces 93,100. Cadet forces,
which make a significant contribution to recruitment to the regular forces
totalled 144,700.

Nuclear Forces
The Royal Navy 's Polaris force comprises four nuclear submarines, each of which
can remain on underwater patrol for long periods and is capable of carrying 16
nuclear-armed Polaris missiles. The missile system, now incorporating improve¬
ments designed to penetrate anti-ballistic missile defences, will maintain the
force's effectiveness until it is replaced in the mid-1990s by a Trident nuclear
submarine force which will extend Britain's nuclear deterrent into the twenty-
first century. The Trident programme, which will cost an estimated £9,869
million (at 1985-86 prices), is expected to account on average for about 3 per
cent of the planned defence budget over the period of its procurement, and for
about 6 per cent of the equipment budget.

Britain's naval forces, while capable of operating throughout the world when
required, are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English Channel where
they constitute the majority of forces immediately available to NATO. They
include three new Invincible-class anti-submarine warfare carriers, carrying Sea
King anti-submarine and airborne early warning helicopters, Sea Harrier
aircraft, and Sea Dart defence missile systems; 14 nuclear-powered attack
submarines (with another four under construction or on order) equipped with
torpedoes and the Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missile, and 13 diesel-powered
submarines, soon to be replaced by the more powerful Upholder class; and about
50 destroyers and frigates for air defence, anti-submarine and general purpose
duties. Most of these have weapon-carrying helicopters (the Lynx, Wasp or
Wessex), and armaments installed include the Exocet surface-to-surface, Sea
Wolf point air defence. Sea Dart area air defence and Sea Skua anti-ship missile
systems, and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapons sfystem. There is also an
amphibious capability comprising two assault ships. Fearless and Intrepid,
supporting vessels and the Royal Marines. Other ships include about 40 mine
counter-measures vessels, including 11 of the new Hunt and 12 of the River
classes, and offshore patrol vessels for protecting fishing interests and oil and
gas installations.
In coming years Britain’s contribution to NATO’s maritime defence will be
based increasingly on an enhanced anti-submarine warfare element made up
principally of nuclear-powered attack submarines and advanced diesel-electric
conventional submarines, of which four have been ordered, one being under
construction; a newly designed Type 23 frigate, the first of which will enter
service at the end of the decade; and Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft equipped
with Searchwater radar and armed with Harpoon anti-ship missiles and
Sting Ray anti-submarine torpedoes. In addition, the surface fleet is being
strengthened by the building of 14 multi-role Type 22 frigates; seven of these are
already in service and the other seven are being constructed. New or improved
weapons will include the Harpoon missile for the last of the Type 22 and for the
new Type 23 frigates, the Spearfish heavyweight torpedo for submarines, the
Sea Eagle anti-ship missile, and the development of the vertically launched Sea
Wolf point-defence missiles and improvements to the Sea Dart surface-to-air
missiles.
Most of the Army’s combat forces, consisting of BAOR and the forces stationed
in Britain, have primary roles in support of NATO. Others are stationed overseas
in support of treaty commitments.
All three armoured divisions in BAOR are equipped with the Chieftain or
Challenger main battle tanks. The Challenger, fitted with Chobham armour to
provide greatly improved protection, will equip, by 1990, six out of the planned
12 regiments stationed in Europe (an increase of four regiments since 1980).
The war maintenance reserve will be strengthened with some of the Chieftains
replaced in the front line by Challengers. Improvements for both tanks will be
the fitting of thermal imaging sights and new 120-mm high-pressure guns.
Tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles include Scorpion, a light tank with a
76-mm gun; Scimitar, a reconnaissance vehicle with a 30-mm cannon; and
Striker, which mounts the Swingfire long-range anti-tank missiles. The primary
tracked armoured personnel carrier for mechanised infantry is the FV432. The
continuing purchase of the Saxon (a four-wheeled armoured personnel carrier)
and the introduction later in the decade of the mechanised combat vehicle
(Warrior) will increase the mobility of infantry. The crew-portable Milan
anti-tank missile is deployed throughout BAOR (front-line and all regular and
Territorial Army reinforcing battalions) and will be joined shortly by the
man-portable light anti-tank weapon, LAW80. Lynx helicopters are fitted with

an improved TOW long-range anti-tank weapon. A 155-mm gun, the SP70, will
enter service around the turn of the decade, as will the Multiple-Launch Rocket
System. Tactical nuclear support is provided by the Lance missile and
dual-capable artillery. Integral air defence is based on the Rapier missile system,
improved tracked versions of which are being introduced, and the Blowpipe and
Javelin man-portable missiles. Important improvements in command, control
and communication systems include the PTARMIGAN secure communication
system now entering service in BAOR and a distributed data-processing system
for field commanders (WAVELL); a computer-based artillery targeting system
(BATES) is planned to enter into service by the end of the 1980s.
Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, provide Britain’s air defence, assisted by Shackleton
airborne early warning aircraft and the ground radars of the United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment system. The Tornado GR1 is replacing Jaguars in
the strike/attack role and will, in due course, replace some Jaguars in the
reconnaissance role. Harrier GR3s provide close air support to ground troops.
Nimrod aircraft form part of Britain's anti-submarine warfare capability, their
duties also involving long-range maritime patrol against surface ships, offshore
surveillance and fishery protection. Improved Buccaneers will continue to be
employed in an anti-ship role, armed with the Sea Eagle missile. Victor tankers,
together with some converted Hercules aircraft, are used for in-flight refuelling.
Tactical transport is provided by VC 10 and Hercules aircraft, medium and light
support being given by Chinook, Puma and Wessex helicopters. Sea King and
Wessex helicopters perform search and rescue duties around the British Isles.
Weapons in service include Skyflash, Sparrow, Sidewinder, Martel and Sea
Eagle missiles, and guided and cluster bombs.
The Royal Air Force is undergoing a comprehensive re-equipment programme.
Improvements to Britain’s air defences include the replacement of the Lightning
and some of the Phantom squadrons with seven squadrons of the air defence
version of the Tornado aircraft; and replacement or modernisation of the radars
and command, control and communications systems for the United Kingdom
Air Defence Ground Environment. In addition, 72 Hawk trainer aircraft have
been equipped with air-to-air missiles and cannon for local air defence. An
increased air-to-air refuelling capability is being achieved with the introduction
into service of converted VC 10s and TriStars in the tanker role. The offensive
power of the Royal Air Force has been substantially enhanced by the introduc¬
tion into service of the Tornado GR1 (of which 220 have been ordered), and the
procurement of some 80 of the new Harrier GR5, which will be delivered in 1988.
All strike/attack and offensive support aircraft will be installed with advanced
electronic warfare equipment to increase their ability to survive, and the
Tornado GR1 will cany the British JP233 airfield attack weapon, ALARM (an
all-British anti-radiation missile), and a Sky Shadow pod carrying electronic
counter-measures equipment.
Defence Procurement
Responsibility for providing the armed forces with the equipment they need lies
with the Ministry of Defence’s Procurement Executive. About 45 per cent of the
defence budget will be spent on equipment in 1986-87, making the Ministry
British industry s largest customer. The Procurement Executive works with the
Service users and industry to obtain the best long-term value over a project’s life,
from concept formulation (drawing on the research programme) through
development and production to in-Service support. Where possible, work is
placed with industry under firm-price contracts won through competition.

Research is undertaken by the Ministry’s research establishments, which have a
very wide technological capability. The Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. Around £400 million is
expected to be spent on defence research and £1,900 million on development in
1986-87. Nearly all design and development of defence equipment is carried out
by industry. The Ministry is also increasingly seeking to involve industry in the
planning of the research programme and to promote civil applications. As part of
the Government’s policy of improving the strength of Britain's science base, the
Ministry, together with the research councils, is funding a series of joint
ventures with academic institutions in areas of strategic research.
Britain is participating in the United States' Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), a
research programme, projected to last some years, that was set up in 1983 to
determine the feasibility of establishing an effective defence against ballistic
missile attack. In March 1985 the United States invited its NATO and certain
other allies to participate in the programme. Following detailed discussions
about the nature and scope of the research which might be undertaken by
British firms and institutions, Britain and the United States signed in
December 1985 a Memorandum of Understanding to promote British participa¬
tion, agreeing on a programme of information exchange, areas where British
expertise might contribute to SDI research, consultative and review mechan¬
isms, and safeguards protecting the ownership of British intellectual property
rights and technology transfer. An SDI Participation Office has been established
in the Ministry of Defence, with representatives from other government
departments, and it works in close concert with British firms and institutions.
This participation in the SDI programme is intended to enhance Britain's
research capability in areas of high technology relevant to both defence and civil
programmes, as well as providing direct economic benefits.
The need for a more efficient use of resources is well recognised by NATO
members, and Britain plays a full part in the Conference of National Armaments
Directors and in the Independent European Programme Group, both of which
have as a principal aim the encouragement of greater armaments co-operation
within the Alliance. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining a sound
national industrial base for defence procurement is recognised, and there is
close consultation between government and industry in the National Defence
Industries Council and other specialised bodies.
Successful European collaborative projects have included the Jaguar and
Tornado aircraft, the FH70 howitzer, a number of helicopters, and the Martel
missile. At present Britain is working with the Federal Republic of Germany and
Italy on a self-propelled gun (SP70), with Italy on the EH 101 helicopter, and with
France and the Federal Republic of Germany on a new generation of anti-tank
guided weapons. In addition, Britain signed an initial agreement in 1985 with
the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and Spain to design, develop and produce
a supersonic fighter aircraft ready for service by 1995. Britain and the Federal
Republic will each have a 33 per cent share of the work, Italy 21 per cent and
Spain 13 per cent.
Britain also favours increased transatlantic co-operation and is working with
the United States on an advanced Harrier aircraft and, together with other
European countries, on the Multiple Launch Rocket System and the develop¬
ment of advanced air-to-air missiles.
Equipment is manufactured in private firms and publicly owned industries. In
January 1985 the Royal Ordnance Factories, formerly part of the Ministry of
Defence, became an independent commercial organisation. Royal Ordnance pic.

Defence Sales
The Government is planning to introduce private capital into the company at the
earliest opportunity. The purpose of the change is to promote more extensive
and effective competition in the supply of defence equipment in order to obtain
greater value for money, more efficient use of resources and better innovation.
The same principles are behind the Government's intention, announced in July
1985, to introduce from 1987 commercial management to two of the Royal
Dockyards, at Devonport and Rosyth, which carry out most of the refitting and
repair of Royal Navy ships.
Sales of British defence equipment enable allies and friendly governments to
take advantage of Britain's extensive research and development programmes to
improve their own defence. The Defence Export Services Organisation of the
Ministry of Defence provides a wide range of assistance to industry in promoting
equipment and negotiating contracts with overseas customers. This includes
collecting market information, demonstrating equipment, providing expert
military advice, training and support, staging exhibitions and negotiating with
overseas governments. Government and private companies employ Internation¬
al Military Services Ltd to obtain and carry out export contracts for British
defence equipment and associated services. Britain is one of the West's top three
defence exporters. It is estimated that in 1986-87 defence exports will
constitute about 3 per cent of visible exports and sustain some 120,000 jobs.
Civil Defence
Civil defence arrangements are based on the extended and adapted use of the
peacetime resources ol government departments, local authorities, emergency
services and nationalised industries, supplemented by the efforts of voluntary
organisations and individual volunteers. Civil defence regulations introduced in
1983 require local authorities to make and keep up to date plans for a range of
essential functions in the event of war; to arrange training and exercises for civil
defence staff and volunteers; and to provide suitable emergency centres for
direction of civil defence in wartime.
Following a review of existing arrangements by the Home Office in 1980,
expenditure on civil defence has been growing steadily and reached £80 million
in 1985-86. This is being used to improve the quality and readiness of central
and local government planning; increase training opportunities arranged by the
Home Office on staff college lines at the Civil Defence College, Easingwold; help
local authorities to plan for better community involvement in civil defence; and
improve the emergency system for decentralised government control and
communications. Improvements are also being made in the communications,
equipment and administrative facilities of the United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation. This includes the civilian Royal Observer Corps,
which is organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and
strength of nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive
fall-out.
'
5 Justice and the
Law
The Law
Although the United Kingdom is a unitaiy state, England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland all have their own legal systems and law courts. There is
substantial similarity on many points, but considerable differences remain in
law, organisation and practice. In Northern Ireland procedure closely resembles
that of England and Wales but there are often differences in enacted law.
However, a large volume of modern legislation applies throughout the United
Kingdom and there is a common distinction between criminal law, concerned
with wrongful acts harmful to the community, and civil law, concerned with
individuals rights, duties and obligations towards one another.
The main sources of law are legislation, common law and European
Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament, Orders (rules and
regulations made by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament) and
by-laws made by local government or other authorities exercising powers
conferred by Parliament. Common law, the ancient law of the land deduced from
custom and interpreted in court cases by the judges, has never been precisely
defined or codified but forms the basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. European Community law is confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes precedence over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most authoritative rulings are
given by the European Court of Justice.
Certain changes to United Kingdom law have been enacted as a result of
rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in particular cases where the
domestic law was in breach of the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which the United Kingdom is a
party.
Criminal Justice
There are four distinct stages in British criminal justice: making laws which
define prohibited acts and provide for the treatment of offenders; preventing
crime and enforcing the law-largely matters for the police; determining in the
courts the guilt or innocence of people accused of crimes, and sentencing the
guilty; and dealing with convicted offenders.
Action being taken by the Government in pursuit of its general strategy for the
criminal justice system is aimed at maintaining and encouraging public
confidence in the system, achieving greater efficiency in the police service and in
courts procedures, and retaining a proper balance between the rights of the
citizen and the needs of the community as a whole.
With continuing concern in Britain, as in many other countries, over rising
crime rates, public expenditure on the law and order programme reflects the
special priority given by the Government to these services. Recent increases have
been made to cover, in particular, greater police manpower, the probation
service and extra spending on prison building. More than two-thirds of total
expenditure is initially incurred by local authorities (with the help of central
government grants), mainly on the police service.
A number of measures to strengthen the criminal justice system are being
106

Law
Crime Statistics
taken. The Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 contains powers to trace, freeze
and confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking in England and Wales and forms
an important element in the Government's strategy to combat drug misuse.
Legislation is before Parliament to update the framework of public order law by
revising and codifying the common law public order offences in England and
Wales, enabling the police to impose conditions on marches and assemblies
likely to result in serious disorder or damage, serious disruption, or the
intimidation of individuals, and by tightening the offence of incitement to racial
hatred. Further government proposals have been announced to strengthen and
modernise the powers of courts to deal with criminal offenders. These proposals,
which complement a wide range of measures already introduced to prevent,
deter, detect and punish crime, include increased maximum sentences for
certain offences, further measures to confiscate criminal assets, measures to
facilitate the prosecution of fraud, changes in the jury system, improved
arrangements for compensating victims of crime and, in the interests of
combating international crime, reform of the existing law on extradition.
The criminal law, like the law generally, is interpreted by the courts but changes
in the law are matters for Parliament. In practice most legislation affecting
criminal law is government-sponsored, but there is usually consultation
between government departments and the legal profession, the police, the
probation service (in Scotland, the social work agencies), and voluntary bodies.
Chief constables in England and Wales must supply statistics relating to
offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their areas.
Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) appears in the
annual reports of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for London)
the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements operate in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Differences in the legal systems, police recording practices and statistical
classifications in the countries of the United Kingdom make it impracticable to
analyse in detail trends in crime for the country as a whole. Nevertheless, it is
clear that, as in Western Europe generally, there has been a substantial increase
in crime since the early 1950s. However, official statistics cover only crime
recorded by the police and may thus be affected by changes in the proportion of
crimes which are undiscovered or unreported. The level of police manning and
deployment of the force may also affect recording.

Table 4 shows the rate of notifiable offences recorded by the police in 1985 in
England and Wales. These figures show a 3 per cent increase over the previous
year. However, 95 per cent of recorded crime is against property and during
1985 a 3 per cent reduction in the number of burglaries was recorded, a factor
which suggests that the Government’s crime prevention campaign is proving
effective.
The number of notifiable offences recorded by the police in England and Wales
in 1985 was 3-4 million1; 35 per cent were cleared up. The Scottish police
recorded 461,970 crimes, of which 34 per cent were cleared up.
A wide range of research into criminal and social policies is carried out by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Research is also
carried out in university departments, much of it financed by the Government.
The principal university criminological research establishment is the Institute
of Criminology at Cambridge.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides compensation to victims
of violent crimes (including violence within the family), to people hurt while
trying to arrest offenders and prevent offences and to those bereaved as a result
of violence. Compensation is assessed on the basis of common law damages and
usually takes the form of a lump-sum payment. In 1984-85, 19,771 awards were
made and the total compensation was over £35 million. Proposals have been
announced to place the scheme on a statutory basis, thus giving eligible
applicants a definite right to receive compensation.
In Northern Ireland there is separate, statutory provision in certain circum¬
stances for compensation from public funds for criminal injuries, and for
malicious damage to property including the resulting losses of profits.
There has been a rapid growth in the number of locally run victim support
schemes which offer practical help to the victims of crime on a voluntary basis.
The Government provides financial assistance, both to local schemes and to
their national association.
Legislation to protect the public against terrorism has given the authorities
certain exceptional powers for dealing with and preventing terrorist activities. It
is embodied in two Acts of Parliament which take account of the need to achieve
a proper balance between the safety of the public and the rights of the
individual. While acknowledging that the special powers make inroads into civil
liberties the Government believes that they should continue in force as long as a
substantial terrorist threat remains. Nobody can be imprisoned for political
beliefs; all prisoners, except those awaiting trial, have been found guilty in court
of criminal offences.
The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (first introduced in
1973), which is in force in Northern Ireland, provides the security forces with
special powers to search, question and arrest suspected terrorists; allows the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to proscribe terrorist organisations and
provides for certain serious offences to be tried by a judge sitting alone without a
jury, to obviate the dangers of intimidation of jurors. The Prevention of
Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (first introduced in 1974), which is
applicable throughout the United Kingdom, provides for the exclusion from
Great Britain, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom of people connected with
terrorism related to Northern Ireland affairs and for the proscription of terrorist
organisations in Great Britain. It also gives the police powers to arrest people
suspected of being involved in terrorism (whether international or relating to
Excluding ‘other criminal damage’ valued at £20 and under.

approval of the Secretary of State, for up to a further five days. Both Acts have
been subject to independent review. The Emergency Provisions Act is renewable
every six months and the Prevention of Terrorism Act annually; the latter has a
total life of five years.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can be
prosecuted for criminal offences. Procedures for handling complaints against
the police involve two independent elements: the Director of Public Prosecutions
if allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the Police Complaints Board for
Northern Ireland when complaints relate only to disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 makes it possible to try in Northern
Ireland a person accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It
also enables evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences
in the Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic. One
of the aims of the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in November 1985 between the
United Kingdom and the Irish Republic is to improve security co-operation in
combating terrorism. The accession of the Irish Government to the European
Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism early in 1986 is expected to
increase the prospects of securing extradition from the Republic of people
accused or convicted of terrorist crimes in Britain.
British police action in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common consent,
for there is only a small number of officers in relation to the population (roughly
one officer to every 400 or so people). Officers do not normally carry firearms
(their only weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police
powers.
The powers of the police in England and Wales have been modernised and
clarified by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which at the same time
has enhanced safeguards for the citizen. The Act does not generally extend to
Scotland, where separate legislation applies.
The interception of communications on behalf of the police is regulated by the
Interception of Communications Act 1985, which establishes a statutory
framework governing the interception of messages in the public telecommunica¬
tions and postal services and sets out the grounds on which certain Secretaries
of State are empowered to authorise interception. So far as the police are
concerned, these are the prevention and detection of serious crime, and, in some
instances, the protection of national security. The other ground for interception
is the safeguarding of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.
Interception outside the procedures established by the Act is a criminal offence.
Each of Britain's 52 police forces is responsible for law enforcement in its area,
but there is constant co-operation among them. In order to improve their
effectiveness, forces pay particular attention to ensuring that manpower and
other resources are used as efficiently as possible.
Outside London most counties (regions in Scotland) have their own police
forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined forces. The
policing of London is in the hands of the Metropolitan Police Force, with
headquarters at New Scotland Yard, and the City of London force. The strength
of the regular police force in Great Britain at the end of 1985 was over 132,200
(including over 11,900 policewomen); in Northern Ireland the strength of the
regular Royal Ulster Constabulary was almost 12,750, including over 4,460 full-
and part-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve. The strength
of the Metropolitan Police Force was over 26,700. It is recognised that the
composition of the police force should reflect the make-up of a multiracial
society and efforts are being made to encourage more members of the ethnic
minorities to join the forces.

Police
Authorities and

Each regular police force is maintained by a police authority. In England and
Wales, these are committees of local councillors and magistrates, and in
Scotland, they are the regional and islands councils. The police authority for the
Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary. In Northern Ireland the police
authority is appointed by the Secretary of State.
The police authority's primary duty is to provide an efficient police force for its
area. Its lunctions, some subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the
chief constable, deputy chief constable and assistant chief constables; fixing the
maximum permitted strength of the force; and providing buildings and
equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the commissioner of police and his
immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary. The police authorities are financed by central and local government.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below assistant
chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authorities on
matters of efficiency, and must submit a report every year.
Central
Authorities
Status and
Duties
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administration and operation of
the police service. They approve the appointment of chief, deputy and assistant
chief constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable in
the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on matters
relating to local policing or institute a local inquiry. They can make regulations
covering such matters as police ranks; qualifications for appointment, promo¬
tion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and
uniform. Some of these regulations are first negotiable within the Police
Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom, which has an independent chairman
and representatives of the police authorities, police staff associations and the
home departments. Matters of a non-negotiable kind and general questions are
discussed by the Police Advisory Boards.
All police forces (except the Metropolitan Police, for which the Home Secretary
is directly responsible) are subject to inspection by inspectors of constabulary
reporting to the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland or the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Inspectors maintain close touch with the
forces they inspect and have advisory functions.
A British police officer is not employed by or under the direction of the police
authority or of the Government, and may be sued or prosecuted for any wrongful
act committed in carrying out duties. Statutory procedures, normally including
an independent element, govern the way in which complaints are handled. The
establishment in 1984 of a new Police Complaints Authority, with powers to
supervise the investigation of any serious complaint against a police officer, has
substantially reformed the complaints system in England and Wales. In
Scotland, complaints against police officers involving allegations of any form of
criminal conduct are investigated by independent public prosecutors. Relations
between the police and the community have been the subject of public
discussion for a number of years. The part played by the police in recent
industrial disputes, such as the 1984-85 coal industry dispute, and disturb¬
ances in 1985 in a number of English cities, have again focused attention on the
role of the police and policing methods. It is recognised that the action of the
police in enforcing the law rests mainly on their ability to secure the consent and
support of the public. Police authorities in England and Wales and, for London,
the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, are required by law to make arrange¬
ments for obtaining the views of local people on the policing of their area and for
obtaining their co-operation in joint efforts to discourage and prevent crime,

and consultative committees now operate in most police areas. Furthermore, the
number of neighbourhood watch schemes in operation in England and Wales
reached over 14,500 in 1986 and continues to increase.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or street
patrolling (the trend is increasingly away from the car patrol and back to
‘community- policing on foot) and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal
investigation and arresting offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police
officers have to deal with social problems and may bring in other social agencies
and expert help. The main departments in all forces are the uniform
department, criminal investigation department, traffic department and special¬
ised departments, which in some forces include river or marine police, mounted
police, and dog handlers.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for
operational duties, police authorities employ nearly 39,200 civilians (including
part-time employees) in England and Wales and over 2,300 in Scotland. The
number of civilian support staff has been growing as forces secure economies by
replacing police officers with civilians where posts do not require police powers
and training. Traffic wardens (of whom there are over 4,700 in England and
Wales and about 520 in Scotland) carry out specified duties concerned with
traffic and parking. Wardens are under the control of the chief constable.
Each force has an attachment of volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without pay, acting mainly as auxiliaries to the
regular force. In Northern Ireland there is a part-time and full-time paid reserve.
Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, however, have
their own staff associations to represent their interests.
A number of common services are provided by central government departments
and by arrangements between forces. The most important are: training services;
a Forensic Science Service in England and Wales (the Metropolitan Police
maintains its own laboratory); telecommunications services which provide
police radio equipment; and central and provincial criminal records available to
all forces. Regional crime squad teams of detectives from several forces
investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one police area. The
Scottish Crime Squad assists forces in crime investigation and prevention.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropolitan
Police. The National Drugs Intelligence Unit, run from the Metropolitan Police
headquarters, assists police forces and the Customs service throughout Britain.
The services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by the Metropolitan Police and City
of London Police to investigate company frauds, are available in England and
Wales.
In all areas of police work the use of scientific aids is widespread. A national
police computer helps to rationalise records and speed up the dissemination of
information.
In England and Wales arrests may be made with and without a warrant issued
by a magistrate. The police may arrest a person without a warrant under the
arrest scheme established by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which
provides a general conditional power to arrest a person reasonably suspected of
any offence. However, a person can only be arrested under the scheme if it is
necessary in order to ensure that he (or she) can be brought before a court (for
example, because of failure to give a satisfactory address for service of a
summons or in order to prevent injury to persons or property). Furthermore, the
Act categorises certain offences as arrestable or serious arrestable and

111

Treatment and
Questioning

provides a full power of arrest without warrant in respect of them for the
protection of the public.
A code of practice on detention, treatment and questioning is one of four codes
which the Home Secretary has issued under the 1984 Act. Failure to comply
with the provisions of these codes can render a police officer liable to disciplinary
proceedings.
An arrested person has a statutory right to consult a solicitor and to ask the
police to notify a named person likely to take an interest in his or her welfare
about the arrest. Where a person has been arrested in connection with a serious
arrestable offence, but has not yet been charged, the police may delay the
exercise of these rights in the interests of the investigation if certain criteria are
met. The police must in most circumstances caution a person whom there are
grounds to suspect of an offence before any questions are put for the purpose of
obtaining evidence. Questions relating to an offence may normally not be put to
a person after he or she has been charged with that offence or informed that he
or she may be prosecuted for it.
The detention scheme in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act provides for a
person to be detained only if, and for as long as, necessary for a purpose
specified by law up to a maximum of 96 hours before charge. A person can only
be detained beyond 36 hours if a warrant is obtained from a magistrates’ court.
Reviews must be made of a person s detention (whether before or after charge)
at regular intervals to check whether the criteria for detention are still satisfied.
If they are not, the person must be released immediately.
As a practical means of developing public confidence in the treatment of
people detained by the police, the Government is encouraging the establishment
of schemes whereby lay visitors make random checks on the interrogation and
detention of suspects in police stations.
As soon as there is sufficient evidence to charge a person, the police must decide
on an appropriate method of dealing with him or her. As an alternative to
charging immediately, they could for example decide to defer charging, to deal
with the matter by summons or to take no further action and release the person
with or without bail. Where immediate charge is appropriate the person may
continue to be held in custody if the name or address furnished is considered
suspect, if there are grounds for believing that detention is necessary for his or
her own protection, to prevent harm to people or property, or if there is a risk
that the person would otherwise fail to appear in court or could interfere with
the administration of justice. When no such considerations apply, the person
must be released with or without bail depending on the circumstances of the
case. Where a person is detained after charge, there is provision in the Act for
him or her to be brought before a magistrates’ court quickly. This will usually be
no later than the following day.
It is for the court to decide, under the provisions of the Bail Act 1976, whether
an accused person in criminal proceedings should be released on bail. A court
may only withhold bail in certain specified circumstances, for instance, if the
court has substantial grounds for believing that the accused person would
abscond, commit an offence, interfere with witnesses, or otherwise obstruct the
course of justice if released on bail. A court may also impose conditions before
granting bail. If bail is refused, the defendant may apply to a High Court judge or
to the Crown Court for bail, and application can be made to the Crown Court for
conditions imposed by a magistrates' court to be varied. The majority of people
remanded by magistrates are given bail.

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
CRIMINAL
COURTS
England and
Wales
A person who thinks that the grounds for detention are unlawful1 may apply
to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained
him or her, requiring the person to appear before the court to justify the
detention. An application for this writ is normally made by the person detained
or by someone acting on his or her behalf. Similar procedures apply in Northern
Ireland. The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 established an independent
Crown Prosecution Service for England and Wales which in 1986 took over
responsibility for all criminal proceedings instituted by the police. Its measures
include the provision of statutory time limits on the period from arrest to
commencement of trial in criminal proceedings in England and Wales. Field
trials to establish the appropriate time limits are in progress.
In Scotland, the police may detain and question a suspected person for a
period of up to six hours. Thereafter the person must either be released or
charged. An arrest must be accompanied by a criminal charge. Once a person
has been charged there is little scope for questioning and only voluntary
statements will normally be allowed in evidence at the trial. The court will reject
statements unless satisfied that they have been fairly obtained. Anyone arrested
must be brought before a court with the least possible delay (generally not later
than the first day after being taken into custody), or—in less serious
cases—liberated by the police, often on a written undertaking to attend court on
a specified date. Where a prosecution on indictment is intended (that is, where
an accusation of a more serious offence is to be made), the accused is brought
before the sheriff to be committed, either for further examination or until
liberated in due course of law. A judicial examination may take place. Eight days
may elapse between commitment for further examination and commitment
until liberated in due course of law. The latter—which is also described as ‘full
committal'—is commitment for trial. No evidence needs to be presented to the
sheriff for such commitment. Anyone accused of a crime, except murder or
treason, is entitled to apply for release on bail. Money bail has been virtually
abolished and the courts, or the Lord Advocate, may release an accused person
on conditions.
Breach of any of the conditions without reasonable excuse is a separate
offence. There is a right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person
against the refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either party against the conditions imposed. The writ of habeas corpus does not
apply in Scotland but if a person is to be prosecuted on indictment and has been
kept in custody pending trial, the trial must begin within 110 days of the date of
full committal. The trial of a person charged with a summary offence and held in
custody must begin within 40 days.
The initial decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the
police and thereafter the conduct of proceedings rests with the Crown
Prosecution Service. In Scotland, public prosecutors decide whether or not to
begin proceedings. In Northern Ireland there is a Director of Public Prosecu¬
tions. In England and Wales (and exceptionally in Scotland) a private person
may institute criminal proceedings. Police may issue cautions and in Scotland
the public prosecutor may warn, instead of prosecuting.
The new Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales is headed by the
Director of Public Prosecutions under the superintendence of the Attorney
General. The Director appoints chief Crown prosecutors—for the most part

Parliament and when expressly authorised by Parliament. It is also sometimes lawful in the case

covering a police force area—who deal with the vast majority of cases in
consultation with the police, who investigate, and the courts, who hear the
cases. The Service is responsible for providing advocates to present cases in
magistrates' courts and briefs barristers to appear on its behalf in the Crown
Court. While the decision to prosecute is delegated, as far as possible, to the local
level, certain categories of cases are referrable to the Director of Public
f rosecutions; including large and complex fraud, obscene publications and
exhibitions, and allegations affecting police officers.
While much of the prosecution work at the Central Criminal Court in London
is conducted by a team of Treasury Counsel appointed by the Attorney General,
experienced barristers are also nominated from time to time to lead a member of
the Treasury team.
In Scotland the Lord Advocate is responsible for the prosecution of all suspects
but delegates most of the work to the Solicitor General (see p 128), to 12
advocates depute and to procurators fiscal. The permanent adviser to the Lord
Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown Agent, who is head of the
procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of civil servants with legal
qualifications known as the Crown Office. Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal and the Crown Office and
prosecuted by the Lord Advocate, Solicitor General and advocates depute, while
crimes tried before the sheriff and district courts are prepared and prosecuted
by the procurators fiscal, who are lawyers and full-time civil servants operating
from offices within the various sheriff court districts. The police investigate
offences and report to the procurator fiscal, who decides whether to prosecute,
subject to the directions of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible to
the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment, and may do so
in summary cases of a serious nature. Other summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Magistrates courts dispose of the bulk of criminal cases in England and Wales,
and conduct preliminary investigations into more serious offences, which go to
the Crown Court for trial. The Crown Court, situated in a number of towns and
cities, takes all criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts and trials are
held before a jury.
Magistrates courts hear and determine cases for which jury trial is not
required. There are about 700 magistrates' courts in England and Wales and
27,750 magistrates (justices of the peace’, JPs). These are made up of about 60
full-time, legally qualified stipendiary magistrates, and some 27,690 unpaid lay
magistrates. Magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor except in
Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, where appointments are made
by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Stipendiary magistrates may sit
alone and usually preside in courts in urban areas where the workload is heavy
Otherwise a court normally consists of three lay magistrates who are advised on
points of law and procedure by a legally qualified clerk who is also in charge of
the court’s administrative arrangements. When the clerk to the justices is not in
court, the magistrates are advised by a qualified assistant.
Magistrates courts try people charged with summary offences (less serious
offences that can only be disposed of by magistrates) and people charged with
‘either way’ offences where summary trial seems to the court appropriate and the
defendant agrees. Courts also conduct committal proceedings in the case of
people charged with indictable offences and with either way offences not tried bv
them. J

Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court to which the public and press are
admitted. They cannot impose a sentence of more than six months’ imprison¬
ment nor a fine exceeding £2,000. If an offence carries a higher maximum
penalty, they may commit the defendant for sentence at the Crown Court if they
consider their own power inadequate.
Cases involving people under 17 are heard in juvenile courts. These are
specially constituted magistrates’ courts which either sit apart from other
courts or are held at a different time. Only limited categories of people may be
present and press reports must not identify any juvenile appearing either as a
defendant or a witness. Where a young person under 17 is charged jointly with
someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary magistrates’ court. If the
young person is found guilty, the court may transfer the case to a juvenile court
for sentence unless satisfied that it is undesirable to do so, in which case it has
the power to impose a limited category of non-custodial sentence itself.
The Crown Court deals with trials of the more serious cases, the sentencing of
offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals from
magistrates’ courts. It sits at about 90 centres and is presided over by High
Court judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All contested
trials take place before a jury. Magistrates sit with a circuit judge or recorder to
deal with appeals and committals for sentence.
The Crown Court may impose on a convicted offender a fine either limited by
the statutory maximum, or where there is no statutory maximum, of unlimited
amount, and, within the permitted statutory maximum, any other custodial or
non-custodial penalty.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court
against the sentence imposed if he has pleaded guilty; or against the conviction
or sentence imposed if he has not pleaded guilty. Where the appeal is on a point
of law, either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’
court to the High Court (see p 124). Appeals from the Crown Court, either
against conviction or against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal
(Criminal Division). A further appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of
Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the Lords that the point is
one that ought to be considered by the House. A prosecutor or defendant may
appeal to the Lords from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his or her consent.
In Scotland the High Court of Justiciary tries such crimes as murder, treason
and rape; the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences and the
district court with minor offences. Criminal cases are heard either under solemn
procedure, when proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a
jury of 15 members, or under summary procedure, when the judge sits without a
jury. All cases in the High Court and the more serious ones in sheriff courts are
tried by a judge and jury. Summary procedure is used in the less serious cases in
the sheriff courts, and in all cases in the district courts. District courts are the
administrative responsibility of the district and the islands local government
authorities. The judges are lay justices of the peace; the local authorities may
appoint up to one-quarter of their elected members to be ex-officio justices. In
Glasgow there are four stipendiary magistrates who are full-time salaried
lawyers. Children under 16 who have committed an offence or are for other

reasons specified in statute considered to need compulsory care may be brought
before a children’s hearing comprising three members of the local community
(see p 122).
Scotland's six sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts, each
of which has one or more sheriffs, who are the judges of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary, Scotland's supreme criminal court, is both a
trial and an appeal court. Any of the following judges is entitled to try cases in
the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the Lord
Justice Clerk (the judge next in seniority) or one of the Lord Commissioners of
Justiciary. The main seat of the courts is in Edinburgh, although the High
Court on circuit also tries cases in other towns.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court in Edinburgh. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sentence,
or both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a conviction. There is
no further appeal to the House of Lords. In summary proceedings the prosecutor
may appeal on a point of law against acquittal or sentence. The Lord Advocate
may seek the opinion of the High Court on a point of law which has arisen in a
case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
The structure of Northern Ireland courts is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales. The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor cases is
carried out by magistrates' courts presided over by a full-time, legally qualified
resident magistrate. Young offenders under 17 and young people under 17 who
need care, protection and control are dealt with by juvenile courts consisting of
the resident magistrate and two lay members (at least one of whom must be a
woman) specially qualified to deal with juveniles. Appeals from magistrates'
courts are heard by the county court.
The Crown Court deals with criminal trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Proceedings are heard before a single judge, and
all contested cases, other than those involving offences specified under
emergency legislation, take place before a jury. Appeals from the Crown Court
against conviction or sentence are heard by the Northern Ireland Court of
Appeal. Procedures lor a further appeal to the House of Lords are similar to those
in England and Wales.
Criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between the
prosecution and the defence. Since the law presumes the innocence of an
accused person until guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any
advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant (in Scotland, called
an accused) has the right to employ a legal adviser and may be granted legal aid
from public funds. If remanded in custody, the person may be visited by a legal
adviser to ensure a properly prepared defence. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland during the preparation of the case, the prosecution usually tells the
defence of relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and
discloses them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also inform the defence
of witnesses whose evidence may help the accused and whom the prosecution
does not propose to call. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the
defendant's mental state renders him or her unfit to be tried. If the jury (or in
Scotland, the judge) decides that this is so, the defendant is admitted to a
specified hospital.
Criminal trials are normally in open court and rules of evidence (concerned
with the proof of facts) are rigorously applied. If evidence is improperly admitted,
a conviction can be quashed on appeal. During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution, normally

through a lawyer; to call his or her own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court in
person or through a lawyer, the defence having the right to the last speech at the
trial. The defendant cannot be questioned without consenting to be sworn as a
witness in his or her own defence. When he or she does testify, cross-
examination about character or other conduct may be made only in exceptional
circumstances; generally the prosecution may not introduce such evidence.
In jury trials the judge decides questions of law, sums up the evidence for the
jury and instructs it on the relevant law, and discharges the accused or passes
sentence. Only the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. In
England and Wales, if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may
direct it to bring in a majority verdict provided that, in the normal jury of 12
people, there are not more than two dissentients. In Scotland, where the jury
consists of 15 people, the verdict may be reached by a simple majority. However,
as a general rule, no person may be convicted without corroborated evidence. If
the jury returns a verdict of‘not guilty’ (or in Scotland ‘not proven’, which is an
alternative verdict of acquittal), the prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If ‘guilty’ the defendant
has a right of appeal to the appropriate court. A jury is completely independent
of the judiciary. Once members are sworn in, they are protected from all
interference. Both the prosecution and the defence can object to particular
jurors. People between the ages of 18 and 65 whose names appear on the
electoral register, with certain exceptions, are liable for jury service and their
names are chosen at random. (Proposals to increase the upper age limit from 65
to 70 have been announced.) Ineligible persons include the judiciary, priests,
people who have within the previous ten years been members of the legal
profession, the Lord Chancellor’s Department, or the police, prison and
probation services, and certain sufferers from mental illness. Disqualified
persons also include those sentenced to two or more years’ imprisonment and
those who have, within the previous ten years, served any part of a sentence of
imprisonment, youth custody or detention, or been subject to a community
service order, or, within the previous five years, been placed on probation.
Coroners investigate violent and unnatural deaths or sudden deaths where the
cause is unknown. Deaths may be reported to the local coroner (who is either
medically or legally qualified, or both) by doctors, the police, the registrar,
various public authorities or members of the public. If the death is sudden and
the cause unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest if, after a
post-mortem examination has been made, he or she is satisfied that the death
was due to natural causes. Where there is reason to believe that the deceased
died a violent or unnatural death or died in prison or in other specified circum¬
stances the coroner must hold an inquest and it is the duty of the coroner’s
court to establish how, when and where the deceased died. A coroner may sit
alone, or in certain circumstances, with a jury. In Scotland the office of coroner
does not exist. The local procurator fiscal inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings to the Crown Office. In a minority
of cases a fatal accident inquiry may be held before the sheriff. For certain
categories (such as deaths in custody) a fatal accident inquiry is mandatory. In
addition, the Lord Advocate has discretion to instruct an inquiry in the public
interest in cases where the circumstances give rise to public concern.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a person may be sentenced to custodial
treatment only if the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. Unless
that person has previously received a custodial sentence of the same kind, he or
she must also have been legally represented. In England and Wales, extended
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
117
Non-custodial
Treatment
sentences longer than the normal maximum term may be imposed on persistent
offenders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory penalty of life
imprisonment. This is the maximum penalty for a number of serious offences
such as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter. The death penalty has been
repealed for almost all offences (including murder and the other common
serious crimes) and it is no longer used.
In Scotland similar safeguards exist in relation to the imposition of custodial
sentences. Unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty is
determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indictment,
the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up to life,
and the sheriff court any term up to two years but may send any person to the
High Court lor sentence if the court considers its powers are insufficient. In
summary cases, the sheriff may normally impose up to three months’
imprisonment or six months’for some repeated offences, although his powers
are extended by statute in some exceptional cases. In the district court the
maximum term of imprisonment is 60 days.
The commonest sentence in courts throughout the United Kingdom is a fine
which is imposed in more than 80 per cent of cases. There is no limit to the size
of fine which may be imposed on indictment, but in summary procedure the
maximum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is £2,000. In Scotland it is
£2,000 in the sheriff court and £1,000 in the district court.
The Government s policy is to maintain and develop an effective range of
non-custodial sentences including fines, probation and absolute discharge. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the court may impose conditional
discharge when it considers there is no need to impose punishment; and
binding over where the offender pledges money, with or without sureties, to
keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
Offenders aged 16 or over (17 in Northern Ireland) convicted of imprisonable
offences may, with their consent, be given community service orders. The court
may order between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service (the maximum is 120
hours where the offender is under 17) to be completed within 12 months. (This
does not apply in Northern Ireland.) Examples of work done include decorating
the houses of old or disabled people and building adventure playgrounds. The
number of community service orders increased by 72 per cent between 1980 and
1984, in England and Wales. In Scotland the number of community service
orders made by the courts increased from 492 in 1980 to 2,533 in 1984.
Experimental schemes have been started to enable offenders to make direct
reparation to their victims, either by paying financial compensation or by
undertaking some service for them.
The sentence imposed on an offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
may also, with his or her consent, be deferred for up to six months to enable a
court to take into account conduct after some expected change in circum¬
stances. In Scotland sentence may also be deferred with or without the
offender s consent. There is no limit to the length of deferment.
The courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may order an offender to
pay compensation for personal injury, loss or damage resulting from an offence.
The Government favours the courts making full use of their compensation
powers. Proposals have been announced for further improving and strengthen¬
ing these powers, and seeking to ensure that the courts have detailed
information about the victim’s losses for consideration when sentencing the
offender. In Scotland there is also a system of compensation by offenders
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served unless the
o ender is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprisonment; in that
118

Probation
Prisons
event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another sentence may
be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a suspended sentence of
more than six months may be placed under the supervision of a probation officer
for all or part of the period. Courts in England and Wales have the power, when
passing a sentence of between three months' and two years' imprisonment, to
order that part should be served and the rest held in suspense.
In certain circumstances courts may order forfeiture of property involved in
the commission of crime (see p 106). An offender convicted of a serious crime
may be disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, after a rehabilitation period of from six months to ten
years depending on the nature of the sentence imposed, a person convicted of a
criminal offence need not disclose it, and the offence will not be held against him
or her. This does not apply to those with a prison sentence of more than 21/2
years. ‘
At present in the United Kingdom the number of offenders subject to
supervision in the community considerably exceeds the number in custody. The
purpose of probation is to protect society by the rehabilitation of the offender,
who continues to live a normal life in the community while subject to the
supervision of a probation officer. Before placing an offender on probation,
which may last from six months (12 months in Scotland) to three years, the
court must explain the order in ordinary language, ensuring that the offender
consents to the requirements of the order and understands that a failure to
comply with them will make him or her liable to a penalty or to be dealt with for
the original offence. In England and Wales such an order can be made only for
offenders aged 17 years or more. In Scotland the minimum age is 16 years and in
Northern Ireland 14 years. About 15 per cent of orders contain a variety of
additional requirements concerning place of residence, attendance at day
centres or treatment for mental illness. The probation service also administers
supervision orders, the community service scheme and parole. In addition,
social work services are provided in custodial establishments.
In England and Wales the cost of the probation service is shared between
central and local government and it is administered locally by probation
committees of magistrates and members co-opted from the local community. In
Scotland it is administered by local authority social work departments and in
Northern Ireland by a probation board, whose membership is representative of
the community and which is funded by central government.
Probation committees provide and maintain day centres and hostels together
with schemes and programmes designed to meet the needs of a broad range of
offenders, and, if possible, drawing the community into partnership in
responding to offending. In Scotland and Northern Ireland these responsibilities
are undertaken respectively by local authority social work departments and the
probation board.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation officers are
available to every court, of both criminal and civil jurisdiction. In Scotland,
officers of the local authority social work department are similarly available.
The Government aims to provide a humane, efficient and effective prison
service. The daily average inmate population in 1985 in England and Wales was
nearly 46,300 and is projected to rise to between 53,000 and 59,000 by 1994. In
Scotland the average population in custody has remained fairly steady for the
last decade at around 4,900. In 1985, however, it rose to 5,270. In Northern
Ireland the daily average inmate population in 1985 was 2,043 and is expected
to fall slightly in 1987—88.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
119
local prisons ; all are closed. Other prisons, open or closed, receive prisoners on
transfer from local prisons. (Open prisons do not have physical barriers to
prevent escape.) In England, Scotland and Wales sentenced prisoners are
classified into groups for security purposes. There are separate prisons for
women. There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland, where the majority of
offenders are serving sentences for terrorist offences. The Government has
announced measures to improve procedures for the security classification of
prisoners.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Those under 21 awaiting trial are, where possible, separated from older
prisoners.
Many of the prisons in England and Wales were built in the nineteenth
century, and are now in need of major repairs. Others are housed in converted
premises which are expensive to maintain. The Government’s aim is to match
the number of places available to the size of the prison population by the end of
the decade thereby reducing overcrowding to a minimum. In order to achieve
this and to improve the standards of existing prison establishments, a major
programme of building and refurbishment is now in progress. This includes the
construction of 16 new prisons, three of which are already complete and in use.
In Northern Ireland two new prisons—one for men and one for women—opened
in 1986.
Remission of
Sentence
Most prisoners in Great Britain are eligible for remission of one-third of their
sentence provided it does not reduce the sentence to less than five days. In
Northern Ireland the Secretary of State reviews life sentence cases in such a way
as to reflect fully their gravity and to take account of the special circumstances of
Northern Ireland. Remission may be forfeited for serious misconduct. There is
no remission for prisoners serving sentences under civil law and those serving
sentences of unspecified length (for example, the criminally insane, whose
release depends upon improvement in their mental condition).
Parole and
Life Licence
In England and Wales prisoners serving determinate sentences of more than
10-5 months become eligible for consideration for release on parole licence when
they have served one-third of the sentence, or six months, whichever expires the
later. (In Scotland they qualify after 12 months.) However, for those serving
sentences of over five years for violence or drug trafficking, parole is granted only
in exceptional circumstances, or otherwise for a few months at the end of the
sentence. The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the
prisoner would otherwise have been released from prison. It prescribes the
conditions, including the maintenance of contact with a supervising officer,
with which the offender must comply. In 1985 about 5-6 per cent of prisoners
granted parole in England and Wales, and about 6-6 per cent in Scotland, were
recalled to prison.
The release of prisoners serving life sentences is at the discretion of the Home
Secretary or in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, subject to a
favourable recommendation by the Parole Board and after consultation with the
judiciary. The Secretaries of State are not, however, bound to accept a
recommendation by the Parole Board for release, nor are they bound by the views
of the judiciary. At the discretion of the Home Secretary, people serving life
sentences for the murder of police and prison officers, terrorist murders,
murder by firearms in the course of robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least 20 years. At the end of 1985, there
were about 2,025 life sentence prisoners detained in prisons in England and
Wales of whom about 105 had been detained for over 15 years. Life sentence

prisoners are released on licence for the rest of their lives subject to recall.
Similar arrangements exist in Northern Ireland except that the recommenda¬
tions are made to the Secretary of State by an internal review body.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a sentence of more than five days are
eligible for remission of half of their sentence. A prisoner serving a sentence of
more than 12 months who is released from prison with remission is liable to be
ordered to serve the remaining balance of this sentence if convicted of fresh
imprisonable offences during this period.
Selected prisoners who are nationals of countries which have ratified the
Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons may apply
to be returned to their own country to serve the rest of their sentence there.
Prison industries aim to give inmates work experience which will assist them
when released and to secure a return which will reduce the cost of the prison
system. The main industries are clothing and textile manufacture, engineering
woodwork, laundering, electro-mechanical production, farming and horticul¬
ture. Most production caters for internal needs and for other public services but
some of it is for the commercial market. A few prisoners are employed outside
prison. Small payments are made for work; in some prisons, incentive schemes
provide an opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill.
Education is financed by the prison service and staffed by local education
authorities. In every establishment the education officer is assisted by a team of
teachers. Education is compulsory, full-time, for young offenders below
school-leaving age and, in England and Wales, part-time for those between 16
and 21. For older offenders it is voluntary. Some prisoners study for public
examinations (including those of the Open University). Within the resources
available there is a full adult education curriculum. Library facilities are
available in all establishments. Vocational training is provided directly by the
prison service. Physical education is voluntary for adult offenders but compul¬
sory for young offenders. Some 50 per cent of prisons now have purpose-built
physical education facilities while all but two of the remainder use gymnasia
converted from other buildings.
Education in Northern Ireland prisons is traditionally an evening activity, but
governors may and do permit prisoners who need help in basic education and
those preparing for public examinations to spend part of their working week on
educational pursuits. Recently, the distance-learning mode of study has been
introduced in a wide range of subjects, lessening the need for evening classes.
Prison education is provided by full-time and part-time staff. A wide range of
educational and vocational training facilities, from remedial education to Open
University level, is available.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation
for sick people and patients can also be transferred to National Health Service
hospitals. Psychiatric care is available.
The work of psychologists includes evaluating treatment programmes,
studying management practices, contributing to the management and treat¬
ment programmes of individuals and groups, taking part in advisory and
training work with staff and making assessments for treatment or allocation
purposes.
Prisoners are entitled to write and receive letters and to be visited by relatives
and friends, and those in open establishments may make telephone calls, as may
remand prisoners in certain circumstances. Privileges include a personal radio.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
121
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the opportunity to make purchases
from the canteen with money earned in prison. Depending on facilities
prisoners may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation in
association, and watching television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the boards
of visitors (visiting committees in Scotland), who have power to order forfeiture
of remission and forfeiture of privileges. Boards of visitors (and visiting
committees) consist of lay people, two of whom must be magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the concern of all prison staff. Much of this work is
the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers) stationed in
prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals and agencies
outside and play a leading part in helping prisoners to make constructive
resettlement plans before their release. Prisoners may also receive visits from
specially appointed prison visitors whose work is voluntary.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life.
All prisons in England and Wales make pre-release preparations. Prisoners
serving four years or more are considered for outside employment before release.
For those selected, work is found outside the prison for about the last six
months of sentence; during the period prisoners may live in a separate part of
the prison or in a hostel outside. Normal wages are paid so that they can resume
support for their families. (In Scotland pre-release arrangements differ from
these in some respects.) Periods of home leave may be granted to those serving
medium- or longer-term sentences to help them maintain family ties and to
assist them with their resettlement. In Northern Ireland arrangements exist for
prisoners serving fixed sentences to have short periods of leave near the end of
their sentences and at Christmas.
The aim of after-care, run by the probation service (in Scotland, the local
authority social services departments), is to assist offenders on return to society.
Compulsory supervision is given to most offenders under 21 when released,
adult offenders released on parole, and those released on licence from a life
sentence. A voluntary system is offered to others. Assistance is also provided by
voluntary societies, some of which are affiliated to the National Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. There is also a Scottish Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and accommodation may be
provided, often with government financial help. The Northern Ireland Associa¬
tion for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, also a voluntary group, is
mainly concerned with assisting petty criminals and alcoholics towards
rehabilitation and social awareness.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be found guilty of an offence.
A child aged ten but under 17 who is alleged to have committed an offence may
be brought before a court in either criminal or care proceedings. The court in
criminal proceedings is usually, and in care proceedings is always, a juvenile
court. Before an order may be made in care proceedings, it must be shown not
only that the child has committed the offence, but also that he or she is in need
of care or control which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the order is made;
this further condition must also be satisfied where a court makes a care order in
criminal proceedings. A number of orders are common to both care and criminal
proceedings: in either the court may make a care order or a supervision order or,
if the child s parents consent, an order requiring them to agree to exercise
proper care and control over the child; it may also make an order under the
mental health legislation.
122
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland
Under a care order a local authority becomes responsible for deciding where
the child should be accommodated. It may allow him (or her) to remain at home
under supervision or place him or her with foster parents or in a voluntary or
community home. For children too severely disturbed or disruptive to be treated
in local authority homes, there are two special Youth Treatment Centres run by
the Department of Health and Social Security. The authority must review each
care order every six months and consider whether an application should be
made to the court to end it; the order normally expires when the child reaches 18
or 19. When a child who is already under a care order as a result of an offence
commits a further offence (for which an adult could be punished by imprison¬
ment) a court may attach a charge and control condition to the order. This
suspends for up to six months the local authority’s discretion to place the child
in his or her own home, but does not oblige the authority to place the child in a
community home. The local authority may, for example, place the child with
foster parents.
Under a supervision order (which may remain in force for not more than three
years) a child normally lives at home under the supervision of a social worker or
a probation officer, though the court may require him or her to live with a
specified person. The court has power to require that the child comply with
directions given by his or her supervisor or, in criminal proceedings, with
requirements made by the court itself. By either of these means, the supervision
order can be used to provide for a programme of ‘intermediate treatment',
consisting of participation, under a supervisor, in a variety of constructive and
remedial activities through a short residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre.
In criminal proceedings, the courts may order payment of compensation, or
impose a fine or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. Payment of fines,
compensation or costs incurred by juvenile offenders is normally the responsi¬
bility of their parents or guardians. Offenders, both boys and girls, may be
ordered to spend a total of up to 24 hours of their Saturday leisure time (up to
three hours on any one occasion) at an attendance centre. The centres, which
provide physical education and instruction in practical subjects, are for those
found guilty of offences for which older people could be sent to prison. Offenders
aged 16 may be ordered to perform up to 120 hours of community service. Boys
aged 14 to 16, for whom a non-custodial penalty would not be appropriate, may
be sent to a junior detention centre for a term of three weeks to four months. The
regime is similar to that in senior detention centres (see p 123). Youth custody,
usually for periods in excess of four months, is available for boys and girls aged
15 or 16. The maximum sentence is 12 months. In the case of a very serious
crime, detention in a place approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered, and
must be ordered in the case of homicide.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children under the age of 16 years in court is rare and can take place only as
instructed by the Lord Advocate; court proceedings normally take place only
where the offence is of a serious nature, or where a child is prosecuted together
with an adult. Instead, children under 16 (or in certain circumstances those
aged between 16 and 18 if subject to a supervision requirement) who have
committed an offence or are considered to be in need of care and protection may
be brought before a children’s hearing. The hearing, which consists of three lay
people drawn from a panel for each region or islands area, determines in an
informal setting whether compulsory measures of care are required and, if so,
the form they should take. An official ‘reporter’ decides whether a child should
come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are not accepted by the child or
parents, or if for any reason the child is not capable of understanding the

explanation of the grounds, the case goes to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the case to the reporter to arrange a
hearing. The sheriff also decides appeals against any decision of a children’s
hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children under the
age of 17 charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought before a
juvenile court. If the child is found guilty of an offence punishable by
imprisonment when committed by an adult, he or she may be sent to a training
school, placed in the care of a ‘fit person’, possibly the area health and social
services board, or put under supervision. Alternatively the court can order a
period at an attendance centre or a remand home, or impose a fin^ or
compensation. A conditional or absolute discharge is also possible. Whatever
other order it makes, a juvenile court can also make an order requiring parents
to ensure the child’s good behaviour. Children brought before the courts in need
of care and protection may be placed in care locally.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years (16 to 21 years in Scotland) form a separate
category from juvenile and adult offenders. In England and Wales, the penalties
for young adults are fines and compensation, attendance centre orders and
probation orders; offenders may also be sentenced to up to 240 hours of
community service. As in the case of juvenile offenders, a custodial sentence may
be imposed only when no other measure would be appropriate. The custodial
sentences for offenders of this age are the detention centre order (for young men
sentenced to a term of four months or less) and the youth custody sentence (for
both sexes). For the most serious offences young adults may be sentenced to
custody for life. Detention centres, which receive offenders directly from the
courts, operate a consistent regime which is geared to the short sentences
involved. This inculcates a high standard of discipline and effort; in senior
centres it includes a full working week; younger offenders receive at least 15
hours of education a week. Both junior and senior centres provide one hour of
physical training each day. The youth custody centre regime is designed for
offenders who are usually serving a minimum sentence of over four months, and
for those allocated from a local prison. The aim is to provide flexible but coherent
programmes of activities which are as constructive as possible and can include
an element of vocational training. Some young offenders sentenced to youth
custody are held in local prisons and remand centres in special accommodation
where as full a regime as possible is provided. Young offenders are eligible for
parole on the same terms as adults and all are supervised after release.
In Scotland young offenders sentenced to detention serve their sentences
either in a detention centre (in the case of males only) or a young offenders’
institution, depending on the length of the sentence. Remission of part of the
sentence for good conduct, release on parole, and supervision after release are
available. In Northern Ireland, offenders aged between 17 and 21 who are
sentenced to three years or less may be sent to a young offenders' centre.
Civil Justice
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including concepts such as negligence,
defamation and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional
and administrative (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
124

Wales
Appeals
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its own, often
analogous, branches.
An inquiry into the system of civil justice in England and Wales was set up in
early 1985. Its aim is to improve the machinery of civil justice through reforms
in jurisdiction, procedure and court administration, and in particular to reduce
delay, cost and complexity.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affilia¬
tion and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction regarding
nuisances under the public health legislation and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers actions founded upon
contract and tort (with minor exceptions); trust and mortgage cases; and
actions for the recovery of land. Cases involving claims exceeding set limits may
be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or in certain
circumstances on transfer from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the Rent
Acts, landlord and tenant, and adoption cases. Divorce cases are determined in
those courts designated as divorce county courts and outside London bankrupt¬
cies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also deal with complaints
of race and sex discrimination. Where small claims are concerned (especially
those involving consumers), there are special arbitration facilities and simpli¬
fied procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the Crown
Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have power to sit
in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges assigned to it
by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are mostly taken by
them. The judge normally sits alone, although on request the court may,
exceptionally, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction is both original and
appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases. In general, particular
types of work are assigned to a particular division. The Family Division, for
instance, is concerned with all jurisdiction affecting the family, including that
relating to adoption and guardianship. The Chancery Division deals with the
interpretation of wills and the administration of estates. Maritime and
commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial courts of the
Queen’s Bench Division. A consultative paper examining the issues involved in
setting up a unified jurisdiction in family and domestic matters—a single family
court’—was published in mid-1986.
Each of the 80 or so judges of the High Court is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division while in office. The
Lord Chancellor is president of the Chancery Division, administered by the
vice-president, the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s Bench Division is presided over
by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in
the legal hierarchy, and the Family Division is headed by the President. Outside
London (where the High Court sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings are
held at 25 Crown Court centres. For the hearing of cases at first instance, High
Court judges sit alone. Appeals in civil matters from lower courts are heard by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropriate
division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and guardianship proceedings heard by
magistrates’ courts go to a divisional court of the Family Division of the High
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

Proceedings
Court. Affiliation appeals are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from
decisions of the licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High
Court and county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and
may go on to the House of Lords, the final court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex-officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 23 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber), but
peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president of the
House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session. The civil
jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is normally
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff,
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or
directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and in general has jurisdiction to
deal with all kinds of action. The main exception is an action exclusive to the
sheriff court, where the value claimed is less than a set amount. It is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions of equal
status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being presided over by
the Lord President and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to
the Inner House may be made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court.
From the Inner House an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the
Court of Session are the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord
President of the Court of Session holds the office of Lord Justice General in the
High Court of Justiciary (see p 115).
The Scottish Land Court is a special court which deals exclusively with
matters concerning agriculture. Its chairman has the status and tenure of a
judge of the Court of Session and its other members are lay specialists in
agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in county courts, though
magistrates’ courts also deal with certain classes of civil case. The superior civil
law court is the High Court of Justice from which an appeal may be made to the
Court of Appeal. These two courts, together with the Crown Court, comprise the
Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland and their practice and
procedure are similar to those in England. The House of Lords is the final civil
appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry on the authenticity of the grievance is required. Actions
in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on the
defendant by the plaintiff, stating the nature of the claim. A defendant intending
to contest the claim informs the court. Documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County court
proceedings are initiated by a summons served on the defendant by the court;
subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but a procedure for
most undefended cases dispenses with the need to give evidence in court and
permits written evidence to be considered by the registrar.

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Restrictive

Administrative
Tribunals
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can usually be abandoned or ended by
compromise at any time. Actions brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution cases,
when either party may, except in certain special circumstances, insist on trial by
jury, or a fraud case, when the defendant may claim this right. The jury decides
questions of fact and damages awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts
may be accepted.
An action in a magistrates’ court is begun by a complaint on which the court
may serve the defendant with a summons. This contains details of the complaint
and the date on which it will be heard. Parties and witnesses give their evidence
at the court hearing. Domestic proceedings are normally heard by not more than
three lay justices including, where practicable, a woman; members of the public
are not allowed to be present. The court may order provision for custody, access
and supervision of children, as well as maintenance payments for spouses and
children.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor's goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the debtor’s
wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining
someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey judgment may result in
imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (lawyers' charges, court fees and
other payments) are within the discretion of the court. Normally, the court
orders them to be paid by the party losing the action, but in the case of family
law maintenance proceedings a magistrates’ court can order either party to pay
the whole or part of the other's costs.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions in the
sheriff court are initiated by serving the defender with a summons (an initial
writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session actions the next step is the
publication of the action in the court lists. A defender who intends to contest the
action must inform the court; if he or she does not appear, the court grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. In ordinary actions in the sheriff
court the defender is simply required to give notice of intention to defend within
a certain number of days after service of the initial writ, and this is followed by a
formal appearance in court by the parties to the dispute or their solicitors.
In summary causes (involving small sums) in the sheriff court the procedure is
less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in the summons. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the
parties involved having to appear in court. Normally they (or their representa¬
tives) need appear only when an action is defended.
Proceedings in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.
County court proceedings are commenced by a civil bill served on the defendant;
there are no pleadings in the county court. Judgments of civil courts are
enforceable through a centralised procedure administered by the Enforcement
of Judgments Office.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five judges
and up to ten other people with expertise in industry, commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of people or bodies exercising judicial func¬
tions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule, they are set up
under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions and

procedure. Their composition and procedures vary greatly. Compared with the
courts, they tend to be less expensive, less formal and more accessible; they also
have expert knowledge of their particular subjects. The expansion of the
tribunal system is comparatively recent, most tribunals having been set up since
1945. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and obliga¬
tions of private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. A number of important tribunals (notably
the rent and industrial tribunals) decide disputes between private citizens.
Some (such as those concerned with social security) resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further group (including tax tribunals)
decide disputed claims by public authorities against private citizens, and still
others decide issues in dispute which do not directly affect financial rights or
liabilities, such as entitlements to licences or the right to enter the United
Kingdom. Tribunals usually consist of an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached; some consist of one person sitting alone.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but
other authorities have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The Lord
Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland) makes
most appointments where a lawyer chairman or member is required.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be made
in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of Session and
in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. In some cases an appeal maybe made
to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a government minister or to an
independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, which hears appeals on
questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals, has High Court and
Court of Session status in Great Britain. The Council on Tribunals (an
independent body, established in 1958) exercises general supervision over many
tribunals, advising on draft legislation and rules of procedure, monitoring their
activities and reporting on particular matters; those peculiar to Scotland are
dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council. The Council has a similar
responsibility with regard to public inquiries.
Administration of the Law
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and is
not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister, who recommends the highest
judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords); he is concerned with court procedure and is responsible
for the administration of all courts other than magistrates' and coroners’ courts,
and (or a number of administrative tribunals. He also appoints magistrates, and
has general responsibility for the legal aid and advice schemes. He is also
responsible for the administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons, and the probation and after-care service;
and has general supervision over magistrates’ courts, together with some
specific responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks).
Prison policy and the administration of custodial centres are functions of the
Home Office Prison Department, and the Home Secretary appoints to each
prison establishment a Board of Visitors representing the local community who

need to satisfy themselves as to the state of prison premises, administration and
treatment of inmates. They are required to report to the Home Secretary any
abuse or matter of concern which comes to their attention. Boards have
disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline and hear
applications or complaints from inmates. The Home Secretary is advised by a
special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under 17 is shared between the
Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security. The Home
Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the exercise of the royal
prerogative of mercy to pardon a person convicted of a crime or to cancel all or
part of a penalty imposed by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing
accommodation for all the superior courts in England and Wales, except the
Central Criminal Court, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General (the Law Officers of the Crown
for England and Wales) are the Government’s principal advisers on English law,
and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international cases. They
are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons and hold
ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for Northern
Ireland. As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General
has final responsibility for enforcing the criminal law; the Director of Public
Prosecutions is subject to the Attorney General's superintendence. The Attorney
General is concerned with instituting and prosecuting certain types of criminal
proceedings, but must exercise an independent discretion, and must not be
influenced by government colleagues. The Solicitor General is, in effect, the
deputy of the Attorney General.
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,
staffing and organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local authorities. The Secretary of State
is also responsible for the criminal law of Scotland, crime prevention, and the
police and the penal system, and is advised on parole matters by the Parole
Board for Scotland. The Secretary of State is also responsible for legal aid in
Scotland and for the legal advice and assistance schemes.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal representa¬
tives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. Both are
government ministers. The Lord Advocate is closely concerned with questions of
legal policy and administration and is also responsible for the Scottish
parliamentary draftsmen. He has overall responsibility for the prosecution of
crime in Scotland and although he holds a ministerial post he must exercise an
independent discretion in carrying out this responsibility.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Lord Chancellor. The administration of all courts is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with the police and the penal system. The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for the legal aid and advice scheme in Northern Ireland.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen's Courts since the Crown is the
historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
129
Judges Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor, who is
head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet minister. With
the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from practising
barristers, advocates (in Scotland) or solicitors (see below). Thejudiciary is not a
career service as in many other countries. Lay magistrates in England and Wales
need no legal qualifications but on appointment undergo basic training to give
them sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence, and to
enable them to understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. The Scottish
district court justices of the peace likewise need no legal qualifications. In
Northern Ireland lay magistrates serving on juvenile courts undertake training
courses; resident magistrates are drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven
incapacity) judges of the inferior courts may be removed from their positions
but, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary from the executive,
superior judges in England and Wales and Northern Ireland (other than the Lord
Chancellor who changes with the Government) are subject to removal only by the
Queen on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there
is no statutory provision for removing judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and special legislation would probably be needed
to secure a dismissal.
The Legal
Profession
LEGAL AID,
ADVICE AND
ASSISTANCE
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as counsel'. Solicitors undertake legal business for
lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher courts; certain functions are common
to both. Although people are free to conduct their own cases, most people prefer
to be legally represented in the more serious cases.
The professional organisations for barristers are: the Senate of the Inns of
Court and the Bar (in England and Wales),1 the Faculty of Advocates (in
Scotland) and the General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland and the
Executive Council of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland. For solicitors they are:
the Law Society, the Law Society of Scotland and the Law Society of Northern
Ireland.
Legislation was introduced in 1985 to provide greater protection for the public
against inadequate professional work by solicitors in England and Wales.
A person in need of legal advice or legal representation in court may qualify for
help with the costs out of public funds, either free or with a contribution
according to his or her means, under the legal aid and advice and assistance
schemes.
People whose income and savings are within certain limits are entitled to help
from a solicitor on any legal matter as it affects the applicant’s particular
circumstances. Such help includes advice on the relevant law, writing letters on
the client s behalf, drafting wills and taking the opinion of a barrister or
advocate. In England and Wales it may be extended to cover representation in
civil proceedings in the magistrates' court, Mental Review Tribunal hearings
and certain disciplinary proceedings before prisons’ Boards of Visitors.
The scheme provides for initial work to be done up to a cost of £50 (£90 where
the client is the petitioner for a divorce or judicial separation in England and
Wales): thereafter the approval of the Law Society is required before further costs
can be incurred.
1 In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a barrister must be a
member of one of the four Inns of Court in London (Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple Middle Temple
and Gray’s Inn). F

Law Centres
Aid in Civil
Proceedings
Aid in Criminal
Proceedings
In a number of urban areas law centres provide free advice to people of limited
means. Most law centres (voluntary organisations financed from various
sources, including the local authority) have at least two full-time salaried lawyers
and many employ community workers. Much of their time is devoted to
tenant-landlord disputes and other housing problems. Free legal advice is also
available in Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing advice centres and
in specialist advice centres run by various voluntary organisations.
Legal aid, which covers representation before the court, is available for most civil
proceedings to those who satisfy the financial eligibility conditions.
An applicant for legal aid must show not only that he (or she) has grounds for
taking or defending proceedings but also that it is reasonable in all the
circumstances of his case that he should receive, or continue to receive, legal
aid. If legal aid is granted the case is conducted in the normal way except that no
money passes between the client and the solicitor; all payments are usually made
through the legal aid fund.
In certain circumstances the successful unassisted opponent of a legally aided
party may recover his costs in the case from the legal aid fund. Also, where the
assisted person successfully recovers or preserves money or property in the
proceedings the legal aid fund may have a first charge on that money or property
to recover the sums it has expended on the assisted person's behalf.
The civil legal aid schemes are administered by the Law Society, the Law
Society of Northern Ireland and (at present) the Law Society of Scotland while
ministerial responsibility for the schemes rests with the Lord Chancellor and, in
the case of Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant qualifies for financial help. An order must be made (subject to means)
when a person is committed for trial on a murder charge or where the prosecutor
appeals or applies for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) to the House of Lords. No person who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless given the opportunity to apply for
legal aid.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Lord Chancellor. Committees of
the Law Society provide a right of recourse against the refusal of legal aid in
some cases by a magistrates' court.
Under a national scheme the Law Society makes arrangements for duty
solicitors to be available at magistrates’ courts to provide initial advice and
representation to unrepresented defendants, and also for duty solicitors to be
available, on a 24-hour basis, to give advice and assistance to suspects at police
stations. The services of a duty solicitor are free.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, and in Scotland there is a duty solicitor scheme for
accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and the ‘interests
of justice’ test applies only in summary cases. In Northern Ireland a duty
solicitor scheme has been introduced at the principal magistrates court in
Belfast. Legal aid for criminal cases in Scotland and Northern Ireland is free; the
assisted person is not required to make any contributions towards the cost of
his or her legal representation.
A government scrutiny of the operation and administration of the legal aid
scheme in England and Wales was published in June 1986 and contained
recommendations for a major restructuring of the system to provide a more
efficient and effective service. Following the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, a new

non-departmental public body, the Scottish Legal Aid Board, will assume
responsibility for the administration of most legal aid functions in Scotland on 1
April 1987. Legal aid in solemn criminal cases (see p 114) will continue to be
awarded by the courts.
LAW REFORM While changes in the law are matters for Parliament, the duty of keeping the law
under review lies with the Law Reform Committee, the Criminal Law Revision
Committee and the Law Commission in England and Wales, and with the
Scottish Law Commission in Scotland. The Law Reform Committee and the
Criminal Law Revision Committee comprise judges and practising and
academic lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and the Home
Secretary, to examine aspects of the civil and criminal law in England and Wales.
The Law Commission, a permanent body reporting to the Lord Chancellor and
consisting of a High Court judge and four other members who are required to be
practising and academic lawyers, scrutinises the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, and its simplification and modernisation.
The Scottish Law Commission is similar, and reports to the Lord Advocate. Law
reform in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Law Commission and the Office of
Law Reform.
Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. The National Health Service provides
a comprehensive range of medical services which are available to all residents,
irrespective of means. Local authority personal social services and voluntary
organisations provide help and advice to elderly people, disabled people and
children in need of care. The social security system is designed to secure a basic
standard of living for people in financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn, help for families and assistance with costs arising
from disablement.
Central government is directly responsible for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local authorities. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community services.
Planned spending on social welfare in 1986-87 is: health £18,700 million and
personal social services £3,203 million (together representing 16 per cent of
general government expenditure); and social security nearly £43,000 million
(31 per cent).
Expenditure on the health service has increased in real terms by some 12 per
cent since 1980, and current spending is planned to grow further over the next
two years. More patients are now being treated than ever before. Spending on
social security is rising because of increased numbers of beneficiaries, especially
retirement pensioners and the unemployed, and the value of retirement and
most other long-term benefits has been increased in real terms since 1980.
Major reforms to the social security system are being introduced under the
Social Security Act 1986; these are designed to provide a clearer, simpler system
which will be more capable of meeting genuine need (see p 152). Spending on
the personal social services is determined by local authorities, and while
constraints are placed by central government on the total expenditure of
individual local authorities, gross current expenditure on personal social
services has increased by 10 per cent in real terms since 1980-81, thus
reflecting the priority given to this sector.
National Health Service
The National Health Service (NHS) is based upon the principle that there should
be a comprehensive range of publicly provided services designed to help the
individual to stay healthy and to provide effective and appropriate treatment and
care where necessary. All taxpayers, employers and employees contribute to its
cost so that those members of the community who do not require health care
help to pay for those who do. Some forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free of charge; others (see p 135) may be charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health service is being used to meet the needs
of increasing numbers of elderly people (over 45 per cent of health authority
expenditure on hospital and community services is spent on care of the elderly);

to take full advantage of advances in medical technology and to remedy shortfalls
in such areas as renal services; to provide more appropriate types of care, often
in the community rather than in hospital, for priority groups like the elderly,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people; to combat the growing health
problems arising from alcohol and drug misuse; and to remedy disparities in
provision between the regions of Britain.
The Government emphasises the importance of preventive health services,
and the responsibility of individuals for their own health. While great progress
has been made in eliminating infectious diseases such as poliomyelitis and
tuberculosis, there has been less success in controlling the major causes of
death—heart disease, cancer and stroke—which accounted for some two-thirds
of all deaths in England in 1984. Because of the close link between such diseases
and individual life-styles or social habits, emphasis is placed on helping people
to adopt healthier ways of living through education and other policies.
The Government stresses the need for a partnership between the public and
private health sectors and for improving efficiency in order to secure the best
value for money and the maximum patient care. In order to secure more effective
management of resources in the National Health Service, general managers
drawn from inside and outside the Service have been appointed at all levels.
Further measures have included improving the accountability of health
authorities for the way in which they plan and manage their resources,
increasing the proportion of total staff who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses, and the introduction of a range of programmes to provide
existing services at lower cost. Considerable savings have been made in many
areas through a policy of competitive tendering for hospital ancillary services
such as cleaning, catering and laundry. Economies are also made in prescribing
by restricting the use of expensive branded products in favour of cheaper but
equally effective generic equivalents.
The health ministers (the Secretary of State for Social Services in England and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are respon¬
sible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries. The
health departments (the Department of Health and Social Security in England,
the Scottish Home and Health Department, the Welsh Office and the Depart¬
ment of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland) are responsible for
national strategic planning. District health authorities in England and Wales
and health boards in Scotland are responsible for planning and operational
control of all health services in their areas. In England, because of its greater size
and population, a tier of regional authorities is responsible for regional
planning, resource allocation, major capital building work and certain special¬
ised hospital services best administered on a regional basis. The authorities and
boards co-operate closely with local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other services. Family practitioner com¬
mittees (health boards in Scotland), accountable to the Secretary of State,
arrange for the provision of services by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and
opticians. Community health councils represent local opinion on the health
services provided. (In Scotland this function is exercised by local health
councils.)
In Northern Ireland health and social services boards are responsible for all
health and personal social services in their areas. The representation of public
opinion on these services is provided for by district committees.
There are three Health Service Commissioner posts (for England, Scotland and
Wales) for dealing with complaints from members of the public about the health
service. All three posts are held by the Parliamentary Commissioner for
SOCIAL WELFARE
135
Administration (Ombudsman). The jurisdiction of the Health Service Commis¬
sioner covers the failure of a health authority or family practitioner committee to
carry out its statutory duties, a failure in a service provided, or maladministra¬
tion causing injustice or hardship, but not actions taken solely in the exercise of
clinical judgment or the actions of family doctors, for which separate complaints
procedures exist. The Commissioner reports annually to ministers who lay the
reports before Parliament, and may make other reports when necessary. In
Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints has a similar role.
Finance
PRIMARY
HEALTH
CARE
About 86 per cent of the cost of the health service is paid for through general
taxation; the rest is met from the National Health Service contribution paid with
the National Insurance contribution and from the charges towards the cost of
certain items such as drugs prescribed by a family doctor, and dental treatment.
Health authorities may raise funds from voluntary sources. Certain hospitals
increase their revenue by taking private patients who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment.
The charges for medical prescriptions do not apply to children under 16 years,
expectant mothers and women who have had a baby in the last 12 months,
women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over, patients suffering from
certain medical conditions, war and armed forces disablement pensioners (for
treatment of their disability), and families with very low incomes. Some 70 per
cent of prescription items are supplied free of charge. No charges for dental
treatment are made for dental examinations and denture repairs. Some groups
of patients receive entirely free dental treatment, for example, women who are
pregnant or who have had a baby in the last year, anyone under the age of 18, or
19 if in full-time education, and people receiving supplementary benefit or
family income supplement (see p 157). Patients with low incomes may have their
charges remitted. Some groups also receive grants towards the cost of
spectacles.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and can be employed full time or part time.
Hospital doctors can accept private patients. Family practitioners (doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists) are self-employed contractors. Doctors
(also known as general practitioners) are paid by a system of fees and allowances
designed to reflect responsibilities, workload and practice expenses. Dentists
providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale of fees.
Pharmacists dispensing on their own premises are reimbursed for the cost of
the items supplied together with professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the general ophthalmic
service receive approved fees for each sight test made; opticians who dispense
spectacles are paid a fee based on the number and type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is offered by doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists
working within the Service as independent practitioners, and by health visitors,
district nurses and midwives employed by the health authorities. A wide range
of other services is also available, including the school health service and the
chiropody service. The remedial professions of physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and speech therapy are making an increasingly important contribution
to primary care.
There have been substantial increases in primary care staff in recent years- for
example, the number of doctors and dentists in England increased by 14 per
cent and 20 per cent respectively between 1978 and 1984, and the average
number of patients per doctor fell by 10 per cent, from 2,312 to 2,089.
Special funds have been earmarked by the Government for improving the
quality of primary health care in inner city areas.

The family practitioner services are those given to patients by doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. Family doctors provide the first
diagnosis in the case of illness and either prescribe a suitable course of
treatment or refer a patient to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Only ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians
may test sight; patients requiring treatment for a defect in sight or an eye
disease are dealt with through the Hospital Eye Service. In order to provide the
public with a wider and cheaper choice of spectacles, the monopoly on the
supply of spectacles held by registered ophthalmic and dispensing opticians was
ended in 1985 and unregistered opticians may now sell spectacles to adults
under carefully prescribed conditions. The supply of NHS spectacles to children,
those on low incomes and people requiring complex lenses was replaced during
1986 by a voucher system. Under this, people previously eligible for NHS
spectacles are provided with vouchers which may be exchanged for low-priced
spectacles on sale through the private market, or put towards the cost of
higher-priced frames.
Some wide-ranging suggestions on possible extensions of the pharmacist's
role have been the subject of a recent inquiry.
Health visitors are responsible for the preventive care and health education of all
families, particularly those with young children. They work closely with general
practitioners, district nurses and other professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere outside hospital; they also play an
important role in preventive care and health education. Although almost all
babies are born in hospital, some antenatal care and most postnatal care is
given in the community by midwives and general practitioners, who also care for
women who have their babies at home. All midwives are responsible for
educating and supporting women and their families during the childbearing
period.
About four-fifths of family doctors in Britain work in partnerships or group
practices, often as members of health-care teams which also include health
visitors and district nurses and sometimes midwives, social workers and other
professional staff. About a quarter in Great Britain and over a half in Northern
Ireland work in modern and well-equipped health centres, where medical and
nursing services are provided. Health centres may also have facilities for health
education, family planning, speech therapy, chiropody, assessment of hearing,
physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical and ophthalmic
services, hospital out-patient and supporting social work services may also be
provided.
A full range of hospital services is provided by district general hospitals,
including treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and
out-patients, maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and
geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of
specialised treatment. There are also specialist hospitals or units for children,
mentally ill, mentally handicapped and elderly people, and for the treatment of
specific diseases; examples include the world-famous Hospital for Sick Children,
Great Ormond Street, and the Brompton Heart and Chest Hospital in London.
Hospitals designated as teaching hospitals combine treatment facilities with
training medical and other students and research work.
Many of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in the
nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’ hospitals in
London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing buildings and

many new hospitals have been or are being opened. Major hospital schemes
completed in England over the last five years have provided 27 accident and
emergency departments, 122 X-ray rooms, 189 operating theatres, over 11,500
beds and 25 out-patient departments; over 150 other schemes, costing more
than £1,000 million, are being planned or constructed.
Recent policy in England and Wales has been to provide smaller hospitals for
local areas in preference to large district hospitals which may be remote from
local communities. The latest development in hospital design is the ‘nucleus’
hospital of some 300 beds which makes more intensive use of space and
facilities; it can be used either as the first stage of a new hospital or as an
extension of an existing one. The world's first low-energy nucleus hospital,
which is expected to use less than half the energy of an ordinary nucleus
hospital, is under construction on the Isle of Wight.
National Health Service hospitals provide nearly half a million beds and have
over 480,000 medical, nursing and midwifery staff. The hospital service is now
treating more patients per year than ever before: between 1978 and 1984 the
number of in-patient cases treated rose by 808,000 (15 per cent); the number of
day case attendances by 341,000 (61 per cent) and there were 31 million (9 per
cent) more out-patient attendances. Newer forms of treatment and diagnosis,
such as kidney dialysis, hip replacements, laser treatment for certain eye
conditions, and body scanning are being made more widely available. Com¬
munity services such as the psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals, and local
authority day centres have expanded so that more patients remain in the
community and others are discharged sooner from hospital.
It is the Government s policy to encourage the private sector to meet a larger
share of the nation’s health needs in the belief that this will benefit the National
Health Service by relieving pressure on it. Some health authorities share
expensive facilities and equipment with private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the private sector to reduce waiting
lists. The scale of private practice in relation to the NHS is, however, small. Some
6 per cent of acute hospital beds are in private hospitals and nursing homes and
about 1,150 beds in health service hospitals in England are occupied by private
patients. It is estimated that about half of those receiving acute treatment in
private hospitals or hospital pay-beds are covered by provident schemes which
make provision for private health care in return for annual subscriptions. In
1986 there were some 5 million subscribers to such schemes of whom the
majority were involved in group schemes, some arranged by firms on behalf of
employees. Subscriptions often cover more than one person (for example,
members of a family). Private practice is also undertaken by family doctors and
dentists. Many overseas patients come to Britain for treatment in private
hospitals and clinics, and Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is growing interest in alternative therapies such as homeopathy,
osteopathy and acupuncture, which are mainly practised outside the National
Health Service.
Over the past 25 years there have been significant developments in transplant
surges in Britain. Since 1972 the United Kingdom Transplant Service has pro-
vi ed a centralised kidney matching and distribution service. At the end of 1984
about 5,500 people were living with functioning kidney transplants and during
85 some 1,300 more kidney transplants were performed. In 1983 a similar
service was initiated for corneas, about 1,500 being transplanted each year.
eart transplant operations have been conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire since 1979 and at Harefield Hospital, West London, since 1980.

A third heart transplant centre has been established at the Freeman Hospital in
Newcastle upon Tyne. By March 1986, 414 transplants had been performed;
one-year survival is currently about 70 per cent and the three-year survival rate
is 55 per cent. A programme of combined heart and lung transplants began at
Harefield in December 1983, 58 having been performed by the end of March
1986. Other organs and tissues which are now successfully being transplanted
include the liver, the pancreas and bone marrow. A voluntary organ donor card
system enables people to indicate their willingness to become organ donors in
the event of their death. Several million people now participate in the scheme.
The blood transfusion service collects over 2 million donations of blood and over
44,000 donations of plasma each year from voluntary unpaid donors. Regional
transfusion centres recruit donors and organise donor sessions in towns and
villages, factories and offices, and within the armed forces. Donors must be
between the ages of 18 and 65. The centres are also responsible for blood
grouping and testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultancy service
to hospitals, teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and
technicians. Central laboratories manufacture blood products and undertake
research. While the use of whole blood for transfusions remains an important
part of the Service’s work, there is increasing emphasis on the most efficient and
effective use of blood and in particular its separation into components such as
plasma for specific uses. A new laboratory is being built at Elstree, Hertford¬
shire, with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency in blood products in England
and Wales.
Where necessary on medical grounds free transport by ambulance is provided by
the health authorities. The ambulance service performs emergency work,
dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity cases, and accidents of all kinds;
and non-urgent work, providing transport for people needing out-patient
treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals. In some areas the service for
non-urgent cases is augmented by voluntary organisations using their own
vehicles or by volunteers using their own cars. In Scotland an air ambulance
service is available in the islands and in the remoter parts of the mainland.
Rehabilitation, an important part of which is patient care, begins at the onset of
illness or injury and continues throughout with the aim of helping people to
adjust to changes in life-style and to live as normally as possible. It is especially
important for elderly, young, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped
people who need such help to resume life in the community. Rehabilitation
activities are carried out in hospitals, centres in the community and in people's
own homes through co-ordinated work by a range of professional workers
including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech
therapists, hearing therapists, clinical psychologists, dietitians and social
workers. These staff may also work closely with the disablement resettlement
service of the Manpower Services Commission (the Department of Economic
Development in Northern Ireland), housing, education and social services
departments of local authorities and with the voluntary sector.
Medical services may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial limbs
and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely physically handicapped patients may be
provided with environmental control equipment which enables them to operate
devices such as alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating
appliances. Nursing aids can be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of facilities to assist patients in the
transition from hospital to their own homes, including the provision of aids and

adaptations, domiciliary care from home helps and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers. Voluntary organisations also
provide valuable help in complementing the work of the statutory agencies and
in widening the range of available services.
A number of hospices provide care for the dying (including children) either
directly in residential homes or through nursing and other assistance in the
patient s own home. Control of symptoms and psychological support for patients
their families form the central features of the modern hospice movement,
which originated in Britain and is now world-wide. Some hospices are
administered entirely by the National Health Service; the remainder, some of
which receive support from public funds, are run by independent charities. The
Government is encouraging a greater co-operation between the voluntary sector
and health authorities in this field.
Special preventive services are provided under the health service to safeguard
the health of expectant mothers and mothers with young children. Services
include free dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins; vaccination and
immunisation against certain diseases (see p 143); and health education, which
is available to parents before and after childbirth through talks, discussion
groups and demonstrations. Pregnant women are given antenatal care by their
family doctor and hospital clinics, and working women have the right to visit the
clinics during working hours. Some 98 per cent of women have their babies in
hospital, returning home shortly afterwards to be attended by the family doctor,
a midwife and a health visitor. The Government attaches great importance to
improving the quality of maternity services, and to making them more sensitive
to the needs and wishes of mothers and their families; it is advised by the
Maternity Services Advisory Committee. The perinatal mortality rate (the
number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life) has fallen in recent
years and in 1985 stood at 9-8 per thousand births in England and Wales,
compared with 15-4 per thousand in 1978.
A network of child health clinics in general practice premises or in the
community provides facilities for surveillance by doctors, dentists and health
visitors of the physical and mental health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services is given and welfare foods are
distributed. About 95 per cent of babies under one year are taken to the clinics.
The school health service offers health care and advice for schoolchildren,
including medical surveillance and dental inspection and treatment where
necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services provide help and advice for
children with psychological or emotional problems.
In recent years special efforts have been made to improve co-operation
between the community-based child health services and local authority social
services for children, particularly to prevent child abuse and to benefit the
health and welfare of children in care.
The birth of the world's first test-tube baby’ in Britain in 1978, using the
technique of in vitro fertilisation, opened up new horizons for the alleviation of
infertility and for the science of embryology, but also gave rise to unease at the
apparently uncontrolled advances of science and the new possibilities of
manipulating the early stages of human development. In view of this public
concern, a committee of inquiry was established in 1982 under Baroness
Warnock to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of developments in
this field. Reporting in 1984, the committee concluded that certain specialised
forms of infertility treatment, including artificial insemination by donor and in
140

vitro fertilisation, were ethically acceptable, but that surrogate motherhood (the
practice whereby one woman bears a child for another) organised by agencies
should be prohibited; that research on human embryos was acceptable, but only
up to the fourteenth day after fertilisation; and that a licensing authority should
be established to regulate infertility services and research. Following the first
birth to be arranged by a commercial surrogacy agency in Britain in January
1985, legislation to ban commercial surrogacy agencies, and advertising of or for
surrogacy services, was passed later that year. The Government is considering
its response to the wider recommendations of the committee and has made clear
its intention to introduce comprehensive legislation as soon as possible.
Free family planning facilities are available through family planning clinics,
hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide a similar service
for women only. »
The Abortion Act 1967 allows the termination of pregnancy by a registered
doctor if two registered doctors consider that its continuance would involve a
greater risk to the life of the pregnant woman (or of injury to her physical or
mental health or that of any existing children in the family) than if the
pregnancy were ended. Termination may also be allowed if two doctors consider
that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from
such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
Abortions are carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in private
premises approved for the purpose by the Secretary of State. Over half of the
141,100 legal abortions to women resident in England and Wales in 1985 were
performed in private hospitals and clinics. The Act does not apply in Northern
Ireland.
The growing misuse of dangerous drugs such as heroin and cocaine has
emerged as a serious social and health problem and the Government has made
the fight against such misuse a major priority. Its strategy comprises action to
reduce the supply of illicit drugs from abroad and to tighten controls on drugs
produced and supplied in Britain; to provide even more effective law enforce¬
ment by the police and customs services; to increase the deterrent effects of the
law; to support effective programmes to treat and rehabilitate misusers; and to
discourage young people from experimenting with drugs. As part of its
prevention policy, the Government initiated a £2-3 million publicity campaign
in 1985 to dissuade young people from drug-taking and to advise parents,
teachers and other professional staff on how to recognise and combat the
problem. Additional funds of £2 million have been allocated to develop the
campaign in 1986—87. Over £17 million has been provided for local treatment
and rehabilitation projects for up to three years and an additional £5 million a
year to regional health authorities in England from 1986—87 has been made
available for the expansion of services for drug misusers. The Government has
set up a drugs advisory service to advise district health authorities on the
development of facilities in their areas, and has made funds available since April
1986 for local education authorities in England and Wales to appoint staff to
promote and co-ordinate preventive work in their areas. Separate programmes
and campaigns are in progress in Scotland.
The Government is advised on a wide range of matters relating to drug misuse
and connected social problems by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
The Council reported in 1982 on treatment and rehabilitation services, and in
1984 reviewed prevention policy and security arrangements for the storage and
transit of controlled drugs.
Treatment for drug dependence is mainly provided on an out-patient basis.
SOCIAL WELFARE
141
Solvent Misuse
Smoking
Many hospitals provide specialist treatment for drug misusers, mainly in
psychiatric units, or have special drug treatment units. Some addicts have a
period of in-patient treatment when necessary. An increasing number of family
doctors also treat addicts but only certain specialist doctors are licensed to
prescribe heroin, cocaine and dipipanone (diconal). All doctors have a duty to
notify the authorities of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain
controlled drugs, and guidelines on good medical practice in the treatment of
drug misuse have been issued to all doctors in Great Britain. The Home
Secretary has statutory powers for dealing with doctors found to have prescribed
irresponsibly.
A number of non-statutory agencies work with and complement the health
service provision; advice and rehabilitation services including residential
facilities, for example, are mainly provided by voluntary organisations. Support
in the community is provided by the probation service and local social services
departments.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse is funded by several government
departments.
Action is also being taken by the Government to curb the incidence of solvent
abuse (the inhaling of vapour from glue, lighter fuel and other solvents) by young
people. In 1983 voluntary guidelines were drawn up in co-operation with
retailers to curb the sale of solvents, and legislation passed in Scotland added
solvent misuse to the list of grounds on which a child may be considered to need
compulsory care. In 1985 legislation was passed which made it an offence in
England and Wales to supply such substances to children under 18 knowing or
having reason to believe they are to be used to cause intoxication. (Such sales
have been prosecuted successfully under common law in Scotland.) Information
and guidance material have been distributed to parents, teachers and other
professional workers to help them to educate young people on the dangers of the
habit and to dissuade them from experimenting.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. It accounts for no fewer than 100,000 premature deaths each year and
costs the NHS an estimated £370 million a year for the treatment of diseases
attributable to smoking (for example, heart disease, lung cancer and bronchi¬
tis). Concerned at these harmful effects, the Government is following an active
health education policy based on advice and education, supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry aimed at reducing the level of smoking.
National public and media campaigns organised by the government-funded
Health Education Council and the Scottish Health Education Group form the
main thrust of official efforts to discourage smoking. In 1986 the Government
launched a £ 1 million media campaign directed at young people in two test areas
in England. The Government also supports the work of the voluntary organisa¬
tion Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), and seeks to encourage restrictions
on smoking in trains, buses, theatres and other public places Health
authorities have been encouraged to promote non-smoking as the normal
practice on health service premises and to give help and advice to people who
want to give up smoking.
Voluntary agreements between the Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, tobacco product
modification and sports sponsorship by the industry. A new voluntary
agreement on tobacco advertising came into effect in April 1986. This provides
for the use of six different health warnings about the dangers of smoking It also
contains measures to protect particularly vulnerable groups such as children
young people and young women in early childbearing years; and provide a
142

mechanism for monitoring implementation of the agreement. Cigarette adver¬
tising is banned on television and radio by law and in cinemas by the voluntary
agreement.
Cigarette consumption in Britain has fallen by over 20 per cent since 1978,
reflecting a significant reduction in the proportion of people who smoke.
There has been a growing public awareness in recent years of the importance to
good health of a correct diet. Further evidence of this connection was provided in
1984 in a report on diet and cardiovascular disease produced by the government
Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy. This advised that a reduction in
the amount of certain fats in the diet could help to reduce the incidence or to
delay the onset of cardiovascular disease. In order to help people to reduce their
fat intake, the Government plans to introduce statutory requirements for the
labelling of food to indicate fat content; full nutritional labelling which would
include information on energy, protein and carbohydrate content is being
encouraged on a voluntary basis. Certain supermarket chains have already
introduced voluntary labelling schemes. In addition, the Health Education
Council and the British Nutrition Foundation have produced practical dietary
advice based on the committee’s report.
The far-reaching effects of alcohol misuse in terms of illness, family disruption,
inefficiency at work, loss of earnings, accidents and crime are widely acknow¬
ledged. The Government considers that the reduction of such misuse requires a
range of action by central and local government, voluntary and community
bodies, the health professions, business and trade unions. Of great importance
is the need for individuals to recognise and accept responsibility for their own
health, while attempts to influence the minority who misuse alcohol must, to be
realistic, respect the freedom of the majority who use alcohol responsibly.
The Government believes that emphasis should be placed on policies to
prevent alcohol misuse and, in conjunction with the Health Education Council
and other agencies, it continues to seek better information about the causes of
problem drinking, to encourage healthier life-styles and to provide earlier
identification and help for the problem drinker.
Treatment and rehabilitation include in-patient and out-patient services in
general and mental hospitals and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (general practitioners, nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing hostels, day centres and counselling services
also play an important role. There is close co-operation between statutory and
voluntary organisations and a new voluntary agency. Alcohol Concern, was
established with government help in 1983 by merging a number of smaller
bodies (funding for 1985-86 amounted to £450,000); the organisation is
playing a prominent role in prevention of misuse, training for professional and
voluntary workers and improving the network of local voluntary agencies and
their collaboration with statutory bodies. The Scottish Council on Alcohol
undertakes similar activities in Scotland. Research and surveys on various
aspects of alcohol misuse are funded by several government departments.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted mainly by
the government-financed Health Education Council. The Council mounts
campaigns, produces health education material and engages in a range of
research and evaluation work. It co-operates closely with the health authorities,
professional organisations, voluntary bodies and industry. Its activities strongly
support government action on smoking and problem drinking, and other topics
covered include preparation for parenthood, diet and exercise, dental health,
prevention of coronary heart disease and AIDS (see below). The Government’s

funding of the Council increased to £10-1 million in 1985-86. Health education
in Scotland is promoted by the Scottish Health Education Group.
Almost all health authorities now have their own health education service
which works closely with health professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to determine the most suitable local
programmes. Increased resources in the health service are being directed
towards health education and preventive measures.
District health authorities (health boards in Scotland) carry out programmes of
immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (women and girls only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough.
Immunisation is voluntary. Parents are encouraged to protect their children
since the benefits of immunisation far outweigh the small risk of adverse
reactions. The proportion of children being vaccinated has been increasing
since the end of 1978 following an earlier decline. A three-year campaign to
increase the take-up of rubella immunisation among girls aged 10 to 14 and
women who were not immune was launched in 1983. A series of measures is
being taken to limit the spread of the disease AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome). These include steps to improve the safety of blood and blood
products through the screening of blood donations and the heat treatment of
blood and blood products; the launch in early 1986 of a £2-5 million national
publicity campaign to improve understanding of the disease and the ways in
which its spread can be controlled; and the provision of an additional £2-5
million for the three London regional health authorities expected to carry the
heaviest burden of the disease to provide treatment and counselling services.
Research into the disease is continuing.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct research
and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of communicable diseases.
Its largest establishment is the recently rebuilt Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. Two surveillance
centres, one in England and one in Scotland, investigate and monitor human
communicable diseases. Microbiological work in Scotland and Northern Ireland
is conducted mainly in hospital laboratories.
The cervical screening programme aims to reduce deaths from cancer of the
cervix by ensuring that women at risk are screened regularly to identify the early
signs of the disease. The Government has announced that all health authorities
are to have computerised call and recall systems and adequate laboratory
support for cervical cancer screening by 1988.
Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible for
the control of air pollution and noise, food hygiene and safety, occupational
health and safety aspects of a variety of premises including offices and shops,
the investigation of unfit housing, and in some instances for refuse collection
and home safety. Doctors who specialise in community medicine and are
employed by the health authorities advise local authorities on the medical
aspects of environmental health, infectious diseases and food poisoning. They
may also co-operate with the authorities responsible for water supply and
sewerage. Environmental health officers at ports and airports carry out duties
concerned with shipping, inspection of imported foods and disease control. In
Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collection
and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and hygiene.

It is illegal to sell food unfit for human consumption or to apply any treatment,
process or additive to food which makes it injurious to health. Premises where
food or drink is prepared, handled, stored or sold must conform to certain
hygiene standards. Environmental health officers may take for analysis or for
bacteriological or other examination samples of any food on sale or in the
distribution chain. Special regulations control the safety of particular foods
such as milk, meat, ice-cream and shellfish. The Department of Health and
Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish
Office, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland are the central departments responsible for giving advice and
making regulations.
Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicinal products. The Committees on
Safety of Medicines, on Dental and Surgical Materials and on the Review of
Medicines advise on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products. The
Committee on Safety of Medicines also monitors adverse drug reactions. The Act
also controls the advertising, labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply
of medicinal products.
In 1985—86 the health departments spent about £25 million on research and
development, in addition to expenditure by the Medical Research Council (the
main government agency for the support of biomedical research). Priority areas
include primary care, mental health and handicap, physical handicap and
rehabilitation, care of the elderly and children, and dental and nursing research.
The programme is administered in England and Wales by the Chief Scientist of
the Department of Health and Social Security (in Scotland by the Chief Scientist
of the Scottish Home and Health Department) who is supported by independent
advisers covering a wide range of scientific disciplines. The Department is
involved in international research and development, and all the health
departments participate in the European Community's medical and public
health research programme.
Only people whose names are on the medical or dentists' registers may practise
as doctors or dentists in the National Health Service. University medical and
dental schools are responsible for teaching; the National Health Service provides
hospital clinical facilities for training. Full registration as a doctor requires five
or six years' training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years' training at a dental
school is required. The regulating body for the medical profession is the General
Medical Council and for dentists, the General Dental Council. The main
professional associations are the British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
The minimum period of training required to qualify for registration as a first
level nurse in general, mental or mental handicapped nursing (and sick
children’s nursing in Scotland) is normally three years. Registration as a second
level nurse (enrolled nurse) takes two years (in Scotland 18 months). Midwifery
training for registered general nurses takes 18 months, and for other student
midwives in England three years. Health visitors are registered general nurses
with midwifery or approved obstetric experience who have successfully com¬
pleted a one-year course in health visiting. District nurses are registered general
nurses who have successfully completed a six-month course followed by a period
of supervised practice in district nursing. The examining bodies for all nurses,

midwives and health visitors are the National Boards for Nursing, Midwifery and
Health Visiting established in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The regulation and registration of these professions is the responsibility of the
United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting.
Pharmacists in general practice and in hospital must be registered with the
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland. A three-year degree course approved by the Pharmaceutical
Society followed by a year’s approved training is necessary before registration.
The majority of medicines can be sold or dispensed only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
The General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispens-
ing opticians take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practical experience
or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory scientific officers, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiothera¬
pists and radiographers. The governing bodies are seven boards, corresponding
to the professions, under the general supervision of the Council for Professions
Supplementary to Medicine. Training lasts one to four years and only those who
are state registered may be employed in the National Health Service and some
other public services.
Dental therapists (who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental
hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may carry out
some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The member states of the European Community have special health arrange¬
ments under which Community nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive any immediately necessary treatment, either free or at a
reduced cost, during visits to other Community countries. There are also
arrangements to cover people who go to work or live in other Community
countries. In addition, there are reciprocal arrangements with some other
countries under which immediately necessary medical treatment is available to
visitors. Visitors are generally expected to pay if the purpose of their visit is to
seek medical treatment. Visitors to or from countries with whom reciprocal
arrangements have not been made are obliged to pay for any medical treatment
they receive.
Personal Social Services
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services
authorities (local authority social services departments in England and Wales
social work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland). Their services are directed towards elderly people, children
and young people, families, people with mental illness or with physical or mental
handicap, young offenders and other disadvantaged individuals and their
carers. The major services include residential care, day care, community care
and various forms of social work. Close co-operation is maintained between local
authority social services departments and health authorities (and other
agencies), and funding for joint schemes is being increased. In Scotland local
authorities also undertake duties similar to those of the separate probation and
prison after-care service in England and Wales.
Much of the care given to the elderly and disabled people is provided in the
community itself, by their families, self-help groups and through voluntary
146
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Elderly

People
agencies. The statutory sector offers the skilled care needed in particular
services. The importance of the contribution made by the voluntary organisa¬
tions is recognised especially when economies are being made in public
expenditure and the demand on the statutory services is heavy.
The demand for personal social services is expected to rise over the next few
years, owing to the number of elderly people and the changing pattern of care for
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and the chronically sick. The
Government’s policy, embodied in a ‘Care in the Community’ programme, is to
speed up the transfer from hospital to care in the community of patients who do
not specifically need hospital care. It believes that groups such as the elderly, the
disabled, and mentally ill or handicapped people can lead more normal lives in
the community, given appropriate support and facilities.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to help
them to live at home whenever possible. (Only about 5 per cent of the elderly over
65 live in institutional accommodation.) These services may include advice and
help given by social workers, domestic help, delivery of cooked meals, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, luncheon clubs
and recreational workshops. Appropriate adaptations to the home can overcome
problems of restricted mobility, and there is a wide range of environmental aids
to help people with impaired hearing or vision. Mobile alarm call systems have
been developed to help elderly housebound people obtain assistance in an
emergency and in some areas ‘good neighbour' and friendly visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation. Many local
authorities provide free or subsidised travel to elderly people within their areas.
Social services authorities also provide residential care for the elderly and infirm
and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or privately.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, provide
accommodation specially designed for elderly people; some of these develop¬
ments have resident wardens. Housing associations and private builders also
build this type of accommodation.
Local social services authorities provide a wide range of personal social services
for disabled people to assist with social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are also required to establish the number of disabled people in
their area and to publicise services, which may include counselling on personal
and social problems arising from disability; occupational, educational, social
and- recreational facilities, either at day centres or elsewhere: adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, and ground-floor toilets); aids to daily
living; the delivery of cooked meals; and domestic or care attendant help. In
cases of special need, assistance may be given with the installation of a
telephone or a television set. For severely disabled people residential accom¬
modation or respite care may be provided by local authorities and voluntary
organisations, and specially designed housing may be available for those able to
look after themselves. Some authorities provide free or subsidised travel for
disabled people on public transport, and they are encouraged to provide special
access facilities to public buildings.
Social services authorities make arrangements for the provision of preventive
care for mentally ill people and after-care for both mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people in the community. Services include training centres for the
mentally handicapped and day centres for the mentally ill, as well as social
centres and a variety of residential care for mentally ill and mentally handicap¬
ped people of all ages. Social workers help patients and their families to deal with
social and family problems arising from mental illness or mental handicap and

in certain circumstances can make an application for a mentally disordered
person's compulsory admission to and detention in hospital. The rights of
compulsorily detained patients were extended by legislation in 1983, and a
Mental Health Act Commission was set up to provide better safeguards.
Corresponding legislation was introduced for Scotland in 1984, although the
Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland was first established in 1962.
Two recent priorities have been to transfer mentally handicapped children
from long-stay hospitals to community care, and, through a number of special
projects, to improve care for elderly mentally ill people.
An important role in provision of services is played by the many voluntary
organisations concerned with mental illness and mental handicap.
The Government believes in the central importance of the family to the
well-being of society and that stable adult relationships are necessary to support
and enhance family life. Social services authorities, through their own social
workers, give practical help and advice to families facing special problems. This
help includes services for children at risk of injury or neglect who require
accommodation, and support for family carers who look after elderly and other
family members in order to give them a respite. They also help lone parents,
including unmarried mothers, and counsel divorced or separated women. There
are now many refuges run by local authorities or voluntary organisations for
women, often with young children, whose home conditions have become
intolerable. The refuges provide short-term accommodation and support while
attempts are made to alleviate the women’s problems. Many authorities also
contribute to the cost of social work with families (such as marriage guidance)
carried out by voluntary organisations.
An initiative launched by the Government in 1983 seeks to increase voluntary
sector provision in England for disadvantaged families with children under five.
In the same year the Family Policy Studies Centre was established with official
funding to review the impact of public policies on the family and to bring
together research findings.
Day care facilities for children under five are provided by local authorities, by
voluntary agencies and privately. In allocating places in the day nurseries and
other facilities they themselves provide, local authorities give priority to children
with special social or health needs for day care. They also register, and provide
support and advice services for, childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups operating in their areas.
The authorities are empowered to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties to promote the welfare of children. The aim is to intervene
at an early stage to reduce the need to receive children into care or bring them
before a court.
The recognition, prevention and management of cases of child abuse are the
joint concern of many authorities, agencies and professions, and local review
committees provide a forum for discussion and co-ordination and draw up
policies and procedures for handling these cases.
Authorities must receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has
no parent or guardian, who has been abandoned, or whose parents are unable to
provide for him or her, if they are satisfied that such intervention is in the best
interests of the child. The child remains in care until the age of 18 unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends. The local authority
may find it necessary to assume the rights and duties of one or both parents.
The parents must be notified and if they object the matter is decided in a court of
law. When taking a decision concerning a child in care, the authorities have to
give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the
148
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Adoption
child. Where children are in care, every effort is made to work with their families
in order, where appropriate, to enable the children to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if they
are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, are beyond the control of
parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed an offence
other than homicide. At the same time it must be shown that the children need
care or control which they are unlikely to receive unless a care order or other
relevant order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for
undertaking inquiries through social workers and consultation with parents,
schools and the police. Children may be committed to the care of a local
authority under a care order if the court considers this appropriate. As an
alternative the court may order supervision by a social worker or a probation
officer for up to three years.
Increasing use is being made of intermediate treatment, especially for young
offenders. This is a community-based service which provides supervised
activities, groupwork and individual counselling; a short, residential period may
sometimes be included. A requirement to attend a programme of intermediate
treatment may be added to a supervision order by the court.
The law relating to children in care in England and Wales is currently under
review with the aim of rationalisation and amendment.
In Northern Ireland the court may send children to a training school, commit
them to the care of a fit person (which includes a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order. The law relating to children is being
reviewed and the intention in future is to make a distinction between young
offenders and children in need of care and protection. Strong emphasis is placed
on preventive work.
In Scotland children in trouble or in need may be brought before a children’s
hearing, which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it thinks that
compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Under these requirements most
children are allowed to remain at home under the supervision of a social worker
but some may live with foster parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of not
more than one year until terminated by a children's hearing or by the Secretary
of State.
When appropriate, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
considered appropriate or cannot be found, the child may be placed in a
children’s home, voluntary home or other suitable residential accommodation.
Community homes for children in care in England and Wales comprise local
authority and some voluntary children’s homes, and include community homes
with education on the premises which provide long-term care usually for the
more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for placing
children in their care in foster homes, in local authority or voluntary homes, or
in residential schools. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes for
children in the care of the health and social services boards; training schools
and remand homes are administered separately. Regulations concerning
community homes, registered voluntary homes and the boarding out of children
in care are made by central government.
It is generally accepted that adoption is an appropriate way to find a new family
for a very wide range of children of all age groups, including those with physical
and mental handicaps. About 2,000 of the 9,000 children adopted each year
were previously in the care of a local authority. Since 1982 it has been possible
for agencies to offer prospective adoptive parents an allowance if this would help
to find a family for a child. Adoption is strictly regulated by legislation, and
SOCIAL WELFARE
149
Custodianship
Social Workers
adoption societies must be approved by the respective social services minister.
Local authorities can also provide an adoption service. The Registrars-General
keep confidential registers of adopted children. Adopted people may be given
details of their original birth record on reaching the age of 18, and counselling is
provided to help them understand the circumstances of their adoption. In
Northern Ireland the law on adoption is being reviewed to bring it broadly into
line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
Custodianship orders were introduced in 1985. A person who has cared for a
child for some time (for example, a foster parent, step-parent or relative) can
apply to a court for an order giving him or her the legal custody of the child. On
the making of such an order the custodian will have the parental rights and
duties of a natural parent and will be able to make decisions about a child’s
day-to-day care and upbringing, in the same way as a parent. Unlike an adoption
order, a custodianship order may be revoked. In Northern Ireland the law is
being reviewed to introduce custodianship provisions similar to those in the rest
of the United Kingdom.
The effective operation of the social services largely depends on the appointment
of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of social work.
Training courses in social work are provided by universities, polytechnics (in
Scotland, central institutions) and colleges of further education; their length
depends upon educational qualifications and previous experience and can
extend from one to four years. The Central Council for Education and Training
in Social Work recognises social work courses and offers advice to people
considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are mainly employed by the social services departments of local
authorities. Others work in the probation service, the education welfare service,
or in voluntary organisations.
A review of training for staff in residential homes, the changing role of
residential care and the range of services provided is in progress.
Voluntary Social Services
There is a long tradition in Britain of voluntary service to the community, and
the partnership between the voluntary and statutory sectors is encouraged by
the Government. It has been estimated that nearly a third of all adults take part
in some form of voluntary work during the course of a year. Local and health
authorities plan and carry out their duties taking account of the work of
voluntary organisations, and include them in the planning process. Voluntary
provision enables these authorities to continue the trend towards local
community care rather than institutional care for the elderly, the mentally ill
and mentally handicapped people.
An Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme, started by the Government in
1982, together with an Unemployed Voluntary Action Fund in Scotland and a
Community Volunteering Scheme in Northern Ireland, have provided support
for over 1,000 schemes by voluntary agencies to enable unemployed volunteers
to help disadvantaged groups in the community. Voluntary organisations also
participate in several other government schemes, including the Community
Programme, the Voluntary Projects Programme and the Youth Training Scheme.
Voluntary organisations derive their income from several sources including
voluntary contributions, central and local government grants, earnings from
commercial activities and investments. Some 450 bodies receive direct grants
150
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary
Organisations
from government health and social services departments; in 1984—85 these
amounted to some £30 million out of a total government funding of £224-4
million to voluntary organisations. Tax changes in recent budgets have helped
the voluntary movement to secure a larger flow of funds from industry.
Many voluntary organisations are charities, and in England and Wales the
Charity Commission, a government agency, gives free advice to trustees of
charities, initiating schemes to modernise their purposes or facilitate their
administration where necessary. The Commission also maintains a register of
charities, gives consent to land transactions by charities and holds investments
for them. Voluntary organisations may qualify for charitable status if they are
established for such purposes as the relief of poverty, the advancement of
education or religion or the promotion of certain other purposes of public
benefit including good community relations, the prevention of racial discrimina¬
tion, protection of health and the promotion of equal opportunity. The Charities
Aid Foundation, an independent body, aids the flow of funds to charity from
individuals, companies and grant-making trusts.
Co-ordination of government interests in the voluntary sector throughout
Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations concerned with health and
social welfare, ranging from national bodies to small individual local groups.
‘Self-help’ groups have been the most rapidly expanding part of the voluntary
sector in the last decade—examples include bodies which provide playgroups for
pre-school children, or help their members to cope with a particular disability.
Many organisations belong to larger associations or are represented on local or
national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly concerned with
giving personal service, others with the formation of public opinion and
exchange of information. Some carry out both functions. They may be staffed by
both professional and voluntary workers. While a majority of voluntary
organisations are concerned with social welfare in the ways described, there is a
growing interest among voluntary groups in cultural and environmental issues
and in participating in schemes to promote employment.
The main co-ordinating body in England, which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies, is the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations, which acts as a resource representative and develop¬
ment agency for the voluntary sector. It works to extend the involvement of
voluntary organisations in dealing with a broad range of social issues, to protect
the interests and independence of voluntary agencies, and to provide them with
a range of advice, information and other services. The Scottish Council for
Community and Voluntary Organisations, the Wales Council for Voluntary
Action and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action perform similar
functions.
The Volunteer Centre is a national voluntary organisation and centre for
information and research on voluntary work. There are many full-time and
part-time local volunteer bureaux which direct volunteers to opportunities for
voluntary service in both the voluntary and statutory sectors.
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned with personal and family
problems include the family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Associa¬
tion, Family Service Units and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisations;
the National Council for One Parent Families; Child Poverty Action Group and
the Claimants’ Union, both of which provide expert advice on social security
benefits; and the Samaritans, which helps the lonely, the depressed and the
suicidal.

Community service of many kinds is given by young people; this is often
channelled through national and local organisations such as Community
Service Volunteers, Scouts and Girl Guides, and the Time for God’ scheme run
by a group of churches.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which help people with
particular disabilities and difficulties include the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation, the Disabled Living Foundation, the Disablement
Income Group, MIND (National Association for Mental Health), MENCAP (Royal
Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults), the Spastics Society
Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their equivalents in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
National organisations whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on Social
Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society, the
Church of England Council for Social Aid, the Young Men’s Christian
Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council and the Jewish Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flats and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family
problems, and assists in hospitals and clinics and in emergencies.
Over 1,000 Citizens Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to people who
are in doubt about their rights or who do not know about the state or voluntary
services available. Some areas have law centres and housing advisory centres.
Social Security
The general aim of the social security programme is to provide an efficient and
responsive system of financial help for people who are elderly, sick, disabled,
unemployed, widowed or bringing up children. Certain benefits provide an
income for people who have no earnings because they are retired, unemployed or
sick. Others provide income for widows; assistance with extra expenses arising
from disablement; compensation for injury or disease caused at work or while in
the armed forces; and help with the cost of bringing up children. Alongside these
benefits there are certain means-tested benefits for people who have insufficient
means of support.
Social security benefits fall into two broad categories—contributory and
non-contributory. Contributory benefits are paid from the National Insurance
Fund, which consists of contributions from employed people and their
employers, self-employed people and the Government. Non-contributory benefits
are financed from general taxation revenue. Some are income-related for
example, supplementary benefit and housing benefit—but others, for example,
child benefit, are not, and entitlement depends solely on meeting the qualifying
conditions. Appeals relating to claims for the various benefits are decided by
independent tribunals.
Expenditure on social security has nearly doubled in real terms since 1970.
Part of the increase has been due to the rising numbers of the elderly, and part to
the growth in unemployment; much, however, has been due to real improve¬
ment in the level of benefits, the creation of new benefits and increased family
support.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers the services in
Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are administered by the Department of
152

CONTRI¬
BUTIONS
BENEFITS
Health and Social Services. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Advice on social security is
given to the Government by the Social Security Advisory Committee.
Over the 40 years since the basic structure of the present social security
system was established there have been many piecemeal changes and develop¬
ments, and the system has become very complex. As spending on the system
accounts for nearly one-third of all public expenditure, and pressures for
improvements and increased expenditure are bound to continue, the Govern¬
ment considered that a re-examination of the system was required, and in 1984
initiated a series of reviews. Following the reviews and publication in 1985 of a
consultative paper and a White Paper, Reform of Social Security: Programme for
Action, government proposals for a wide-ranging reform of the structure of the
system became law under the Social Security Act 1986. The main reforms, to be
introduced by April 1988, include the modification of the State Earnings-related
Pension Scheme, which is additional to the basic state pension, and new
arrangements to encourage personal and occupational pension schemes; the
introduction of a new range of income-related benefits to replace family income
supplement, supplementary benefit and housing benefit; and the creation of a
social fund to provide extra help for low-income families at times of special need
such as bereavement and maternity.
As part of its plans to improve the management of the social security system
and the quality of its service to the public, the Department of Healtl) and Social
Security is embarking on the biggest computerisation programme in Europe,
which aims to link all of its local and central offices and the local offices of the
unemployment benefit service into a single network.
At present, entitlement to National Insurance benefits such as retirement
pension, sickness and invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit, widow’s
benefit, maternity allowance, death grant and child’s special allowance is
dependent upon the payment of contributions. Industrial injuries benefits are
non-contributory, but are also payable from the National Insurance Fund. There
are four classes of contributions. Class 1 contributions, which are related to
earnings, are paid by employees and employers. The contribution is lower if the
employer operates a ‘contracted-out’ occupational pension scheme (see below).
Self-employed people pay a flat rate Class 2 contribution and a Class 4
contribution which is assessed as a percentage of profits or gains within certain
limits; they are not eligible for unemployment and industrial injuries benefits.
Voluntary Class 3 contributions are made by people wanting to safeguard rights
to some benefits.
Employees who continue working after pensionable age (60 for women and 65
for men) do not pay contributions but the employer continues to be liable. People
earning less than the lower earnings limit are not liable for contributions;
neither are their employers. Self-employed people with earnings below a set
annual amount may apply for exemption and those over pensionable age are
excused payment of contributions.
For most benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before benefit
can be paid at all, a certain number of contributions has to be paid; secondly,
the full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been made or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. Benefits are increased
annually, the uprating being linked to increases in retail prices. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates shown in Tables 5—9
are those effective until April 1987.
SOCIAL WELFARE
153
Retirement
Pension
Mothers and
Children
A state retirement pension is payable on retirement to women at the age of 60
and to men at the age of 65. (Legislation before Parliament would equalise the
retirement age for men and women in the same occupation. This, however,
would not affect the payment of state retirement pensions at different ages for
men and women.) At present, the state pension scheme consists of a basic
pension together with an additional earnings-related pension. Pensioners are
permitted to earn up to £75 a week before the amount of their pension is
reduced; those still ai work who have put off or cancelled their retirement during
the five years after minimum pension age may earn extra pension. A
non-contributory retirement pension is payable to people over the age of 80 who
meet certain residence conditions, and who have not qualified for a contributory
pension. People whose pensions do not give them sufficient resources to live on
may be entitled to supplementary pension, which is calculated on the same basis
as supplementary benefit (see p 156).
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from work
looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely disabled
relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with the same
earnings.
Employers are free to contract-out' their employees from the state scheme for
the additional earnings-related pension and to provide their own occupational
pension in its place, provided that the latter is at least as good as the state
additional pension. The State remains responsible for the basic pension. There
are at present around 90,000 occupational schemes, with some 11 million
members about half the working population. As part of a programme to reform
the occupational pensions system, the Government has introduced measures to
protect against inflation the pension rights of people who change jobs before
pension age; to give workers the right on leaving a scheme to a fair transfer
value; and (from November 1986) to require pension funds and other pension
schemes to provide access to more information about their schemes. The Social
Security Act 1986 gives all employees the right to choose a personal pension
rather than staying fully in the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme or in an
employer’s scheme. Such pensions would qualify for contracting out of the State
Earnings-related Pension Scheme and would enable people to choose from a
wide range of schemes available from banks, building societies and trusts.
At present, a non-contributoiy maternity grant of £25 is payable for each living
child born and for a stillborn child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks.
Contributory maternity allowance is a weekly benefit normally paid for 18 weeks,
starting 11 weeks before the baby is expected to women who have recently paid
full National Insurance contributions. A working mother is entitled to paid
maternity leave if she has been working for the same firm for at least two years
(five years in the case of part-time workers). The payment is calculated at 90 per
cent of weekly earnings, less the standard maternity allowance, and is paid for
the first six weeks of absence. From April 1987 maternity grant will be replaced
by a payment from the social fund, while maternity allowance and maternity pay
will be replaced by a statutory maternity scheme administered by employers.
Non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for children.
Tax free and normally paid to the mother, it is payable for children up to the age
of 16 and for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in full-time non-advanced
education. A sum in addition to child benefit, called one-parent benefit, is
payable to certain people, whether parents or not, bringing up one or more
children on their own. At present a weekly contributory child’s special allowance
is payable to a mother on the death of a former husband if the marriage was
dissolved or annulled and he was contributing to the support of the children. A
non-contributory guardian’s allowance for an orphaned child is payable to a
154
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Widows
Sick and

People
person who is entitled to child benefit for that child. In certain circumstances it
can be paid on the death of only one parent.
At present, a widow’s allowance may be payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood, and an additional sum is often payable for each child. After this a
widowed mother with a young family receives a widowed mother’s allowance
with an addition for each child. Widow’s pension is payable to a widow who is 40
years or over when her husband dies or when her entitlement to widowed
mother’s allowance ends. Payment continues until the widow remarries or
begins drawing retirement pension. Widows also benefit under the industrial
injuries scheme. Under the Social Security Act 1986 all widows will receive a
tax-free lump sum payment of £1,000 on bereavement, together with widowed
mother’s allowance or widow’s pension, and the age at which widow’s pension is
payable will be raised by five years. <
A man whose wife dies when both are over pension age inherits his wife’s
pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband's rights.
There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sickness
or disablement. Statutory sick pay with additions for a wife or other adult
dependants is payable by an employer for the first 28 weeks of an employee’s
illness. Employees not covered for statutory sick pay can claim sickness benefit
instead, as can self-employed people.
An invalidity pension with additions for a wife and children is payable when
statutory sick pay or sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary is still incapable of
work. An invalidity allowance may be paid with the pension to those people who
become sick more than five years before minimum retirement age. An additional
earnings-related pension may also be payable. A severe disablement allowance
may be payable to people of working age, including housewives, who are unable
to work and do not qualify for the National Insurance invalidity pension.
Various benefits are payable for disablement caused by an accident at work or
a prescribed disease. Disablement benefit is usually paid after a qualifying
period of 15 weeks if, as a result of an industrial accident or a prescribed
disease, there is a loss of physical or mental faculty. (During the qualifying
period sick pay or sickness benefit may be payable.) The amount depends on the
extent of the disablement as assessed by an adjudicating medical authority but
for disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid. In certain
circumstances disablement benefits may be supplemented by unemployability
supplement; constant attendance allowance; an additional allowance payable in
certain cases of exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance
for a person who is unfit to return to his or her regular job or to do work of an
equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance, which raises the
disablement pension or gratuity to the 100 per cent assessment rate during
hospital in-patient treatment for the industrial injury or disease. Increases of
disablement benefit for dependants may be payable with unemployability
supplement.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance allowance may be payable to severely
disabled people at either a higher or a lower rate depending upon the amount of
care and attention they require. An invalid care allowance may be payable to men
and women aged between 16 and pension age who cannot go to work because
they are caring for a severely disabled person receiving an attendance allowance.
Physically disabled people unable or virtually unable to walk may be entitled to
a tax-free mobility allowance to help to pay their transport costs. People aged
between 5 and 66 may claim and payment can continue up to the age of 75.
An independent organisation called Motability assists disabled drivers and
passengers wanting to use their mobility allowance to obtain a vehicle.

Unemployment
Benefit
Death Grant
Unemployment benefit is payable for up to a year in any one spell of unem¬
ployment. Periods covered by unemployment or sickness benefit, maternity
allowance or some training allowances, which are eight weeks or less apart, are
linked to form one period of interruption of employment. Generally anyone
claiming unemployment benefit has to be available for employment, but
unemployed people wishing to do voluntary work in the community can do so in
certain circumstances without loss of entitlement to benefit.
At present, a death grant is payable on the death of a contributor or a
contributor s near relative. It is normally £30 for an adult and a smaller sum for
a child. From April 1987 the death grant will be replaced by a grant from the
social fund.

people aged less than 60 who have received supplementary benefit or long-term
incapacity benefit continuously for one year, provided that the award is not
subject to the condition of being available for employment. Families receiving
supplementary benefit (as with family income supplement) are entitled to a
number of other benefits including housing benefit (see below), help with the
cost of spectacles, free school meals, milk and vitamins for expectant and
nursing mothers and for children under school age, and exemption from
National Health Service prescription charges and charges for dental treatment.
Lump sum payments may also be made for special needs such as clothing,
furniture and domestic appliances. The Social Security Act 1986 replaces
supplementary benefit by income support which will consist of a basic allowance
plus premiums for families, lone parents, pensioners and disabled people.
FAMILY
INCOME
SUPPLEMENT
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families with low incomes where
one of the parents is in full-time work and where there is at least one dependent
chrld. It is payable when the gross weekly income of a family falls below a
prescribed amount, which varies according to the number and ages of children
in the family but is the same for single- and two-parent families. ‘Full-time’ work
means, for the purpose of the benefit, work of at least 30 hours a week by either
parent in two-parent families or 24 hours a week for one-parent families. The
weekly rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family’s gross
income and the prescribed amount, up to a maximum figure depending on the
number and age of children in the family. The maximum payable for a family
with two children under 11, for example, would be £27-85. The Social Security
Act 1986 replaces family income supplement by a more generous family credit
paid to mothers.

Executive for tenants). Council (public sector) tenants may apply for a rent
rebate, and private tenants for a rent allowance. Both tenants and owner-
occupiers may apply for rate rebates. The amount of benefit depends on four
considerations: income; the amount of rent and rates paid; the size of the
family; and the presence of other people in the household. Benefit is worked out

expenses (the amounts are shown in Table 8), against income. Where income
equals the needs allowance, entitlement will be equal to 60 per cent of the eligible
rent and rates. This amount is progressively increased or decreased if income is
less than or greater than the needs allowance. Deductions from benefit are
usually made if a non-dependant lives in the same household. People receiving
supplementary benefit are entitled to a 100 per cent rebate or allowance of their
eligible rent and rates subject to certain deductions. The Social Security Act
1986 radically simplifies the present scheme.

WAR
PENSIONS
AND
RELATED
SERVICES
Pensions are payable to people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces
or by certain injuries received in the merchant navy or civil defence during
war-time, or to civilians injured by enemy action. The amount varies according
to the degree of disablement and rank; an allowance is paid for dependants.
There is a range of supplementary allowances, the main ones being for
unemployability, the need for constant attendance, the provision of extra
comforts, and as compensation for a lower standard of occupation. An age
allowance is payable to disabled pensioners aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more. Pensions are also paid to war widows and
orphans.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works closely with the many
voluntary and ex-Service organisations who give financial aid and personal help
to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
TAXATION
OTHER
BENEFITS
ARRANGE¬
MENTS
WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
Social security benefits, other than child, maternity, sickness, invalidity and
disablement benefit, are regarded as taxable income. Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of
dependants. The following benefits are not taxable: supplementary benefit
(except that paid to the unemployed), family income supplement, attendance
allowances, mobility allowance, war disability pensions including sup¬
plementary allowances, and war widow’s pension and allowances.
Other benefits for which unemployed people and those on low incomes may be
eligible include exemption from health service charges (see p 135), grants
towards the cost of spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid. Reduced
charges are often made to the unemployed, for example, for adult education and
exhibitions, and pensioners usually enjoy concessionary transport fares.
As part of the European Community’s efforts to promote the free movement of
abour, there are regulations providing for equality of treatment and the
protection of social security rights for employed and self-employed people
working in another member state. The regulations also cover retirement
pensioners and other beneficiaries who have been employed, or self-employed,
as well as dependants. Benefits affected include child benefit and those for
sickness and maternity, unemployment, retirement, invalidity, accidents at
work and occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security agreements with a number of other
countries. Their scope and the benefits they cover vary, but the majority cover
most National Insurance benefits and benefits for families.
7 Education
Policies
British education aims to develop fully the abilities of individuals, both young
and old, for their own benefit and that of society as a whole. Compulsory
schooling takes place between the ages of 5 and 16, although provision is made
for children under 5, and many pupils remain at school beyond the minimum
leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities, polytechnics and
colleges of further and higher education) is organised flexibly to provide a wide
range of opportunities for academic and vocational education and continuing
study throughout life. For many years the education service has been
characterised by change, and much of the post-1945 period has also been
marked by growth: large increases in the number of pupils, the expansion of
higher educational opportunities, and increased expenditure. Although the
process of change continues, recent years have seen increasing reassessment
and consolidation with a view to making the best use of resources in the light of
difficult economic circumstances and a substantial drop in the birth rate.
The overriding objectives of the Government's education policies are to raise
standards, ensure that education is attuned to the needs of industry and
commerce, and achieve better value for money throughout the education
system. In schools, standards of achievement are being raised by securing a
broader and more balanced curriculum for all pupils, reforming the public
examination system and improving the quality of teaching through better
teacher selection, training and deployment. Parental preference as to school and
the need for increased parental involvement in school organisation are receiving
close consideration while gifted children from less well-off homes are being given
the opportunity to attend certain independent schools.
Special attention is paid both to the provision of better pre-vocational
education and training in schools and colleges for the M- to 18-year-old
age-group, and to the 40 per cent of lower-attaining pupils in the final years of
compulsory education. It is recognised that co-operation between the education
system and industry can help young people to acquire the skills necessary to
maintain Britain's position as a leading industrial and trading nation. Many
organisations already work to improve such links, and further contacts are
being encouraged. An important objective has been to extend the knowledge and
use of microcomputers in schools.
In February 1986, the Government published a wide-ranging Education Bill
designed to raise educational standards in schools in England and Wales. The
new legislation was foreshadowed in a White Paper, Better Schools, published in
1985. The main aims of the Bill are to reform the composition of school
governing bodies and reallocate functions between school governors, local
education authorities and head teachers; provide for the appraisal of the
performance of teachers; and make in-service training of teachers more
elfective. In response to the report of an inquiry into the education of ethnic
minority groups the Government has described its policies for encouraging
children from the ethnic minorities to achieve their full potential.
A forecast decline of about one-third in the number of 18- to 21-year-olds by
the mid-1990s and the need to restrict government funding are among the
major factors which led the Government to review the future of higher

education. A White Paper incorporating proposals for the higher education
sector will be published before the end of 1986. A continuing aim is to encourage
institutions to improve their management and planning, and become more
flexible and responsive to the economic and social needs of the country. In line
with the concern to maintain British expertise in science, engineering and
technology, a shift in provision from the arts and social sciences towards these
subjects and towards directly vocational courses is occurring, while higher
education institutions and industry are being encouraged to collaborate more
closely for their mutual benefit. A number of science parks have been set up by
higher education institutions in conjunction with industrial scientists and
technologists to encourage the use of advanced technology. The Government
considers that access to higher education courses should be available to all those
who can benefit from them and who have the necessary intellectual competence,
motivation and maturity.
The already strong vocational element in many courses in the non-advanced
sector of further education (which comprises courses whose level is at or below
General Certificate of Education Advanced level or its equivalent) is also being
increased. The role played by further education institutions in providing
training and continuing education is of great importance, especially at a time of
increasing technological change and high unemployment.
One of the distinctive features of the education service is the large degree to
which responsibility for provision is decentralised. Overall responsibility for all
aspects of education in England, and for the Government’s relations with and
support for universities throughout Britain, rests with the Secretary of State for
Education and Science. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have responsibility in their respective countries for non¬
university education, and are consulted about education in universities.
The main concerns of the education departments (the Department of
Education and Science in England, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland) are
formulating national education policies, allocating resources and influencing
the other partners in the education service (the local education authorities,
governing bodies of educational institutions, the teaching profession, the
churches and voluntary organisations). The departments are also responsible
for the supply and training of all teachers.
The provision of maintained, that is, publicly financed, school education and
most post-school education outside universities is the responsibility of local
education authorities. They employ teachers and other staff, provide and
maintain buildings, supply equipment and materials and, in England and
Wales, provide grants to students proceeding to further and higher education.
Universities are self-governing institutions receiving most of their income from
central government grants. In Scotland the central institutions, which provide
most vocational higher education to degree level, and colleges of education,
which provide teacher training, are administered by independent governing
bodies. In Northern Ireland colleges of education are controlled by the
Department of Education or by voluntary agencies.
Planned spending on education in 1986—87 is some £17,500 million, about 10
per cent of public expenditure. More than four-fifths of this expenditure is
incurred by local authorities, which plan their spending according to local needs
and circumstances.
Reductions in spending by authorities on schools partially reflect the
declining number of schoolchildren, the removal of surplus school places, and
savings in the provision of school meals and milk. Additional provision is being

made to meet the cost of a large increase in the number of young people staying
on at school after 16.
Local education authorities are directly responsible for the funding of most
non-advanced further education courses. In order, however, to make training
and vocational education more relevant to employment needs, responsibility for
a quarter of the budget spent in England and Wales on work-related courses has
been placed with the Manpower Services Commission.
An education support grant scheme introduced in England and Wales in 1985
enables the Government to support local authority expenditure on educational
activities of national priority, such as improving the school curriculum,
methods of assessment, records of achievement and school management. In
1986-87 it is intended to provide £28 million out of total expenditure of £40
million on 16 projects.
Support for the universities and certain other higher education institutions,
and grants to students, account for most of the direct expenditure by central
government. About 80 per cent of universities' income comes from public funds,
the major part being recurrent grant paid by the Government to the University
Grants Committee, which allocates the funds to individual universities and
certain other institutions. The Committee also advises the Government on the
future development of the universities. The independent University of Bucking¬
ham receives no assistance from public funds although its students can apply
for mandatory grants.
Funds for advanced courses in polytechnics and other colleges of further
education maintained by local authorities are allocated centrally. The National
Advisory Body for Public Sector Higher Education advises the Government on
how these resources should be allocated in England: the Wales Advisory Body
has a similar function. There is no equivalent organisation in Scotland but the
Scottish Tertiary Education Advisory Council has general advisory functions.
Many universities, polytechnics and other higher education institutions
undertake training, research or consultancy for commercial firms, and the
Government is encouraging them to secure a larger flow of funds from these
sources. A number have endowments or receive grants or gifts from foundations
and benefactors. Local education authorities, through their further education
institutions, are empowered to sell goods and services arising as by-products of
educational activities.
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Some 9-7 million children attend Britain’s 36,500 schools. Most receive free
education financed from public funds, but a small proportion (roughly 6 per
cent) attend schools wholly independent of direct public financial support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools, and 86 per cent of
pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and Wales and 63 per cent in
Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools
are mixed. Most independent schools for younger children are co-edueational;
the majority providing secondary education are single-sex, although the number
of mixed schools is growing.
No fees are charged to parents of children at maintained schools, and books
and equipment are free, although in Northern Ireland a small proportion of
grammar school pupils is admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided and
maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds. Voluntary
schools, mostly established by religious denominations, are also wholly
164
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Nursery and
Primary
Schools
maintained from public funds but the governors of some types of voluntary
school contribute to capital costs. About a third of the 26,500 primary and
secondary schools supported by public funds in England and Wales are
voluntary schools, most of them Anglican or Roman Catholic. Each publicly
maintained school has a governing body, which includes governors appointed
by the local education authority and teacher and parent representatives. The
Government considers that the powers and duties at present exercised by
governing bodies give them too restricted a role in school management in
relation to that of the education authority or the head teacher. As part of its
strategy to improve standards, it proposes to change the composition of such
bodies and to extend their powers. The Education Bill provides for equal
numbers of parent and local authority governors, so that no single interest
predominates. In future, governing bodies would have responsibility for the
main policies of their schools, and for the preparation of a statement of their
schools' curricular aims and objectives. They would also have ultimate
responsibility for school discipline and a larger say in the appointment and
dismissal of staff.
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is
used for a type of independent school, see p 165). There is a statutory
requirement to establish school councils whose membership includes teachers,
parents, people interested in religious education, and in certain cases repre¬
sentatives of further education and of the community at large.
In Northern Ireland there are three main categories of grant-aided school:
controlled schools, owned and managed by the area education and library
boards and having all their expenditure met from public funds; voluntary
schools, mainly under Roman Catholic management and also maintained
largely by public funds: and voluntary grammar schools, which may be under
either Roman Catholic or non-denominational management and receive grants
from the Department of Education. Since the end of 1985 all grant-aided schools
have included elected parents and teachers on their boards of governors. It is
government policy to encourage integrated education, providing for both
Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils, where there is a local desire for it; a small
number of integrated schools have been opened with assistance from charitable
trusts.
In England, Wales and Scotland parents have a statutory right to express a
preference for a particular school for their children, and have an effective
channel of appeal at local level. Schools also have to publish basic information
about themselves and their public examination results.
Although there is no statutory requirement to provide education for the
under-fives, successive governments have expanded nursery education. Current
expenditure plans allow for the maintenance of existing levels of provision or a
small increase, mainly by converting surplus primary school accommodation to
nursery use. In England 43 per cent (and in Scotland 36 per cent) of three- and
four-year-olds receive education in nursery schools or classes or in infants'
classes in primary schools. In addition, many children (at least 40 per cent of
three- and four-year-olds) attend informal pre-school playgroups organised by
parents and voluntary bodies such as the Pre-School Playgroups Association.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales go
to infant schools or departments; at seven many go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age for transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but a number of local authorities in
England have established ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or 10 and
EDUCATION
165
Secondary
Schools
Independent
Schools
‘middle’ schools covering various age-ranges between 8 and 14. In Scotland the
primary schools take children from 5 to 12.
The publicly maintained system of education aims to give all children an
education suited to their particular abilities. About 90 per cent of the
maintained secondary school population in England and Wales attend compre¬
hensive schools, which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of a
district. The schools can be organised in a number of ways, including those that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose
pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or 14, leaving at 16 or
18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form
or a tertiary college for pupils over 16. Tertiary colleges provide a full range of
vocational courses for students over 16, as well as academic courses. Most other
children receive secondary education in ‘grammar’ or ‘secondary modern'
schools to which they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is almost completely non-selective; the majority
of schools are six-year comprehensives. Because of local circumstances there are
some comprehensive schools at which courses may last only four years or less;
pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth years to a six-year
comprehensive.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is organised largely along selective
lines, based on a system of testing. There are, however, certain areas where
secondary schools operate on a non-selective basis.
Independent schools are outside the publicly maintained sector, but they must
register with the appropriate education department and are open to inspection.
They can be required to remedy serious shortcomings in their premises,
accommodation or instruction and to exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or to be the proprietor of a school.
There are about 2,500 independent schools educating 550,000 pupils of all
ages. They charge fees, varying from about £100 a term for day pupils at nursery
age to £2,000 a term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer bursaries to help
pupils from less well-off families. Such pupils may also be helped by local
education authorities—particularly if the authorities' own schools cannot meet
the needs of individual children—or by the Government’s assisted places
scheme, under which assistance is given in relation to parental income (over
230 schools participate in the scheme). The Government also gives income-
related help with fees to pupils at certain specialist music and ballet schools.
There is great variety of provision within the independent sector, ranging
from small kindergarten to large boarding schools and from new and in some
cases experimental schools to ancient foundations. A number of independent
schools have also been established by religious and ethnic minorities. The 550
boys', girls' and mixed preparatory schools are so called because they prepare
children for the Common Entrance Examination to senior schools. The normal
age range is from seven-plus to 11, 12 or 13, but many of the schools now have
pre-preparatory departments for younger children.
Independent schools for older pupils—from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include
about 500 which are sometimes referred to as ‘public schools’. Today the term is
becoming less frequently used but refers to the mainly boys’ schools (which are
increasingly admitting girls) belonging to the Headmasters’ Conference and/or
the Governing Bodies Association and to schools in membership of the
Governing Bodies of Girls’ Schools Association. They should not be confused
with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.

Special
Educational
Needs
Teachers
The
Curriculum
Special educational needs embrace learning difficulties arising from emotional
or behavioural disorders as well as physical or mental handicap. Local education
authorities in England and Wales must ensure that children with special needs
are educated in ordinary schools provided that the parents' wishes have been
taken into account and that this is compatible with meeting the needs of the
child, with the provision of efficient education for the other children in the
school, and with the best use of resources. In Scotland, school placing is a
matter for agreement between education authorities and individual parents.
With the exception of mentally handicapped children, children with special
educational needs in Northern Ireland are provided for in the same way as in
England and Wales, although it is intended to introduce similar arrangements
for mentally handicapped children also.
There are almost 2,000 special schools (both day and boarding), including
those run by voluntary organisations, which cater for a wide variety of handicap.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or school governing bodies. There are about 545,000 teachers in
maintained and independent schools, and the overall pupil-teacher ratio in
primary and secondary schools is about 18-5 to 1. Teachers in these schools
must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate education department (see
p 174).
The content of the secular curriculum in maintained schools in England and
Wales is the responsibility of the local education authority and of the schools'
governors. In practice, responsibility is largely devolved on head teachers and
their staff. Under provisions contained in the Education Bill, head teachers
would be responsible for determining and organising the curriculum within
their schools, taking into consideration the policy of their local education
authority and that of their governing body. The Government is in favour of a
broad and balanced education which is relevant to the needs of the modern
world, and of widening educational opportunities as much as possible. It
considers that secondary pupils up to the age of 16 should follow a broad
curriculum including English, mathematics and science with elements of
physics, chemistry and biology; some study of the humanities including history;
religious and physical education; and both practical and aesthetic activities.
Most pupils should also study a foreign language. One aim of the Government’s
policy is to seek to ensure that girls do not limit their career prospects, as some
now do, by dropping the study of the physical sciences, design and technology,
and certain other subjects too early in their school education. A programme of
development projects has been introduced to provide a more effective education
with a practical slant for lower-attaining pupils who do not benefit fully from
existing courses. A large number of school-industry links schemes have been
initiated in recent years in order to improve liaison between schools and the
world of work.
In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main or
secondary medium of teaching in some schools. The content and management
of the curriculum in Scotland is the responsibility of education authorities and
individual head teachers though guidance is issued by the Scottish Education
Department. Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas. A
new curriculum structure for 14- to 16-year-olds has been established which
includes the compulsory study of English, mathematics and science. In 1984, as
part of a development programme for 16- to 18-year-olds, a flexible system of
vocational courses based on modules or short units of study was introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines ranging from business and administration to
engineering and industrial production. Though designed primarily to improve

and Vocational

the preparation of young people for working life, the courses are also intended to
meet the needs of many adults entering training or returning to education. The
courses lead to the award of a new National Certificate.
In Northern Ireland major programmes of curriculum review and development
are in progress in both primary and secondary schools. The objective in the
secondary sector is to improve the quality and relevance of education for all
pupils in the 1 l-to-16 age-range, with more emphasis on economic and political
awareness, technological understanding, personal development and the en¬
couragement of study skills. At the same time teaching methods are being
reconsidered.
Over the last 20 years much has been done by the educational authorities to
meet difficulties encountered by the ethnic minorities. English language
teaching has received priority, but attention has been increasingly directed at
the question of mother-tongue teaching. Emphasis has been placed on the need
for schools to take account of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of pupils.
Measures are being taken not only to improve the achievement of ethnic
minority pupils but also to prepare all children, not just those of ethnic minority
origin, for living in a multi-ethnic society.
In England and Wales curriculum development is promoted by the School
Curriculum Development Committee, in Scotland by the Consultative Commit¬
tee on the Curriculum and in Northern Ireland by the Council for Educational
Development. At some 500 teachers' centres in England and Wales, teachers
meet for curriculum development work, discussion and in-service training.
A growing recognition of the need to equip pupils of all abilities with the skills
needed by modern commerce and industry led the Government to launch the
Technical and Vocational Education Initiative in England and Wales in 1983
and in Scotland in 1984. The scheme, consisting of a series of pilot projects
devised and managed by local education authorities, is funded and adminis¬
tered by the Manpower Services Commission. Projects provide general, technical
and vocational education for some 40,000 young people aged 14 to 18 leading to
nationally recognised qualifications. The pilot scheme is to be extended into a
national scheme in 1987.
Great importance is attached to the acquisition and use of computers by
schools, in view of the growing importance to the economy and society of
information technology. As a result of the Government’s Micros in Schools and
Micros in Primaries schemes, every secondary and almost all primary schools in
Britain now have at least one microcomputer and the average in secondary
schools is now 13 (making a total of about 100,000 machines). A six-year
Microelectronics Education Programme (MEP) in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland which began in 1980, and the separate Scottish Microelectronics
Development Programme (SMDP), aimed to give young people a better under¬
standing of the new technology and its applications. With the ending of the MEP
in March 1986 a new Microelectronics Education Support Unit has been set up
to assist the work of local education authorities. Priority is being given to
curriculum development (especially in subjects such as science, mathematics,
crafts, design and technology) including the production and supply of more and
better computer software; in-service teacher training; and the provision of
information.
For three years from 1985 special funds are being made available to promote
the use of educational software in schools. Britain has developed a world lead in
several aspects of computer education and the large number of countries which
have bought British educational software, signed licensing agreements or
purchased consultancy services from the MEP and its successor or SMDP

include India, Australia, Mexico, Israel, the United States, Tunisia, Canada, the
Netherlands and Belgium.
British School Technology, an independent education centre to promote the
teaching of technology in secondary schools and colleges, has been developed
with funding of £2-5 million over three years (beginning in 1984) from the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Manpower Services Commission.
The centre provides help to local education authorities wanting to introduce
courses into their schools, assists in training teachers, co-operates with
examination boards to assess new courses, and assists new firms planning to
produce equipment for British schools and for export.
In England and Wales all children in county or voluntary schools receive
religious education by law and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schdols, and sometimes in
voluntary schools, non-denominational religious instruction is given in accord¬
ance with a locally agreed syllabus which may include the study of comparative
religions. Syllabuses have been revised in many areas to take account of the
faiths of the local population. In all kinds of voluntary schools there is the
opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland religious instruction
must be given, the content being determined by education authorities and
schools in accordance with the wishes of the local community. Certain schools
provide for Roman Catholic children but in all schools there are safeguards for
the individual conscience. In controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a
right of access which may be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary
schools corporate worship and religious education are controlled by the
management authorities.
At present the principal examinations taken by secondary school pupils in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland at the age of 16 and over are those leading
to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) at Ordinary (O) level and to the
Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE). Both are normally taken after five
years of secondary education. The GCE Advanced (A) level is normally taken after
a further two years' study. The highest grade (grade 1) in the CSE is accepted as
equivalent to the standard of a higher grade pass (grades A to C) at GCE O-level,
and these are the qualifying grades for entry to further education and training.
The A-level examination is the standard for entrance to university and other
higher education, and to many forms of professional training. Entries for GCE
examinations are also accepted from private candidates and those attending
further education establishments. Pupils take on average five or more O-levels
and two or three A-levels. The numbers achieving success in these examinations
have increased considerably in recent years, and fewer than one in ten pupils left
school without a single graded result in 1984. In 1984 nearly 27 per cent of
school leavers achieved five or more higher grades at O-level or CSE (grade 1),
while 17 per cent achieved at least one A-level.
In order to improve examination courses and raise standards of performance,
the Government decided to replace GCE O-level and CSE examinations by a
single qualification, the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE);
two-year courses leading to the new qualification were introduced in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland in the autumn of 1986. GCSE syllabuses and
assessment procedures will comply with nationally agreed guidelines, known as
national criteria. The main objective of this and other policies is to bring 80 to
90 per cent of all pupils at least to the level achieved by pupils of average ability in
individual subjects (CSE grade 4), and to do this over a broad range of skills and
competence in a number of subjects. The Government will introduce from 1989
another new examination, the Advanced Supplementary (AS) level, to be taken
EDUCATION
169
Records of
Achievement
alongside existing A-levels. The AS level, the first courses for which will begin in
1987, will provide an opportunity for sixth-form pupils to study a wider range of
subjects than at present; students specialising in the arts and humanities, for
example, would be able to continue the study of mathematics and technological
subjects at the new level.
The Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education, a new qualification awarded for
the first time in 1986, is intended for those at school or college who wish to
continue in full-time education for a year after the age of 16 to prepare either for
work or for vocational courses. It is being devised by the Business & Technician
Education Council and the City and Guilds of London Institute (see p 174).
The Secondary Examinations Council has been established to co-ordinate and
supervise systems of examination and assessment in England and Wales
designed principally for pupils in secondary education.
The public examination system in Scotland is different from that in other
parts of Britain. Scottish pupils take the Scottish Certificate of Education (SCE)
at Ordinary grade at the end of their fourth year of secondary education
(equivalent to the fifth year in England and Wales). Pupils in the fifth and sixth
years sit the SCE Higher grade, and passes at this grade are the basis for entry to
university, college of education or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
Reforms of the examination system are already under way in Scotland. New
Standard grade courses and examinations were introduced in 1984 and will
eventually replace the Ordinary grade. Standard grade courses will cater for the
whole ability range with syllabuses at three levels—Foundation, General and
Credit and all pupils will be assessed in examinations against nationally
determined standards of performance. The Higher and post-Higher examina¬
tions are also being revised to ensure compatibility with the new Standard
grade.
Under the Government s plan for the reform of non-advanced further
education in Scotland, the National Certificate was introduced in 1984—85 for
students over 16 who had successfully completed a programme of vocational
courses based on study units known as modules (see p 166).
The Government has decided that all pupils in England and Wales should, by the
end of the decade, be issued with a written record of their school achievements
and performance when they leave school; this would reflect achievements across
the whole educational programme of the school going beyond examination
results.

Her Majesty's Inspectors report to ministers on the quality of education provided
in all schools (and in most further education establishments outside the
universities) and advise local education authorities, schools and the Govern¬
ment; their reports on individual establishments are published (except in
Northern Ireland). Local education authorities also employ inspectors or
advisers to guide them on maintained schools.
The Assessment of Performance Unit of the Department of Education and
Science promotes the development of methods of assessment and monitors the
achievement of schoolchildren. Programmes of monitoring have been under¬
taken in English language and mathematics at the ages of 11 and 15, in science
at the ages of 11, 13 and 15, and in the first foreign language at the age of 13. A
survey of performance at the age of 15 in design and technology is to be
undertaken in 1988.
Teachers and pupils use a range of aids to assist the processes of teaching and
learning. Most schools have audio-visual equipment such as slide projectors and

overhead projectors, and educational broadcasting is of major importance. Each
year more than 600 hours of school radio and 1,000 hours of television are
transmitted by the BBC and the independent broadcasting companies.
Teachers’ notes, pupils’ pamphlets and computer software accompany many
broadcast series. Virtually all primary and secondary schools are now equipped
with microcomputers which are used for computer-assisted learning (see
p 167).
The autonomous Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom
is the central organisation for promoting the application of audio-visual,
technological and other aids to education and training.
Increasing importance is being attached by schools (and by further education
establishments) to careers education to increase young people’s awareness of
further education and careers opportunities and generally help them to prepare
for post-school life. The work of careers officers at local level is supported by
careers information material produced by the Government’s Careers and
Occupational Information Centre. The Government is sponsoring the develop¬
ment of a computer-assisted careers guidance system for students in universi¬
ties, polytechnics and colleges.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the core curriculum of
all maintained schools, and playing fields must be available for pupils over the
age of eight. Most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The government health departments are responsible for the medical inspec¬
tion of schoolchildren and for advice on, and treatment of, specific medical and
dental problems associated with children of school age. The Government
believes that the education service has a key role to play in preventing and
dealing with juvenile drug misuse, and it is encouraging teachers to help to
tackle this problem.
Local education authorities are free to decide what milk, meals or other re¬
freshment to provide at their schools, and what charges to make. (In Northern
Ireland, school meals must be provided.) Provision has to be made free of charge,
however, for pupils from families receiving certain social security benefits.
Under certain conditions the authorities must provide free school transport,
and they have discretionary powers to assist with the cost of travel to school.
Post-school education for young people above school-leaving age is provided at a
range of levels. More than a third of young people receive some form of
post-school education, compared with a fifth in 1965, while some 14 per cent of
young people in the 18-year-old age-group entered full-time higher education
courses (that is, first degree, postgraduate and other advanced courses of a
standard higher than GCE A-level) in 1985. The number of degrees awarded per
age-group is comparable with that of other developed countries and the
proportion of people in all further and higher education also compares well,
taking into account the large proportion of part-time students and the large
group of students receiving professional training in firms rather than in
educational institutions.
Post-school education is provided at universities, polytechnics, the Scottish
central institutions and other publicly maintained or assisted colleges; the latter
have a variety of titles including colleges of higher or further education, colleges
of technology, colleges of art, agricultural colleges and adult education centres.
There are also many independent specialist establishments, such as secretarial
and correspondence colleges and colleges for teaching English as a foreign
language. A number of voluntary and public bodies provide cultural and general

education, sometimes with assistance from local education authorities and
central government, and many education and training schemes are run by
public or private organisations, or firms.
The Government is seeking to improve awareness of the opportunities for
further education and training through the development of national informa¬
tion services, such as the Educational Counselling and Credit Transfer
Information Service funded by the Department of Education and Science.
Higher education, in the form of degree and other post-A-level advanced
courses, is provided by universities, polytechnics, the Scottish central institu¬
tions and institutions ol further and higher education, some concerned wholly
with teacher training. Reduced public expenditure on higher education has
necessitated some restructuring of courses and departments in universities and
other colleges. However, a decline in the intake of new students by universities
in the years 1981-83 has now been reversed, and expansion elsewhere meant
that in 1984-85 there were 51,000 more full-time home students in higher
education than in 1980-81. One of the Government’s main objectives in higher
education is to bring about a change in the balance of provision in favour of
scientific, technological and directly vocational courses.
In order to maintain British expertise in information technology and related
fields, a three-year initiative was launched in 1982 to expand higher education
and research in electronics, engineering and computer science by providing
5,000 extra student places, and additional staff and research fellowships in
universities, polytechnics and Scottish central institutions. Under a separate
scheme, some 950 researchers and lecturers have been appointed, mostly in the
natural sciences and technology. The Engineering and Technology Programme
announced in 1985 will, when fully operational, provide a further 5,000 student
places in engineering, information technology and related scientific disciplines.
The term further education' is generally used to define all post-school
education other than higher education, and comprises non-advanced courses
(of A-level standard or below). Non-advanced and some advanced courses are
provided by 740 colleges of further education, almost all of them controlled by
local education authorities. Non-advaneed courses are also provided by adult
education centres.
Much of the provision outside the universities is broadly vocational in
purpose; it extends from lower-level technical and commercial courses to
advanced courses for those aiming at higher-level posts in commerce, industry
and administration, or taking up a variety of professions (for example
town planning or estate management). The system is flexible and permits the
student to acquire whatever qualifications his or her capabilities and time
allow.
A large proportion of students on non-advanced courses attend part time,
either by day release or block release from employment or during the evenings. A
particular feature of the further education system is its strong ties with
commerce and industry: some two-thirds of spending in the non-advanced
sector, for example, is devoted to work-related studies. Co-operation with the
business world is encouraged by the Government and its agencies, and
employers are often involved in designing courses. A series of College-Employer
Links Projects, launched in 1984, help colleges to meet the education and
training needs of local firms by identifying the particular skills and qualifica¬
tions required by employers and developing ways of providing them. Further
education colleges provide much of the education element in industrial training
programmes like the Youth Training Scheme and the Training Opportunities
Scheme, both sponsored by the Manpower Services Commission. The former
scheme offers the opportunity of two years’ planned work experience and
training to 16-year-old school-leavers and one year’s to 17-year-old school-

leavers; the latter provides people aged 19 and over with the opportunity to
acquire new skills.
Some 972,000 students were taking full-time courses in 1984-85, including
sandwich courses (where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with
periods of supervised experience on a relevant job), at universities and major
establishments of further education in Britain. Of these about 292,000 were at
universities while another 274,000 were following advanced courses outside
universities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics and
Scottish central institutions. More than 406,000 take non-advanced courses,
most of them studying for recognised vocational or educational qualifications.
There were also about 3-2 million part-time students, over 542,000 of whom
are released by their employers for further education during working hours.
Many of the remainder take part in adult education classes.
Over 90 per cent of full-time students on advanced courses are helped by
grants from public funds, which are mandatory for those students taking first
degree and other comparable courses who qualify under national rules. (Grants
for other courses may be given at the discretion of a local education authority.)
Grants cover tuition fees and maintenance, but parents contribute to main¬
tenance costs according to their income. They are awarded by local education
authorities in England and Wales up to first degree level; equivalent schemes are
administered in Scotland by the Scottish Education Department, and in
Northern Ireland mainly by the education and library boards. For postgraduate
study and research, grants are offered by the education departments and the
research councils. Some scholarships are available from endowments and from
particular industries or companies.
There are 46 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. They are governed by royal charters or in some cases by Act of
Parliament, and enjoy complete academic freedom, appointing their own staff
and deciding which students to admit, what and how to teach, and which
degrees to award. The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath,
Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London),
Durham, East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, York and the independent University of Buckingham.
The Royal College of Art, the Cranfield Institute of Technology, the London
Graduate School of Business Studies and the Manchester Business School also
have university status. The federated University of Wales comprises seven
constituent institutions. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St Andrews, Stirling and
Strathclyde (Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there are the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the University of Ulster.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination or selection. Of the 292,000
full-time university students in 1984—85 (excluding those at the Open
University and the University of Buckingham), about 47,500 were postgraduate.
About half lived in colleges, halls of residence and other accommodation owned
by universities.
There are some 30,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly from
EDUCATION
173
university funds. The ratio of staff to students is about one to ten, one of the
most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first degree courses are mainly full time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses usually
require five or six years. Degree titles vary according to the practice of each
university; in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the most common titles for a
first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a
second degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of
Philosophy (PhD); in Scotland Master is used for a first degree in arts subjects.
Uniformity of standards between universities is promoted by the practice of
employing external examiners for all university examinations, and the general
pattern of teaching is fairly similar throughout Britain.
Research is an important feature of university work; many staff combine
research with their teaching duties and about half of postgraduate students are
engaged on research projects.
The Open
University
Polytechnics
and Other
Institutions
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using mainly a combination of correspondence
courses, television and radio broadcasts, and summer schools, together with a
network of study centres for contact with part-time tutors and counsellors and
with fellow students. No formal academic qualifications are required to register
for these courses, but the standards of the University’s degrees are the same as
those of other universities. Its first degree, for which courses began in 1971, is
the BA (Open), a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. The University also has a programme of higher degrees, BPhil, MPhil
and PhD, available through research, and MA and MSe through taught courses.
In 1983, courses started for English-speakers in Belgium, and the University
has advised many other countries on the setting-up of similar institutions. A
Continuing Education Programme, including short courses of community
education, in-service training for teachers and other staff, and up-dating
courses for managers, scientists and technologists, is the fastest-growing aspect
of the University’s work. In 1986 some 140,000 students were following Open
University courses, more than half at degree level.
A major contribution to post-school education in England and Wales is made by
the 30 polytechnics which have been established since 1967. They provide
courses in a wide range of subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a
concentration on advanced work. Courses may lead to first and higher degrees,
certain graduate-equivalent qualifications, the examinations of the main
professional bodies, and to qualifications such as those of the Business &
Technician Education Council (see p 174). One-year ‘access’ courses provide a
foundation and an appropriate test before enrolment on a course of higher
education for prospective students who lack the standard entry qualifications.
Polytechnics have close links with commerce and industry, and many
polytechnic students have jobs and attend on a part-time basis. Similar
provision is made in Scotland in the 16 central institutions and a number of
iurther education colleges, and in Northern Ireland by the University of Ulster.
Institutes and colleges of higher education, formed by the integration of
teacher training with the rest of higher education, also account for a significant
proportion of higher education students, and other further education colleges
run some, usually specialised, higher education courses.
Initial plans were announced in 1984 for the establishment of Britain’s first
independent institute of information technology, to be funded mainly by
sponsorship from British electronics manufacturers and users. The institute
would be located in Milton Keynes, to the north-west of London.

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An increasing proportion of students on advanced courses in Great Britain
outside the universities are taking courses leading to the qualifications of the
Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council awards degrees
and other academic qualifications comparable in standard with those granted
by the universities. The courses range from science and technology to the
arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the proportion of technologi¬
cal, business or other broadly vocational courses is much higher than in
universities.
The Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC) plans and administers a
unified national system of courses at technician or equivalent level for students
in industry, commerce and public administration in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Courses leading to BTEC awards are available at polytechnics,
colleges of further and higher education, and in some schools. The Scottish
equivalent of the Council is the Scottish Vocational Education Council, which is
also the awarding body for the non-advanced National Certificate in Scotland.
A National Council for Vocational Qualifications will be established in autumn
1986; it will devise a new system of qualifications within a framework to be
called the National Vocational Qualification, which is to be put into operation by
1991.
Qualifications in a wide range of craft skills are offered by the City and Guilds
of London Institute, and a variety of qualifications in commercial and office
practice are awarded by the Royal Society of Arts.
All entrants to teaching in England and Wales must have taken a recognised
course of teacher training. Courses are offered by institutes of higher education,
most universities, many polytechnics and by certain other colleges. Non¬
graduates usually qualify by way of three- or four-year courses leading to the
Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree; graduates take a one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority schools must be registered
with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. It is government policy that all
entrants to the teaching profession in Scotland should be graduates. New
primary teachers qualify either through a four-year BEd course or a one-year
postgraduate course of teacher training at a college of education. Teachers of
academic subjects at secondary schools must hold a degree containing two
passes in the subject which they wish to teach. In certain non-academic
subjects, a relevant specialist diploma has been acceptable in place of a degree,
but this provision is being phased out.
In Northern Ireland teacher training is provided by the two universities and
the two colleges of education. The principal courses are BEd (three- or four-year
honours), BA and BSc with education (three, four or five years) and the one-year
Certificate of Education for graduates.
The number of teachers to be trained to teach in primary schools is being
greatly increased in order to meet the anticipated rise in the number of primary
schoolchildren over the next few years. There will also be more admissions to
undergraduate courses of initial training for teachers of certain subjects in
secondary schools, including those subjects (like mathematics and physics)
where there have been long-standing shortages. Admissions to postgraduate
training courses for secondary teachers, the route by which about three-
quarters of all newly trained secondary teachers qualify, are due to remain at the
present level until 1990.
The Government is taking steps to improve the quality of teaching by revising
selection, training and placement procedures for new teachers, and by providing
more in-service training opportunities. Management training courses for head
EDUCATION
175
Adult and
Continuing
Education
teachers are also being provided. The Government believes that more systematic
planning is required by schools and local education authorities to match
in-service training to both the career needs of teachers and to the curricular
needs of schools; the Education Bill contains provisions to make such training
more effective in England and Wales.
Since 1983-84 a system of in-service training grants has operated to
stimulate training in selected priority areas. In 1986-87 three new subjects will
be included in England and Wales: training to assist school teachers to respond
to ethnic diversity; microelectronics in schools; and management training for
teachers in further education. In addition, a special programme will be initiated
to support the introduction of the General Certificate of Secondary Education.
In Scotland the main priorities for 1986—87 are training in technological
education and in combating drug misuse.
Measures taken to strengthen initial teacher training in England and Wales
have included the establishment of a Council for the Accreditation of Teacher
Education to review all existing courses and to issue new criteria against which
courses can be assessed. The Education Bill gives the Government powers to
require local education authorities to appraise the performance of teachers. In
Scotland, following recommendations of working parties on teacher training,
postgraduate courses are being revised. All new pre-service and major in-service
courses provided by colleges of education must be approved both by the Scottish
Education Department and a validating body.
It is becoming increasingly recognised that education is a process which
continues throughout adult life. The scope of adult and continuing education
has widened in recent years and now includes, in addition to the development of
the individual through cultural, physical and craft pursuits, such subjects as
basic education (for example, in literacy and numeracy); education for disadvan-
taged groups and those with special needs such as ethnic minorities or the
disabled; consumer education; health education; and pre-retirement education.
Continuing education also includes training for those in employment to enable
them to keep pace with technological change. The Government has taken a
number of recent initiatives to improve opportunities for both adult and
continuing education. In 1982 it launched a Professional, Industrial and
Commercial Updating Programme (PICKUP), designed to help colleges,
polytechnics and universities to meet the need to up-date and broaden the skills
of those in mid-career in industry, commerce and the professions. A programme
to encourage the expansion of educational opportunities for the adult unem¬
ployed, called REPLAN, was launched in 1984. A new ‘college of the air’, bringing
together broadcasters, educationists and sponsors, will provide, from 1987
onwards, vocational education and training courses below degree level.
Apart from provision for mature students at universities, courses are provided
by further education colleges, adult education centres, residential colleges,
extra-mural departments of universities, the Open University and various other
bodies including a number of voluntary organisations. Most of the provision is
made by the local education authorities in a wide variety of establishments,
including schools used for adult evening classes and ‘community schools’ which
provide educational, social and cultural opportunities for the wider community.
Most courses are part time. Local authorities also maintain or aid many of the
short-term residential colleges or centres which provide courses lasting between
a weekend and a fortnight. Long-term residential colleges, grant-aided by central
government departments, provide courses of one or two years and aim to provide
a liberal education without academic entry tests. Most students admitted are
entitled to full maintenance grants.

tion, the largest recognised voluntary body, provide extended part-time courses
of liberal studies; they also run short courses for special (including vocational)
interests. Various kinds of education and training are provided by a wide range
of other organisations, including the National Federation of Women’s Institutes,
the Young Men’s Christian Association and the Pre-Retirement Association.
The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education is a centre of
information, research, development work and publication for adult and
continuing education, as well as a channel of co-operation and consultation for
the many interested organisations in England and Wales. The Institute also
administers with government funding the Unit for the Development of Adult
Continuing Education which undertakes research and development work; the
Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, covering proficiency in literacy, numeracy
and communications skills; and a large part of the REPLAN programme. The
Institute’s counterpart in Scotland is the Scottish Institute of Adult and
Continuing Education.
In Scotland the Scottish Community Education Council advises the Govern¬
ment and promotes all community education matters including adult literacy
and basic education and the youth service.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Continuing Education advises the
Department of Education on adult and continuing education matters.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses of higher
education remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars and tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work or work experience. Educational aids are widely used.
Radio and television programmes, both specifically educational and general,
are important media for continuing education and are often linked to a range of
supplementary publications, courses and activities. The BBC, the independent
television companies and Channel 4 provide programmes which range from
basic education and progressive vocational training to domestic, social and craft
skills. The BBC also works with the Open University (see p 173), producing and
broadcasting radio and television programmes as part of the University’s
courses.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by central and local government,
the Economic and Social Research Council, philanthropic organisations,
universities and other higher education institutions, teachers’ associations and
certain independent bodies.
The major research institute outside the universities is the autonomous
National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales, with
income mainly from funds received from research projects and from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers' organisations and
universities; it also receives a small government grant. The Scottish Council for
Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for Educational
Research have similar functions.
Schoolchildren, students, teachers and others concerned with education come
to Britain from overseas to study, and British people work and train overseas.
Many opportunities for such movement are the result of international co¬
operation at government level within the European Community and within the
Commonwealth, and of educational schemes, courses and professional contacts
organised in Britain by officially funded and voluntary organisations. The
British aid programme encourages links between educational institutions in
Britain and developing countries.

177
British membership of the European Community is creating closer ties with
other member countries. Both in schools and in the colleges and universities
there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and languages,
and exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and students take place.
Britain has adhered to the Statute of the European Schools (nine of which
have been established throughout the Community including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire) to provide education for children of people employed in Community
institutions.
Overseas
Students in
Britain
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training.
British universities, polytechnics and other further education establishments
have built up their reputation overseas by offering tuition of the highest
standards, maintaining low student-to-staff ratios, and providing courses and
qualifications to meet present-day and possible future needs. First degree
courses tend to be shorter and more intensive than in many other countries
(three years is the normal length in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; three
or four years in Scotland).
In the academic year 1984-85 there were about 35,000 overseas students at
universities and 21,000 at polytechnics and other establishments of further and
higher education. In addition, many thousands of people from abroad were
training for such occupations as nursing, law, banking and accountancy, and
service and other industries. About half of all overseas students were from the
Commonwealth and Britain's dependencies. Many come to Britain for advanced
training: some 30 per cent of students enrolled for full-time postgraduate study
or research in Britain in 1984—85 came from overseas.
Most overseas students pay their own fees and expenses or hold awards from
their own governments. Those following courses of higher or further education
are charged fees which cover the full cost of their courses. Nationals of other
member countries of the European Community are generally charged the lower
level of fees that applies to British students.
The Government continues, however, to make considerable provision for
students and trainees from developing countries under its overseas aid
programme. Some 12,150 were financed in 1985 under regional programmes of
technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, and under British Council schemes. Expenditure on overseas
students (including some studying overseas) totalled £62 million. The Govern¬
ment increased its financial support for overseas students by £46 million over
the three years 1983—84 to 1985—86, using the money to finance a number of
new measures including provision for some five to six thousand additional
scholarships and awards each year. Under a new Overseas Development
Administration Shared Scholarship Scheme, launched in 1986-87, 750 awards
over five years are available mainly at postgraduate level for students from the
developing countries of the Commonwealth, with costs being shared between
the Government and the educational institutions.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme,
funded by the Department of Education and Science, provides assistance for
overseas research students of high ability to attend British universities while
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Scholarships and Awards Scheme, which
operates in some 90 countries, is designed to benefit individuals likely to hold
positions of responsibility in their future careers.
Many public and private scholarships and fellowships are available to students
from overseas (and to British students who want to study overseas). Among the
best known are the British Council Scholarships, the Commonwealth Scholar¬
ship and Fellowship Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the Marshall
178
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Language
Educational

Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, and the Churchill Scholarships for men
and women in all walks of life. Most British universities and colleges offer
scholarships for which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
A number of British colleges of further education have entered into arrange¬
ments with British universities to provide courses for overseas students before
they enter university.
The continuing increase in interest in English as a foreign language is reflected
in the growth of the number of private language schools in Britain and the larger
proportion of these recognised by the British Council. At the same time the
British Council has expanded the volume of its own teaching of English overseas
by opening several new centres and extending existing ones, and runs a
programme for teaching English related to specific jobs and skills. Publications
and other material relating to English language teaching have also increased in
number and are now a large component in many publishers' lists, constituting a
major export.
The BBC’s English by Radio and English by Television services provide a
world-wide facility for the individual learner at home.
The promotion of cultural and educational relations with other countries is a
major concern of the British Council, which plays an important part in the
management of the aid programme to education. It recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short visits overseas by British experts, and encourages
cultural exchange visits. It also runs schemes to promote academic interchange
between universities and higher education institutions in Britain and other
countries, and exchange schemes in other scientific, educational and cultural
areas. Co-operation between universities in Britain and developing countries is
promoted by means of recruiting staff for overseas universities, the secondment
of staff from British universities, interdepartmental faculty link schemes, local
staff development, short-term teaching and advisory visits, and general consul¬
tancy services.
The Central Bureau, a charitable foundation financed by the Government,
aims to enrich British education through international contact and exchange. It
is responsible, with the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers,
for teacher exchanges with various West European and Commonwealth
countries and the United States. It develops links and exchanges between
schools, further education establishments and local authorities, and organises
study visits for teachers, education administrators and young workers. It also
administers the Language Assistant Scheme in Britain and provides an
information service on aspects of educational exchange. In 1985 the Central
Bureau and the British Council set up, at the Government’s request, the Youth
Exchange Council which develops, implements and evaluates policy on youth
exchanges between Britain and other countries.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities promotes co-operation be¬
tween member universities in 29 Commonwealth countries. It organises
meetings, provides information and academic appointments services, adminis¬
ters the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan in Britain, and
generally promotes the movement of academic and administrative staff and of
students from one country to another.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The
United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body
serving overseas students, and organisations and individuals concerned in
student affairs.

The Youth Service
The youth service forms part of the education system and is concerned with
promoting the personal development and social education of young people by
providing opportunities for them to participate in a wide range of leisure-time
activities. Young people take part in the youth service on a voluntary basis.
Extending the range of experiences open to young people and giving them
opportunities to participate in the running of their organisations are seen as key
elements in the provision.
The youth service is a partnership between central government, local
authorities and voluntary youth organisations; at local level the youth service is
provided by voluntary organisations and local education authorities. Govern¬
ment education departments formulate broad policy objectives and encourage
their achievement through financial assistance and advice. The need to achieve
better planning, management and co-ordination of the youth service in
England, which was emphasised in an official review published in 1982, has
been endorsed by the Government. In 1985 the Government established the
National Advisory Council for the Youth Service for England and Wales to advise
ministers and others on the scale and direction of youth service activity. In
Wales the Youth Work Partnership was set up in 1985 to promote the
co-ordination and development of services there.
National voluntary youth organisations promote the major share of youth
activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day expenses by
their own efforts. Many receive financial and other assistance from local
education authorities, which also provide facilities in many areas. The voluntary
organisations vary greatly in character and include the uniformed and church
organisations. Many local authorities and voluntary youth organisations have
responded to new needs in society by making provision, for example, for the
young unemployed, young people from the ethnic minorities, young people in
inner cities or rural areas and those in trouble or especially vulnerable. Other
areas of concern are homelessness, work with girls, and provision for
handicapped young people. Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisa¬
tions are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 530,000 and
736,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (about 700,000),
the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 174,000), the Young Men’s
Christian Association (750,000) and clubs run by the churches. The Young
Farmers Clubs are distinguished as a movement in which decisions are taken
by the members themselves. There are also organisations like the Outward
Bound Trust providing opportunities for adventurous outdoor pursuits. The
three pre-service organisations (the Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air
Training Corps), with a membership of some 100,000, undertake activities
related to the work of the armed forces. Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are represented, and employ youth
officers to co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-service training. There are
also youth councils which are representative bodies of young people from local
youth organisations. At national level many voluntary organisations belong to
the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, a representative and
consultative body which aims to develop the partnership between voluntary and
statutory bodies in England. Similar councils exist in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The British Youth Council is a national forum for young
people, youth organisations and youth councils, including the youth wings of
the major political parties, and represents young people at an international level.
The youth service in England and Wales can draw on information, advice,
training and research services provided by the National Youth Bureau, which is
funded primarily by central government and issues a range of publications.

In England and Wales a basic two-year training course at certain universities
and higher education colleges leads to the status of qualified youth and
community worker. A number of Bachelor of Education degree courses include a
youth and community option and there are courses for graduates who wish to
become youth workers. In Scotland one-, two- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are
provided by the University of Ulster. All school teachers who qualify before the
end of 1988 are recognised as qualified youth workers.
Full-time youth workers are supported by some 500,000 part-time workers,
many of them unpaid, both qualified and unqualified. Short courses and
conferences on youth and community work are held. There are also in-service
courses for serving youth workers and officers. Both initial and in-service
courses are validated by the Council for Education and Training in Youth and
Community Work. »
A substantial sum of money is awarded by the many grant-giving foundations
and trusts each year for activities involving young people. The Royal Jubilee
Trusts, formed in 1978 from King George’s Jubilee Trust (started in 1935 at the
time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V) and The Queen’s Silver Jubilee
Trust, which arose from the 1977 Queen's Silver Jubilee Appeal, support work
involving young people aged 8 to 25 (King George’s Jubilee Trust) and young
people up to the age of 25 involved in voluntary community service work (The
Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust). King George’s Jubilee Trust has distributed
nearly £6 million since 1935 and The Queen's Silver Jubilee Trust over £10
million since 1978. In addition. The Prince’s Trust, which was set up in 1976 to
help disadvantaged young people aged 14 to 25, has disbursed some £2 million
to individuals and small ad hoc groups.
The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, which operates through bodies such
as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, enables
young people from Britain and other Commonwealth countries to take part,
with the voluntary assistance of adults, in a variety of challenging activities in
four areas: community service, expeditions, the development of personal
interests and social and practical skills, and physical recreation.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service designed
to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled, and many others
work on environmental projects. Organisations providing opportunities for
community service, such as Community Service Volunteers, International
Voluntary Service and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, receive
grants from the Government. Many schools also organise community service
activities as part of the curriculum and voluntary work in the community is
sponsored by a number of churches.
8 The
Environment
Development
Plans
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has had
considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry, com¬
merce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing environ¬
mental pollution. The underlying approach is to promote efficiency, economy
and amenity in the use and development of land, respecting both the needs of
development and the interests of conservation. There is no ‘national plan’ for
urban and land development, but there is a statutory system of land-use
planning applying to virtually every kind of development, and there are laws
dealing specifically with environmental health and the control of pollution. In
general, all development requires local ‘planning permission’, and applications
for permission are dealt with in the light of development plans which set out
strategies for each area on such matters as housing, transport, industry and
open land. However, many minor developments are subject to a general
permission under which they do not need a specific planning application; the
opportunity is being taken to expand this general permission wherever possible.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations take an active interest in planning,
conservation and the control of pollution.
Planning
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and
Scotland and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England for land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Development
Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Large-scale planning in
England and Wales excluding London is primarily the responsibility of the
county councils and the metropolitan district councils, while district councils
and, in London, the councils of the London boroughs and the City of London are
responsible for most local plans and development control, the main housing
functions and many environmental health matters. In Scotland planning
functions are undertaken by regional and district councils whose responsibili¬
ties are divided on a basis broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the
more rural regions and the islands, all planning responsibilities are carried out
by the regional and islands councils respectively. In Northern Ireland the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland is responsible for planning
matters through six divisional planning offices which work closely with the
district councils. The councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
General problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number
of government departments, but each development proposal normally requires
the local planning authority's consent.
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’ and
local plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities and
182
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Public
Participation
require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the development
and other use of land including measures for the improvement of the physical
environment and traffic management. Local plans provide detailed guidance,
either generally for development expected to start within about ten years, or,
more specifically, in ‘action area' plans, where implementation is to be given
short-term priority, and in ‘subject’ plans which concentrate on special issues
such as mineral working. The plans are normally prepared by district planning
authorities, although sometimes by county planning authorities, and must
conform generally to the approved structure plan. In exceptional cases, with
ministerial approval, the adoption of a local plan may precede the approval of a
structure plan. Local plans are adopted by the planning authorities without
being subject to ministerial approval unless called in by the Secretary of State.
All plans are kept under review and may be altered from time to time. In Greater
London and the other six metropolitan areas in England structure and local
plans will in future be gradually replaced by new unitary development plans.
This follows abolition of the county planning authorities in those areas on
1 April 1986. Unitary development plans will be prepared and normally adopted
by London borough and metropolitan district planning authorities. They will
contain both general policies and detailed proposals for land use and develop¬
ment control. Like local plans, unitary development plans can be called in by the
Secretary of State in exceptional circumstances.
Scotland has a broadly similar system which can also include the production
of a regional report by regional and islands authorities, outlining their priorities
and policies. Under Northern Ireland's single-tier system, plans are prepared by
the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity to
express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative stages of
the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must ensure
adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans; representa¬
tions may be made about them to the authorities. These opportunities for public
participation are additional to provisions for objecting to prepared plans. In the
case of structure plans the Secretary of State normally holds an examination in
public of matters on which he or she requires more information in order to reach
a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be heard at a public
local inquiry held by the planning authorities. There will be similar provisions
for participation in the preparation of unitary development plans and for
making objections to them. Usually the planning authorities will hold a public
local inquiry to hear objectors to unitary development plans. The Secretary of
State has the option, however, of holding an examination in public into the
general policies only of unitary development plans.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority, and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. (In Scotland there is a system of
neighbour notification of planning applications, under which the applicant
must notify the proprietors of land and buildings adjoining the site of a
proposed development at the same time as the application is submitted to the
local planning authority.) The applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of
State if planning permission is refused or is granted subject to conditions. Most
appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors (in Scotland reporters)
appointed by the Secretary of State.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of representations at public inquiries. For
THE ENVIRONMENT

planning applications which do not give rise to public inquiries there is a right
of appeal to an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
them for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance, for example, proposals for a
major new airport or coalfield. The applicant and the local planning authority
have the right to be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a
public inquiry is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development
schemes of exceptional importance the departments concerned have set up
procedures to aid the progress of the inquiry by helping the parties to resolve
peripheral matters beforehand. Where highway development is proposed, the
government minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he or she considers
appropriate; these generally relate to the compulsory acquisition of land.
The 32 new towns designated since 1946 (see map, p 184) represent one of the
most significant achievements in recent British planning. Twenty-one of them
are in England, two in Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. Most
of them had an existing town or village as a nucleus. The new towns programme
has taken account of a number of policy objectives, notably the dispersal of
industry and population from congested cities to the surrounding regions, and
the stimulation of the regional economy in areas suffering from the decline of old
industries or in need of industrial diversification. The new town development
corporations' priorities now are to maximise private investment in housing and
employment and to achieve a balanced community able to generate its own
growth. The new towns have a total population of over 2 million and by the time
their growth is complete are expected to house 2-5 million people. Several have
become regional centres for shopping and office accommodation.
In England the new towns programme is nearing completion, with fourteen
having been substantially completed and their development corporations (which
supervised the planning and development of the towns) dissolved. Target
dissolution dates for the seven remaining development corporations have now
been set in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When a development corporation is
wound up. its remaining assets are transferred to the Commission for the New
Towns, which manages the assets and arranges for their disposal, mainly to the
private sector. The New Towns and Urban Development Corporations Act 1985
provides for the eventual dissolution of the Commission. The dissolution of the
five Scottish development corporations will not begin before the 1990s. In Wales
responsibility for Newtown rests with the Development Board for Rural Wales
(known as ‘Mid-Wales Development ) while the corporation responsible for
Cwmbran is to be dissolved in 1988. In Northern Ireland development of the new
towns has been incorporated in a new District Towns Strategy which is the
responsibility of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities is one of the most
important tasks in modern planning. Past policies have produced many
successes including the replacement of most of the slums and the improvement
of much old housing, but other problems remain. They include high unemploy¬
ment, decay and dereliction, and population structures with relatively large
proportions of the disadvantaged and the elderly. It is the Government’s policy to
work out, in co-operation with local authorities, a package of measures for the
most badly affected areas that is most likely to improve conditions and
encourage, as far as possible, local voluntary action, notably by means of
partnerships (see p 185), and the co-operation of the private sector in
regenerating local economies. Various special measures, aimed at increasing

Urban
Programme
employment opportunities and the involvement of residents in the rejuvenation
of their areas, have been introduced.
The inner city areas have been given greater resources and priority by central
government for a number of years. The ‘Urban Programme’ has been increased
from a 1977-78 level in England and Wales of under £30 million to £317 million
in 1986-87. The programme complements the main social, environmental and
economic programmes of local authorities, often by providing extra facilities
which would otherwise not be available, such as day nurseries, centres for the
elderly and language classes for ethnic minorities, and covers industrial,
commercial, environmental and recreational provision as well. The Urban
Programme in its present form is to be simplified from 1987-88 as part of a
gradual attempt to improve its effectiveness. Proposals were announced in the
autumn of 1986 with a view to further concentrating resources on areas with
special problems and needs, and to achieving a more tangible impact with
available funds. The Urban Programme represents only a part of the central
assistance to urban, and other, local authorities. The main contributions
are through the annual rate support grant, housing subsidy and other
programmes.
In certain places, special schemes are in operation. A co-ordinated ‘part¬
nership’ approach is in operation in seven English areas (Birmingham,
Liverpool, Manchester/Salford, Newcastle upon Tyne/Gateshead and the inner
London boroughs of Hackney, Islington and Lambeth) in which central and local
government work together to tackle urban problems where they are at their most
severe. Each partnership has a three-year action programme rolled forward
annually, which is based on the needs of the area and its particular priorities.
Partnerships receive allocations of urban programme resources ranging from
£10 million to £25 million a year. In 1985 the Government announced the
establishment of five ‘city action teams’ (one for the inner London boroughs and
one for each of the other partnership areas) to secure improved co-operation
between government departments in developing and implementing their
policies and programmes for these areas.
In February 1986 a new initiative was announced, involving the creation of
task forces’ to intensify and bring together the efforts of government depart¬
ments, local government, the private sector and the local community in eight
inner city areas: two in London, and one in Leeds, Middlesbrough, Leicester,
Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham. Funds in addition to those available
under existing programmes would be provided and the initiative would be
co-ordinated by the Secretary of State for Employment.
To meet the particular problems and opportunities of the London docklands
and the Merseyside dock area following large-scale dock closures, the Govern¬
ment has set up urban development corporations modelled on the new town
development corporations, and these are receiving some £67 million in
1986-87. Elsewhere in England 23 ‘programme authorities’ have been identi¬
fied where the problems are on a slightly smaller scale but still merit special
attention. These authorities prepare their own Inner Area Programmes and, like
the partnerships, receive special allocations of Urban Programme resources. In
August 1986 proposals were announced to create a further 22 programme
authorities. They are being invited to submit co-ordinated Inner Area Pro¬
grammes for the first time in 1987-88.
Urban Development Grant aims to promote the economic and physical
regeneration of deprived urban areas by encouraging private sector investment.
Grant is available for capital investment projects which would not otherwise go
ahead and would contribute to meeting the special social needs of inner urban
areas. Since the scheme was launched in 1982, some 191 projects have been
186

approved, representing a total capital investment of over £480 million. Under
the Housing and Planning Bill the Government will be able to pay Urban
Regeneration Grants to promote the regeneration of specific run-down urban
areas by private enterprise.
National garden festivals, based on the European idea of garden shows, are
being introduced with the aim of rejuvenating inner urban areas and reclaiming
derelict sites. The first festival in Liverpool in 1984, which had international
status and attracted nearly 3-4 million visitors, was followed by a second in
Stoke-on-Trent in 1986, and further festivals will be held in Glasgow in 1988,
Gateshead in 1990 and in Wales in 1992.
In Scotland, where the Urban Programme amounts to £35 million in 1986—87,
a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the city s east end (the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal Project) has been organised on somewhat similar
lines to the partnership areas in England, and a further eight Scottish districts
have been designated under the Inner Urban Areas Act. In addition, the Scottish
Development Agency operates the Local Enterprise Grants for Urban Projects
Scheme (equivalent to the Urban Development Grant). In Northern Ireland,
inner city problems on a substantial scale are largely confined to Belfast, where
a major housing programme is supplemented by Urban Development Grants,
an environmental improvement scheme and a comprehensive development
programme to regenerate the commercial parts of the inner city. In 1986—87
these programmes have a combined allocation of £8 million.
In Wales, where the Urban Programme is administered by the Welsh Office, the
Secretary of State for Wales has launched a new community-based initiative for
the south Wales valleys aimed at bringing about a substantial improvement in
the environments of the town centres and surrounding areas. Ideas on how the
valley communities can be revitalised and improved have been sought from
within the communities. The Welsh Office will use existing mechanisms of
assistance and make additional resources available to bring about change.
Since 1981 the Government has set up 25 ‘enterprise zones' (see map, opposite).
The aim of this experimental policy is to see how far industrial and commercial
activity can be stimulated by the removal of certain tax burdens and by relaxing
or speeding up the application of a number of administrative controls. The
zones, which vary widely but all contain land suitable for development, range in
size from about 50 to 450 hectares (about 120 to over 1,100 acres). Benefits in
the zones include exemption from rates (the local property tax); 100 per cent
allowances for corporation and income tax purposes for capital expenditure on
industrial and commercial buildings; a much simplified planning system in
which most forms of development are automatically permitted; and a reduction
in government requests for statistical information.
The Housing and Planning Bill, introduced in early 1986, would provide for the
establishment of ‘simplified planning zones’, which would be somewhat akin to
enterprise zones and where a reduction in bureaucratic control through a
mixture of deregulation and incentives would encourage businesses, especially
small firms, to locate there.
Housing
The pattern of housing tenure has changed considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and a decline in privately rented
accommodation. Between the end of 1971 and 1985 the proportion of
owner-occupied dwellings in Great Britain rose trom 51 to 62 per cent of the
housing stock, while the proportion accounted for by dwellings rented from a
local authority or new town authority fell from 31 to 27 per cent, and the

proportion of other types of tenure fell from 19 to 11 per cent. The fall in the last
category reflected the decline in privately rented dwellings, while the number of
housing association dwellings increased substantially during this period. There
are variations, however, in the distribution of tenure between different parts of
the country; in Scotland almost half of the dwellings are rented from public
authorities while in Wales about two-thirds of dwellings are owner-occupied.
The encouragement of a further extension of home ownership is a major aim of
the Government's housing policy, while the emphasis of public sector housing
policy has shifted from new building to modernisation, improvement and
making better use of existing dwellings.
There are some 22 million dwellings, houses being much more common than
flats (the ratio is roughly four to one), and around 50 per cent of families live in a
post-1945 home. Throughout this century pressure on housing accommodation
has been increased more by the rapid rise in the numbei* of separate households
than by the increase in population. While the number of people has increased by
about two-fifths, the number of households has more than doubled. The 1981
Census showed the total number of households in Great Britain as 19-5 million.
Improvements in living standards were continuing: only 1 -3 per cent were not in
self-contained accommodation, 4-3 per cent lived at an average density of more
than one person per room and 3 -2 per cent were lacking or sharing use of a bath.
New house construction is undertaken by both public and private sectors but
over the past few years the private sector has built many more dwellings than the
public sector. In addition, over 6 per cent of the new building in 1985 was
carried out by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authorities
provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly for sale
to owner-occupiers.
As with environmental planning, responsibility for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme is borne by the Secretary of State for
the Environment in England and by the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Although the policies are broadly similar throughout
Britain, provisions may differ slightly in Northern Ireland and Scotland from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration of housing is subject to building
regulations laid down by the Government. Building in the private sector is
regulated by an independent organisation, the National House-Building Coun¬
cil, which sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the Council’s insurance scheme
which provides ten-year guarantees against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will only make
a loan for purchase of a new house if it is covered by the Council’s certificate.
Local authorities are responsible for the payment of house renovation grants
and the implementation of housing renewal programmes. Many have housing
advisory centres to provide information on aspects of housing.
The number of people owning their own homes has more than trebled in the last
35 years, and the number of owner-occupied dwellings amounted to over 12
million in 1985, compared with 4 million in 1951. Most public sector tenants
have the right to buy the homes they occupy at discounts which vary according
to the length of their occupancy. Local authorities have been asked to encourage
low-cost home ownership by selling land to builders to construct homes for
‘first-time’ buyers, or to individuals or groups to build their own ‘first-time’
homes in partnership with private builders; by improving homes for sale; by
selling dilapidated homes for improvement by the purchaser (‘homesteading’);
by offering shared ownership (part owning, part renting); and by using local
authority guarantee powers to facilitate lending by building societies.
THE ENVIRONMENT
189
Mortgage Loans
Public Sector
Housing
In Northern Ireland the concept ol shared ownership has been developed in
the public sector by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and in the private
sector by the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association. The Execu¬
tive has offered most of its homes for sale to the tenants and over 30,000 have
been sold.
Most people buy their homes with a mortgage loan (for which the properties are
regarded as securities) from such sources as building societies, banks,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Some companies also make loans for house purchase to their own employees.
Building societies are by far the largest sources of such loans, their share of
the market being about 79 per cent in 1985. For first-time buyers they usually
advance about 90 per cent of their valuation of a property with the help of an
appropriate insurance guarantee but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent.
Loans are normally repayable over periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years
in certain circumstances) by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and
interest. Ordinary mortgage loans from building societies are usually available
to purchasers on average income or above. People with insufficient income to
obtain a mortgage for outright purchase may be able to participate in a scheme
in which a housing association buys the home and sells a share in it to them,
allowing them to rent the remainder and to purchase it later if they wish.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on interest payments arising on up
to £30,000 of their mortgage loans (on their main home only). Under the
Homeloan Scheme first-time home buyers who have saved for two years and are
buying a home in the lower price range may qualify for an extra loan of £600
interest-free for up to five years, and a tax-free bonus of up to £110.
Most of the public housing in Great Britain is provided by 460 local housing
authorities. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London), the
district councils; in London, the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London; and in Scotland, the district and islands councils.
Other public housing authorities are the new town authorities, the Scottish
Special Housing Association, which supplements building by local authorities
in Scotland, and the Development Board for Rural Wales. The Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is responsible for the provision and management of public
housing in Northern Ireland.
Subsidies may be made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout. Public housing
authorities own about 6 million houses and flats. The number of homes owned
by each authority varies widely, from 148 homes in the Isles of Scilly to 129,000
in Birmingham. Most authorities own between 2,500 and 15,000 dwellings.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction and of
modernisation of their existing stock by raising loans on the open market, by
borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board (an independent statutory body
set up to make loans to local authorities) or from the capital receipts generated
by the sale of local authority houses and housing land. Current expenditure,
including maintenance and management costs and loan interest and repay¬
ment, is met from rents, which may be supplemented by subsidies from the
Government and, where required to balance housing revenue accounts, from
the rates. Local authorities are required to charge their tenants reasonable rents
(which keep a balance between the interests of tenants and ratepayers).
Sheltered housing (usually accommodation with an alarm system and
resident warden) is provided for those elderly people who need this degree of
support, but increasing emphasis is being placed on schemes to help elderly
people to continue to live in their own homes and on schemes to adapt existing

housing to meet the housing needs of physically handicapped people. Local
authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that accommodation (not necessarily
owned by the authority) is available for homeless people who have dependent
children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
The Housing Act 1980 established a charter for public sector tenants in
England and Wales, giving them statutory rights which include security of
tenure, provision for a resident member of the tenant’s family to succeed to the
tenancy on the death of the tenant, rights of subletting and taking in lodgers,
and, at the landlord's discretion, reimbursement for improvements made by the
tenant. With a few exceptions, public sector tenants of at least two years'
standing can buy their house or flat at a discount which depends on the length
of occupation. Similar provisions are made for Scotland and Northern Ireland
under separate legislation. By the end of 1985 some 631,000 tenants in Great
Britain had bought their homes under these provisions. The Housing and
Building Control Act 1984 further extended the rights of public sector tenants
by giving them the right to repair and the right to exchange their homes.
A National Mobility Scheme, sponsored by the Department of the Environ¬
ment, the Scottish Development Department, the Welsh Office and the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, has been introduced to
assist tenants who need to move to another area for employment or social
reasons. Tenants who wish to move by exchanging homes are able to make use
of a computer-based national information scheme.
There has been a steady decline in the number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords (including tied accommodation), from over 50 per cent of the
housing stock in 1951 to less than 10 per cent in 1984 (about 2 million
dwellings). Major factors have been the increased demand for owner-occupation,
the greater availability of public rented housing and the operation of rent
restriction. Privately rented dwellings are predominantly found in older hous¬
ing. Many landlords are individuals owning a small amount of property, but
some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including property
companies.
Most private lettings are subject to the system of protection provided by the
Rent Act 1977 (and similar legislation in Scotland) and associated legislation.
Where the letting is a fully protected ‘regulated tenancy’, the tenant or the
landlord may apply for a ‘fair rent' to be fixed by independent rent officers and
there is a wide degree of security of tenure. More limited provisions apply where
there is a resident landlord, when a ‘reasonable rent’ may be fixed by a rent
tribunal (in Scotland by a rent assessment committee). The Housing Act 1980
(and similar legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland) introduced an
additional system of‘shorthold’ lettings, giving tenants security of tenure for an
agreed period of between one and five years, after which the landlord is
guaranteed repossession. In London and in Scotland a fair rent must be
registered for a shorthold; elsewhere it is optional. The 1980 Act also introduced
for England and Wales the system of‘assured’ tenancies, which allows approved
bodies to let newly built property at freely negotiated rents outside the Rent Acts.
Tenants and most other residential occupiers may not be evicted without a court
order. Harassment of residential occupiers is a criminal offence. Occupiers may,
depending on their personal circumstances, be eligible for housing benefit to
assist them in paying their rent and rates.
In Northern Ireland only pre-1956 properties subject to rent restriction come
under statutory control, and rent levels are linked to those of the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive. Rent increases are permitted only for properties
which meet a prescribed standard. There is an uncontrolled rent sector,
comprising mostly furnished accommodation.

Housing
Associations
Improving
Older Houses
Housing associations extend the choice of housing by providing accommodation
available for rent or sale through new building or the rehabilitation of older
property. The associations normally cater for people who would otherwise look to
a local authority for a home, and also provide particularly for the special needs of
elderly, disabled and single people.
The associations, which are non-profit-making, have grown under govern¬
ment encouragement and now own some 500,000 homes. Individual associa¬
tions range in size from a group of‘almshouses’ for fewer than ten old people to
associations with more than 10,000 homes. In Great Britain housing schemes
carried out by associations qualify for government grant if the association is one
of over 2,600 registered with the Housing Corporation, a statutory body. Rented
homes owned by housing associations come within the fair rent arrangements,
and most housing association tenants have rights under the tenants’ charter in
the Housing Act 1985—in Scotland the Tenants’ Rights, Etc (Scotland) Act
1980—including, in some cases, the right to buy or the possibility of a discount
on the purchase of an alternative home. Housing associations also provide
accommodation on a shared ownership basis, allowing the occupier to part-rent
and part-own a home, and they can purchase improved older properties for
outright sale. Both activities are eligible for government grants.
In Northern Ireland assistance is available to associations registered with the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. Rent levels are linked to
those of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Tenants have rights under a
tenants charter, but not the right to buy, although housing associations may
sell their dwellings voluntarily.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment used to be major
features of housing policy. Large-scale clearance is now virtually at an end,
although there are still pockets of unfit housing for which demolition is
considered the best solution. Greater emphasis has been placed on the retention
of existing communities accompanied by the modernisation and conversion of
sub-standard homes. Although housing conditions have improved considerably,
problems remain in some areas where there are high concentrations of dwellings
lacking basic amenities or requiring substantial repairs.
More recently there has been concern about the problems associated with
high-density local authority estates in inner city areas, some of which have not
been popular with tenants, and about serious structural defects found in some
local authority dwellings. Authorities are tackling these problems in a variety of
ways including refurbishment and sale to the private sector.
The Government’s Urban Housing Renewal Unit, set up in 1985, is working
with local authorities to deal with the problems of their run-down council
estates. Measures which are being developed include local housing management
along the lines of the Department of the Environment's Priority Estates Project
(see below); the injection of private sector skills and resources; capital
investment in the refurbishment of the housing stock; community refurbish¬
ment schemes to enable previously unemployed people to work on environmen¬
tal improvements; and the development of tenant management and ownership
co-operatives.
The Priority Estates Project was set up in 1979 to promote locally based
housing management, under which housing officers on the estates are
responsible for providing a co-ordinated range of services. Important elements
include local budgetary control of key management functions such as repairs,
lettings, rent collection, caretaking and grounds maintenance, and effective
consultation with tenants and their involvement in initiatives to improve the
estate. There are more than 80 estate management initiatives in 53 local
authorities involving about 80,000 dwellings. These authorities manage about a
192

third of the English council housing stock. In 1983 the Welsh Office set up
similar arrangements in Wales.
Over 800,000 home improvement grants were paid to householders in Great
Britain between 1980 and 1986. There are four types of grant: improvement
grants, for carrying out improvements to a good standard; intermediate grants,
for the provision of standard amenities (such as a bath and an inside lavatory)
and associated repairs; grants for substantial and structural repairs to pre-1919
houses (pre-1957 in Northern Ireland and pre-1964 in Scotland, where a grant
can cover all forms of repair work); and special grants for providing standard
amenities and repairs (not available in Scotland) and means of escape from fire
in houses which are in multiple occupation. In addition, since 1978 grants for
loft insulation have been paid in respect of some 2 million homes.
Declaring ‘general improvement areas' and ‘housing action areas' enables local
authorities in England and Wales to tackle the improvement of whole areas of
older housing systematically. General improvement areas (of which there are
more than 1,600) contain fundamentally sound houses and a stable population.
Housing action areas (of which there are about 260 in England and Wales) are
characterised by relatively poor housing and bad environmental conditions
combined with social stress. Local authorities have special powers to bring
about an improvement in living conditions for the benefit of residents. In both
types of area government financial aid for environmental improvement (such as
landscaping and work to improve the external appearance of buildings) is
available to local authorities. In these areas home improvement grants may
range up to 75 per cent of the eligible expense limit, and in certain cases of
hardship up to 90 per cent. ‘Enveloping’, introduced in 1982, involves the
renovation of the external fabric of whole terraces or streets of mainly privately
owned property in housing action areas which has deteriorated beyond routine
maintenance. It is carried out by local authorities at public expense, and the
encouragement it gives to residents is reflected in the increased take-up of
grants for improvements to the interiors after enveloping.
An ‘improvement-for-sale' scheme has also been introduced; the Government
helps to meet any loss a local authority may make in buying, improving and
selling run-down or neglected housing.
In Scotland housing action area powers are available for the improvement of
areas in which at least half the houses fail to meet a statutory tolerable standard.
Since 1975 some 1,400 housing action areas, covering houses requiring
improvement or demolition, have been declared by local authorities. Outside
such areas in Scotland local authorities have powers to require the improvement
of houses below the statutory tolerable standard, or lacking certain basic
amenities, by improvement orders. In housing action areas or where an
improvement order has been made, grants of 75 per cent (up to 90 per cent in
cases of hardship) of the eligible expense limit may be made. Government
financial aid is also given towards the costs incurred by local authorities in
improving the environment of predominantly residential areas.
Northern Ireland has a major problem of derelict and unfit housing, especially
in Belfast, the situation having been made worse by civil disturbance. Concerted
measures are being taken in housing action areas, and there is a continuing
programme of rehabilitation in Belfast. Housing receives priority in Northern
Ireland’s social and environmental programme.
Conservation
Britain is one of the leading countries in the conservation movement. A wide
range of groups, including many voluntary organisations, are active in it. The
Council for Environmental Conservation is a national coalition of non¬
governmental organisations which focuses attention on major issues.

Lists of buildings of special architectural or historical interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; some 380,000 buildings are
listed in England, over 33,000 in Scotland and 10,600 in Wales. It is against the
law to demolish, extend or alter the character of any listed building without
special consent from the local planning authority or the appropriate Secretary of
State; where consent is given to demolish a building, the Royal Commission on
Historical Monuments (for England) and similar bodies for Scotland and Wales
have an opportunity to make a photographic and written record of the building.
Emergency building preservation notices’ can be served by the local planning
authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
Maintaining royal parks (which are open to the public) and palaces is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and
Wales. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (known
as English Heritage) is charged with protecting and conserving England's
architectural and archaeological heritage; it manages some 400 ancient
monuments on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment and gives
grants for the repair of ancient monuments, historic buildings and buildings in
conservation areas in England. In Scotland and Wales similar functions are
performed by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Directorate of the Scottish
Development Department and by Cadw (Welsh Historic Monuments) with advice
from an ancient monuments board and a historic buildings council for each
country. Local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of
architectural or historic interest. The National Heritage Memorial Fund provides
assistance towards the cost of acquiring, maintaining or preserving land,
buildings, works of art and other items of outstanding interest which are also of
importance to the national heritage. In 1985—86 the Fund gave assistance, for
example, towards the National Trust's acquisition of a stretch of important
coastline on the Menai Straits, north Wales. The Government gave the Fund an
additional £25 million in 1985 to enable it to secure the preservation of
Kedleston Hall (Derbyshire), Nostell Priory (West Yorkshire) and Weston Park
(Shropshire), and a further £10-5 million in 1986 in order to top up its reserves.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection over 5,000
‘conservation areas' of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works which make a significant contribution towards the
preservation or enhancement of such an area.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland
has 160 historic monuments in its care, and some 640 monuments are
scheduled for protection. The Department is also responsible for listing
buildings of special architectural or historic interest and for the designation of
conservation areas; there are some 7,000 listed buildings and 50 conservation
areas. It may also provide grants and loans to help with the repair and
maintenance of listed buildings and to preserve or enhance conservation areas.
It has the advice ol a Historic Buildings Council and a Historic Monuments
Council.
Among the voluntary organisations which campaign for the preservation of
buildings are the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient
Monuments Society; the Georgian Group; the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland, the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society;
and the Council for British Archaeology. The National Trust (for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty), an independent charity with more than
1 -3 million members, owns and protects some 200 historic buildings in addition
to 246,900 hectares (more than 610,000 acres) of land and 750 km (466 miles)
of coastline in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Scotland has its own
National Trust.

Besides helping to conserve the finest buildings inherited from the past, the
Government encourages high standards in new building. The Secretary of State
for the Environment, in collaboration with the independent Royal Institute of
British Architects (RIBA) and the National House-Building Council, makes
awards for good design in housing, with categories for renovation as well as new
building. Scotland and Wales have similar but separate awards schemes. The
Government has also encouraged the use of architectural competitions, and has
set an example in the award of some of its own contracts. Royal Fine Art
Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland advise government
departments, planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of
public amenity or artistic importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional body for architects, exercises control over
standards in architectural education and encourages the maintenance of high
architectural standards in the profession. The Royal Incorporation of Architects
in Scotland is allied to it, as is the Royal Society of Ulster Architects. The Civic
Trust, with associate trusts in Scotland, Wales and north-east and north-west
England, encourages high standards in urban design and the protection and
improvement of the environment.
The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands in the
interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting of trees.
Landowners generally must replace trees which die or are removed or destroyed
in contravention of a preservation order.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
neighbouring towns merging into one another, or to preserve the special
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from further
building development and where people can seek recreation) have been
established on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London’s green belt,
for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which is used for
recreation. Some 1 ’9 million hectares (4-7 million acres) of land have been
designated as green belt in Great Britain.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use at
the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline against erosion is administered
centrally by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office and
the Scottish Office.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken by
the Countryside Commission (see p 195) in 1966—70, recommended that
certain stretches of undeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Jointly with local authorities, the Commission has
defined 37 of these coasts so far, protecting nearly 1,200 km (750 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to raise
funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural beauty and
recreational value. More than £7 million has been raised so far and as a result
the Trust has under its protection 724 km (450 miles) of coastline in England
and Wales. Under a campaign launched in 1985 the Trust is raising funds to
acquire a similar length considered at risk. Some 128 km (80 miles) of coast in
Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with the National Trust for
THE ENVIRONMENT

Scotland. In Northern Ireland 66 km (41 miles) of coast and coastal path have
been acquired by the National Trust.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; development
associated with North Sea oil and gas is occurring on remote and unspoiled
coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but planning guidelines drawn up by the
Scottish Development Department aim to ensure that oil-related activities are
sited so as to make the best use of existing labour and infrastructure and to
minimise the effect on the coastline. Provision has also been made for funds to
be set aside for the restoration of sites once there is no further need for them.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for encouraging and promoting measures to conserve
and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and for
encouraging the development of facilities for open-air recreation in the
countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (sometimes in
association with other bodies) and private individuals of country parks and
picnic sites often within easy reach of towns; the provision or improvement of
recreational paths; the encouragement of amenity tree-planting schemes; and
the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for bathing, sailing
and other activities. Some 200 country parks and 240 picnic sites have been
recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Commission. In Scotland
33 country parks are recognised and a large number of local authority and
private sector schemes for the provision of a variety of countryside facilities have
been approved for grant aid. The Commissions undertake research projects and
experimental schemes, working in consultation with local authorities and such
bodies as the Nature Conservancy Council (see p 196) and the Sports Councils.
The Commissions give financial assistance to public, private and voluntary
bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and amenity
projects, and landscape conservation projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
areas of outstanding natural beauty ; to define heritage coasts in conjunction
with local authorities (see p 194); and to make proposals -for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished, covering 13,600 sq km (5,250 sq miles), or 9 per cent of the area of
England and Wales. Some 36 areas of outstanding natural beauty have been
designated and confirmed, covering 17,000 sq km (6,600 sq miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures, for
which grants are available, such as tree planting and the removal of eyesores. In
the national parks other measures for the benefit of the public include the
provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas, and information centres. All
national parks and some other designated areas have warden services. Most
local authority expenditure on national parks is met by government grants.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment on the preservation of amenities and the designation
of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural
beauty have been designated, covering 259,500 hectares (641,000 acres), and
seven areas are being managed as country parks and one as a regional park.
In Scotland there are no national parks as such, but there are 40 ’national
scenic areas', covering more than 1 million hectares (2-5 million acres), or 13 per
cent of the country, where certain kinds of development are subject to

consultation with the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and in the event of
a disagreement, with the Secretary of State for Scotland. More than 98 per cent
of the land in Scotland is designated countryside within which the Commission
may provide grants for a wide range of countryside projects.
There are seven forest parks in Great Britain, covering some 243,000 hectares
(600,000 acres) and administered by the Forestry Commission, and nine in
Northern Ireland administered by the Forest Service of the Department of
Agriculture. Camping and other recreational facilities are provided.
Many voluntary organisations are concerned to preserve the amenities of the
countryside; they include the Councils for the Protection of Rural England and
of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland and the
Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare and keep under
review definitive maps showing public rights of way; they are also responsible for
keeping rights of way free from obstruction, and signposted. If a path is not
shown on the map, a private citizen may claim that it is a public right of way if it
has been regarded as such a.nd used without hindrance for at least 20 years.
Public footpaths are maintained by local authorities, which also supervise
landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths, close existing paths no longer needed for public use and divert
paths to meet the needs of either the public or landowners. Local planning
authorities can also convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve
the amenities of their area. There are 14 approved long-distance footpaths and
bridleways in England and Wales covering some 2,700 km (1,685 miles) and
three approved long-distance routes in Scotland covering some 580 km
(360 miles). Voluntary organisations concerned with footpaths include the
Open Spaces Society, the Scottish Rights of Way Society and the Ramblers
Association.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, although many
landowners permit more or less free access. Local planning authorities can
secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements cannot be
obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public access. Similar
powers cover Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1 -5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually privately
owned, but people other than the owner may have various rights on or over it, for
example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by law and cannot
be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries of State for the
Environment or Wales.
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council, which has the functions of establishing, main¬
taining and managing nature reserves, advising the Government, providing
general information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research.
There are 214 national nature reserves covering some 155,420 hectares
(384,040 acres). Some 5,000 sites of special scientific interest have been notified
for their flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features.
The Forestry Commission has 340 sites of special scientific interest on its land
(covering 70,000 hectares [173,000 acres]) on which nature conservation is a
primary objective of management. Local authorities have declared about 130
local nature reserves. Voluntary nature conservation trusts and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds play an important part in protecting wildlife,
having established between them some 1,770 reserves. The trusts are affiliated
THE ENVIRONMENT

to a parent organisation, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation. The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, with over 413,000 members and 80,000
young ornithologists, is the largest voluntary wildlife conservation body in
Europe.
In Northern Ireland the Committee for Nature Conservation advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland on nature conservation
matters including the establishment and management of terrestrial and marine
nature reserves and the declaration of areas of special scientific interest.
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 extended the list of protected species,
restricted the introduction into the countryside of animals or plants not
normally found in the wild and afforded greater protection for areas of special
scientific interest and other important habitats. In Northern Ireland two orders,
which became operative in 1985, have brought legislation into line with the rest
of Britain on species and habitat protection.
Other conservation measures promoted by the Government have included a
ban (in conjunction with other European Community countries) on the import
of whale products and certain seal pup products, a system of licensing zoos to
ensure that captive animals are kept in suitable conditions, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds. It is proposed to designate certain areas, of
importance for their landscape, historic and habitat value, ‘environmentally
sensitive areas as a result of a change in European Community regulations
allowing governments to make special payments to farmers to continue their
traditional farming methods for the sake of preserving the countryside and its
wildlife.
Derelict land is often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth-century
industrial development, but the restructuring of particular industries over the
past decade or so is continuing to add significantly to this problem in certain
areas. Dereliction can take various forms and can include mineral waste tips, old
mineral workings, former industrial sites such as steelworks, disused railways
and docks, and contaminated sites.
In England, central government grants are available under the Derelict Land
Act 1982 to local authorities and to other public bodies, to the private sector and
to nationalised industries for the reclamation of derelict land in order to bring it
into beneficial use or to improve its appearance. The expenditure provision for
the derelict land reclamation programme in 1986-87 is £78-4 million. The main
priority is given to reclamation schemes in urban, particularly inner city, areas
that lead to development by the private sector for industry, commerce and
especially housing. Between 1 April 1979 and 31 March 1985 some 8,377
hectares (20,700 acres) of derelict land were reclaimed in England with the aid of
some £400 million of derelict land grant.
In Scotland and Wales responsibility for derelict land reclamation rests with
the respective development agencies, which may acquire and reclaim land,
employ local authorities as their agents (in Scotland) or make grants to local
authorities for the purpose (in Wales). In Northern Ireland grants may be paid to
landowners who restore or improve derelict sites.
To prevent new dereliction, planning controls require that when permission is
given for mineral working various measures must be taken to minimise the
disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restoration is
practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of land for
disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting the height
of waste tips or requiring treatment of waste on completion of workings.
In Wales, land use is additionally encouraged by the Land Authority for Wales,
a statutory body with powers to make land available for development in
circumstances where the private sector would find this difficult or impossible.

Land Registers
Environmental

Administration
In England the Government has instituted, and made available for inspection,
registers of under-used land held by local authorities, nationalised industries
and other public bodies; some 60,000 hectares (148,000 acres) have been
registered. Of this, some 15,000 hectares (38,000 acres) have been deregistered
mainly because the land has been sold to the private sector or brought into use.
There is power to direct a public body to dispose of registered land; some 25 such
directions had been issued by January 1986. Registers are also published for
certain areas of Wales.
In July 1986 the Government launched a special initiative to encourage a wide
range of local environmental improvement work to be undertaken both by
volunteers and by the Manpower Services Commission Community Programme
teams. The initiative, which is being co-ordinated by a new organisation called
UK 2000 bringing together representatives of the participating organisations
and a number of independent members, aims to improve the natural and built
environment and people's enjoyment of it, and will also create new jobs and
provide work and training for the participants. Voluntary organisations will
promote programmes of work and will assist in the setting up of local projects
such as creating parks, footpaths and other areas of greenery in cities,
conserving the industrial heritage and the natural environment, tackling litter
problems and providing tourist information and facilities.
Control of Pollution
Government measures to control environmental pollution are long established,
and are complementary to the planning system and the various measures to
conserve amenities and the country's heritage.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to England, Scotland and
Wales, sets out a wide range of powers and duties for local and water authorities,
including control over wastes, air and water pollution and noise, and contains
important provisions on the release of information to the public on environmen¬
tal conditions. In particular, it introduced a new system for the comprehensive
planning of waste disposal operations so as to ensure that disposal is carried out
to satisfactory standards and that where practicable waste materials are
recovered and recycled. The Act also increased the penalties for a large number
of pollution offences. The provisions relating to noise and air pollution are fully
in force, as are a substantial number of those relating to waste on land. Similar
legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
Executive responsibility for pollution control rests in general with local and
water authorities, although certain registered industrial processes are con¬
trolled by the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate (of the Health and Safety
Executive). Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and
disposal of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from domestic and certain
non-registered industrial premises; and noise abatement measures. Sewerage
and sewage treatment and disposal are the responsibilities of regional water
authorities in England and Wales, of local authorities in Scotland and of the
Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. The regional water
authorities in England, the Welsh Water Authority, the river purification boards
and islands councils in Scotland and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland are responsible for control of water pollution.
An independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and international matters concerning the
pollution of the environment, on the adequacy of research and on the future

possibilities of danger to the environment. It has so far produced 11 reports
covering a wide range of topics.
Central government is principally concerned with formulating policy, exercis¬
ing general budgetary control, promoting the necessary legislation, and advising
pollution control authorities on its implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility for co-ordinating the work of the
Government on environmental protection and in this is assisted by a Central
Directorate of Environmental Protection within the Department. In Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland the respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for pollution control co-ordination in their countries. They are assisted by the
Scottish Development Department, the Water and Environmental Protection
Division of the Welsh Office, and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland respectively. From 1 April 1987 the Industrial Air Pollution
Inspectorate, the Radiochemical Inspectorate and, in the Department of the
Environment and the Welsh Office, the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate (see
below), will be amalgamated in a single unified inspectorate for England and
Wales to be known as Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Pollution.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, careless disposal of pesticides and chemicals and the
deposition of materials from the atmosphere and from flood-water. The Control
of Pollution Act places a duty on waste disposal authorities to ensure that there
are adequate arrangements to dispose of controlled wastes. It requires them to
draw up and revise periodically a waste disposal plan and establishes a licensing
system for most waste disposal sites, treatment plants and storage facilities
receiving controlled wastes. In addition, it provides for a more intensive control
system for certain especially hazardous or difficult wastes. Hazardous waste
inspectorates have been set up in the Department of the Environment, the
Welsh Office and the Scottish Development Department to advise local author¬
ities on how to improve their control of waste management and to work towards
environmentally acceptable standards for dealing with hazardous wastes.
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any public place in the open air or to
dump rubbish except in designated places. To help to counteract the problem of
litter, also an aspect of the UK 2000 scheme (see p 198), financial support is
given to the Keep Britain Tidy Group, which provides a comprehensive litter
abatement programme in collaboration with local authorities.
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce imports and waste
disposal costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already makes
considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and textiles.
Local authorities collect about 200,000 tonnes of waste paper and about
100,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap annually. In an increasing number of areas
there are bottle banks and can banks where the public can deposit used glass
and metal containers respectively. Voluntary organisations also arrange collec¬
tions of waste material. Waste disposal authorities have powers under the
Control of Pollution Act to take full account of opportunities for waste
reclamation and have a duty when drawing up their waste disposal plans to
include information on disposal methods to be used, including reclamation.
There has been a steady and significant improvement in water quality: the level
of pollution in the tidal Thames, for example, has been reduced to a quarter of
the 1950s’ level and over 100 different kinds of fish have been identified there
since 1964. A major scheme has been launched to clean up the Mersey, the
largest British estuary still suffering from severe pollution. Discharges of

Clean Air
polluting matter into rivers and estuaries have been controlled for many years
and recently powers have been extended to provide full control over discharges
into underground and coastal waters. Information on all aspects of water
pollution is publicly available on registers maintained by the individual water
authorities. More than 95 per cent of the population is provided with main
drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works serve over four-fifths of
the population—a very high proportion by international standards.
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international
conventions drawn up under the auspices of the International Maritime
Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in London, and
implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The Merchant Shipping
(Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 1983 and the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1986 make it an offence for ships of any nationality to discharge oil
or oily mixtures into British territorial waters and for British registered ships to
make similar discharges anywhere into the sea, except in accordance with the
regulations.
To deal with spillages of oil or chemicals at sea, which may cause coastal
pollution or threaten wildlife, the Department of Transport has a Marine
Pollution Control Unit which can call also upon the resources of the Marine
Survey and Coastguard services. The main treatment method is to spray
dispersant from aircraft or surface vessels, and emergency cargo transfer
equipment is available to remove oil from a damaged tanker. Local authorities
have the primary role in dealing with oil and chemical pollution of beaches and
inshore waters, and receive government advice and support. In a major incident
the Marine Pollution Control Unit would co-ordinate and lead the onshore
response.
The development of the offshore oil industry has brought an increased risk of
oil pollution in the North Sea. Offshore operators must ensure that oil does not
escape into the sea and are required to have contingency plans for dealing with
oil spilled accidentally. Discharges containing oil are controlled under the
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971. Discharges of chemicals are controlled and
monitored by a non-statutory Chemical Notification Scheme, administered by
the Department of Energy in consultation with fisheries departments.
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (which superseded the
Dumping at Sea Act 1974) tightened the controls over dumping at sea, the most
significant change being the introduction of specific controls on marine
incineration. Under the Act a licence has to be obtained for the permanent
deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at sea
is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the annexes to the
Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the London
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and
Other Matter 1972.
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke control
areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes an
offence. About two-thirds of the premises in conurbations are now covered by
smoke control orders. Emissions from most industrial premises are also subject
to the control of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts and the Public Health
Acts. The emission of dark smoke from any trade or industrial premises or from
the chimney of any building is in general prohibited, and new furnaces must be
capable as far as practicable of smokeless operation. The height of the chimney
serving a new furnace must generally be approved by the local authority, and
THE ENVIRONMENT
201
Noise
approved grit and dust arrestment plant has to be installed. Regulations
prescribe specific limits to the quantities of grit and dust which may be emitted
from certain furnaces. Industrial premises that have the greatest potential for
giving rise to noxious or offensive emissions are, in England and Wales, under
the control of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
Executive. In Scotland this function is discharged by the Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate. The Inspectorates require the best practicable means to be used to
prevent emissions or render them harmless. Similar legislation and controls
apply in Northern Ireland.
Strict controls are in force on emissions from motor vehicles, and Britain has
played a constructive role in European Community discussions on tighter
limits. The maximum permitted lead content of petrol in Britain was reduced to
015 grammes per litre on 31 December 1985. The European Community has
adopted a directive which requires the introduction of unleaded petrol
throughout the Community by October 1989. The first unleaded petrol in
Britain went on sale at selected service stations in June 1986.
Considerable progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air
and a better environment, especially in the last 30 years or so. Total emissions of
smoke in the air have fallen by about 85 per cent since 1960. The domestic
smoke control programme has been particularly important in achieving this
result. London no longer has the dense smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in
central London winter sunshine has increased by about 50 per cent since 1958.
Similar improvement has been achieved in other cities including Glasgow and
Sheffield. National sulphur dioxide emissions have fallen by nearly 40 per cent
since 1970. The Government intends to achieve further reductions of 30 per
cent from the 1980 levels of emissions of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides by the end of the 1990s.
Britain has become increasingly involved in international air pollution issues
such as acid rain, and with the possible implications of growing concentrations
o carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While the causes of acid rain are becoming
more clearly understood, there are still uncertainties about the likely effective¬
ness of remedial strategies. To help resolve these uncertainties, Britain is
supporting a programme of research, substantially expanded in 1986, on air
pollutants, their effects and the technology for their control, and is also
participating in international research programmes and monitoring schemes.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974 (and similar legislation in Northern Ireland)
requires local authorities to inspect their areas for noise nuisance and gives
them the power to deal with it. It also enables them to designate ‘noise
abatement zones’ within which registered levels of noise from classified
premises may not be increased without their permission. The Act contains
specific provisions to control noise from construction and demolition sites It
also contains provisions enabling individuals to take action against noise
amounting to a nuisance.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and control
measures are aimed at reducing noise at source, through requirements limiting
t e noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may make, and at protecting people
rom its effects. The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 set
out the permissible noise levels for various classes of vehicles when new and
when in use. More stringent limits will begin to take effect for new vehicles in
i yoo.
Under the Land Compensation Act 1973 and similar legislation in Scotland,
compensation is payable for loss in property values caused by physical factors
including noise arising from the use of new or improved public works such as
roads and airports. Regulations made under the Acts also enable highway

authorities to carry out or make grants for insulation of homes subject to
specified levels of increased noise caused by new or improved roads. Noise
insulation may also be provided where construction work for new roads is likely
to seriously affect nearby homes.
Noise emission levels of almost all aircraft on the United Kingdom Register of
Civil Aircraft are regulated in accordance with standards agreed by the
International Civil Aviation Organisation. All subsonic jets on the United
Kingdom Register now have to meet the noise certification criteria, while jets on
overseas registers entering Britain must meet these criteria by 1 January 1988.
Various operational restrictions have been introduced to reduce noise disturb¬
ance further, and people living in the worst affected areas round a number of
airports may be eligible for noise insulation grants.
Radiation resulting from industrial and other processes represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is exposed from the natural environ¬
ment. Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to stringent control because of
possible effects on health or longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1960 users of radioactive materials other than those subject to
licence under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 must be registered by the
appropriate department, and authorisation is also required for the disposal of
radioactive waste. The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned with the granting of
nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence granted by the Executive. The
National Radiological Protection Board established under the Radiological
Protection Act 1970 provides an authoritative point of reference on radiological
protection.
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and level of activity, and the practices
followed reflect this variation. Some wastes are dispersed safely in the
environment. The Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive is responsible
for developing and operating disposal facilities for solid wastes with a low or
intermediate level of activity; four possible sites had been identified by early
1986 and exploratory geological investigations are being carried out to confirm
their suitability for development as disposal facilities only for low-level radio¬
active wastes. A study by independent consultants, commissioned by the
Department of the Environment, into the best practicable environmental
options for the management of radioactive waste, was completed in early 1986.
It examined all the main options for the disposal and storage of low-level and
intermediate-level wastes in the light of a range of assumptions about future
growth in nuclear power and the level of reprocessing, and demonstrated that
for every type of such waste, several storage and disposal options are practical
and safe. Research is also being carried out, in collaboration with other
countries, into disposal of high-level wastes, but these will first be stored in
vitrified form for at least 50 years.
9 Religion
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship and
observance) without interference from the community or the State. Churches
and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their
beliels in speech and writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the
holding of public office.
There are two established churches, that is, churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State: in England the (Anglican) Church of England, and
in Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Clergy of the established
churches work in services administered by the State, such as the armed forces,
national hospitals and prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other
denominations are also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds. The
churches involvement in broader social issues and the practical help they give to
groups of many kinds—from young people to the bereaved and homeless—was
highlighted in the Church of England report Faith in the City: A Call for Action
by Church and Nation, published in 1985, which made recommendations for
alleviating the problems of the inner cities and other areas of social deprivation.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are normally made about religious beliefs in
censuses or other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in
counting its members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore
approximate.
About one-sixth of the adult population in Britain are members of a Christian
church and there are considerable regional variations in church membership:
England has the lowest membership with 13 per cent, Wales has 23 per cent,
Scotland 37 per cent, and Northern Ireland the highest with 80 per cent.
There has been a decline in recent years in both the number of full¬
time ministers and the recorded adult membership of the larger Christian de¬
nominations. This has been accompanied by a significant growth among
small break-away, independent, or Pentecostal churches and new religious
The Church of
England
he Church of England's relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain duties which
it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the Church and
promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an
oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate its own worship The
two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan
bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church (together with those of
the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church)
are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces; Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses (includ¬
ing the Diocese of Europe), and York, with 14 dioceses. The Archbishop of
Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England’, and the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of
England'. The dioceses are divided into 13,400 parishes. In 1984 it was
estimated that, in the two provinces (excluding the Diocese of Europe), some
204

235,000 people were baptised into the Church; of these 198,000 were under one
year old (33 per cent of live births). In the same year there were 79,600
confirmations. Attendances at services on a normal Sunday are around 1-2
million. Many people who rarely, if ever, attend services, nevertheless regard
themselves as belonging to the Church of England (amounting perhaps to some
60 per cent of the population).
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay members
are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred for the
approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod. Lay members are
associated with church government in the parishes through the ancient office of
churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with such
matters as education, mission, inter-church relations, social questions, recruit¬
ment and training for the ministry, church work at home and overseas and the
care of church buildings, particularly those of historical and architectural
interest. It is also concerned with church schools (which are maintained from
public funds) and colleges of education, theological colleges, and centres for
training women in pastoral work. At present, men only are admitted to the
priesthood, but in 1984 the General Synod voted in favour of legislation being
prepared to enable women to be ordained priests; final decisions on the matter,
however, are not expected to be taken for some years.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
church property and matters of ecclesiastical discipline.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for
training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church's endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the
payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 28 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
70 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church in Scotland,
and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference meets for unofficial consultation
among all Anglican bishops (the next Conference will be held in Canterbury in
1988). Presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference has no
executive authority, but enjoys great prestige, and its findings on doctrine,
discipline, relations with other communions, and attitudes to political and
social questions are widely studied. The Anglican Consultative Council (an
assembly of laymen and clergy as well as bishops) meets every two or three years
and is designed to provide consultations within the Anglican Communion and
to serve as an instrument of common action. The Council will meet in Singapore
in 1987.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government, that is,
government by elders, all (including ministers) of equal rank. Its status as the
national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707, and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.

205
The Free
Churches
Both men and women are admitted to the ministry and each of 1 758
churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and
the elected elders of the Church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the
Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly,
consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually under the
presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is
represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The adult
communicant membership of the Church of Scotland is over 870,500.
The expression ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe those Protestant
churches in Britain which, unlike the Church of England and the Church of
Scotland, are not established. In the course of history they have developed their
own convictions in church order and worship. All the major Free Churches—
Methodist, Baptist, United Reformed and Salvation Army—admit both men and
women to the ministry.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with nearly 500 000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evangeli¬
cal revival under John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not join the
union include the Independent Methodists (4,100 members) and the Wesleyan
Reform Union (with some 3,300 members). The Methodist Church in Ireland
has over 21,000 members in Northern Ireland.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of which
belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in 1813) with a
total membership of about 168,300. In addition, there are separate Baptist
Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some 136,000 members, was formed in
1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community ol dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth centuiy. In 1981 there was a further union with
the Re-formed Association of the Churches of Christ
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (with
some 132,800 regular communicants in Ireland); the Presbyterian (or Calvin-
istic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led
in 1735 by Howell Harris; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of
Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church
of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States as Disciples
of Christ) which have been an organised community in Britain since the early
nineteenth century; the British Province of the Moravian Church which is an
international missionaiy church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed
Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford
Movement; and the Congregational Federation, formed from Congregational
Churches which did not enter the United Reformed Church. There are also the
Pentecostalists, who are increasing in numbers. Their two main bodies
operating in Britain are the Assemblies of God and the Elim Pentecostal Church
many of whose members are of West Indian origin. There are also a growing
number of black-led churches.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with about 17,500 adult members
in Britain and 450 places of worship, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. Silent worship is

central to its life as a religious organisation and Friendawork for peace and the
relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 88 other
countries. Within Britain there are 55,000 active members operating from
nearly 1,000 centres of worship. The Salvation Army’s distinctive ministry of
Christian evangelism and practical care is also expressed through the work of
170 social service centres, ranging from hostels for the homeless to homes for
the elderly, for abused children and for teenagers on probation, and recreational
centres for Service personnel.
A recent development in Christian worship has been the house church
movement, which began in the early 1970s and now has an estimated
membership of over 180,000. Each house church has an average of 100
members, the majority of whom are former members of various Protestant
denominations; groups of between 15 and 20 members hdld services and prayer
meetings in private houses, with the position of chairman being taken in
rotation. House churches receive money from their members to enable them to
support their leaders and carry out missionary and social work.
There are also a number of other religious organisations in Britain all of which
were founded in the United States in the last century. These include the
Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christian Scientists and the Spiritualists.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tempo¬
rarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each
under an archbishop, 29 episcopal dioceses (21 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland), and over 3,000 parishes. In Northern Ireland, there are six dioceses,
some with territory partly in the Irish Republic. It is estimated that there are
some 5-7 million adherents to the Roman Catholic faith in Britain. Men only are
admitted to the priesthood. In 1982 Pope John Paul II paid a pastoral visit to
Britain, the first by a reigning pontiff.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. A number of schools for Catholic children are staffed by members
of the religious orders (to the extent of one teacher in 20). These orders also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct
of homes for old people. The great majority of Catholic schools are maintained
out of public funds and new schools may be established with government
grants.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman Conquest, but the
present community in Britain dates from 1656, having been founded by those of
Spanish and Portuguese origin (known as Sephardim). Later and more
numerous settlers were of German and eastern European origin, known as
Ashkenazim. The present community, numbering about 385,000, is the second
largest in Europe.
The community is, broadly speaking, divided into two groups. About 80 per
cent of the majority Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and most acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Chief Rabbi, with the Sephardi Orthodox element following
their own spiritual head (the Haham). The Reform movement which was
founded in 1840 and the Liberal and Progressive movement which followed in
1901 account for the remaining 20 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number about 350. Jewish denominational
schools (some of them supported by public funds) are attended by about one in

three Jewish children. There are a number of charitable and welfare agencies
caring for the aged and handicapped.
The officially recognised representative body is the Board of Deputies of
British Jews.
Other
Religious
Communities
Co-operation
among the
Churches
Christian communities of foreign origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries, together with the Armenian
Church, have established their own centres of worship, particularly in London.
Britain has a long tradition of religious tolerance, a feature which has been
much in evidence during the past 30 years with the acceptance of a wide variety
of religious beliefs and traditions brought in by substantial numbers of
immigrants of different nationalities. There are now large and growing
communities of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, and arrangements have been made
in places of work to allow the members of non-Christian religions to follow their
religious observances.
Britain’s Muslim population is estimated at around 1-5 million, the largest
number of whom originate from Pakistan and Bangladesh, with sizeable groups
from India, Cyprus, the Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. There is also a
growing community of British-born Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, but including an increasing number of converts to Islam. The Islamic
Cultural Centre (and London Central Mosque) on the edge of Regent’s Park is the
most important Muslim institution in the Western world, and there are over
1,000 mosques and prayer centres throughout Britain.
There are an estimated 175,000 members of the Sikh religion and over
140,000 followers of Hinduism in Britain. Both groups originate from India and
each has 150 or more temples throughout the country. The Hindu Centre in
London provides religious and social services as well as meeting the cultural
needs of the Indian community.
There are well over 100 Buddhist groups and centres and at least seven
monasteries and a number of temples. All schools of Buddhism are represented.
The Buddhist Society, with its headquarters in London, publicises the
principles of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice; it adheres to
no one school of Buddhism.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all the
main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action and
seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian Aid
(which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission; Ecumenical
Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches of England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
Inter-church conversations about the doctrinal and practical issues involved
in the search for unity now take place through international as well as national
bodies. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches are represented on some of
these as well as the Anglican and some of the Free Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches also participate in the World
Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches is an associated
national council). This links together some 300 churches in over 100 countries
for co-operation and the study of common problems. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding among members of the two religions
and deals with problems in the social field. The British Council of Churches has
also established a Committee for Relations with People of Other Faiths.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made by
two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
10 National
Economy
In 1986 the British economy entered its sixth year of sustained growth from the
low point of the recession in May 1981. This represented the longest upswing
since 1945. Inflation has fallen, investment, exports and productivity have risen
substantially and the current account of the balance of payments has remained
in surplus. However, unemployment has continued to rise throughout the
period although, since early 1983, the rate of increase has fallen and the number
of people in work has risen.
ECONOMIC
BACKGROUND
Britain has an open economy, in which international trade is a vital part of
economic performance. In 1985 exports of goods and services accounted for
about one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP), one of the highest shares in
t e major economies. The proportion has increased over the last two decades
from about 20 per cent in the early 1960s. Similar rises have occurred in most
other developed countries, reflecting the growing importance of international
trade in an increasingly interdependent world economy.
The economy is primarily based on private enterprise, and government policy
is aimed at encouraging the private sector, which accounts for three-quarters of
GDP and a similar proportion of total employment.
The traditional economic strength of Britain, as a pioneer in the industrial
revolution, has been manufacturing. However, the period since 1945 has seen a
marked rise in living standards and, as in other major developed countries, the
increase that has taken place in real disposable income has led to a faster growth
of demand for services than for manufactures. An adjustment to the relative size
of the manufacturing sector has also resulted from the growth of North Sea oil
output. Services now account for nearly three-fifths of GDP and of employment,
compared with just under half in 1950, while manufacturing accounts for about
a quarter, compared with just over one-third in 1950.
Some 2-5 per cent of Britain's employed labour force is engaged in
agriculture—a lower proportion than in any other major industrialised country.
However because of a high level of productivity, Britain is able to produce nearly
two-thirds of its own food. J
ritains energy position has been transformed in the last decade. With the
iscoveiy and exploitation of oil and natural gas from the Continental Shelf
under the North Sea, the country has become self-sufficient in energy in net
!ea?iS'J°^ether' thC 011 and gaS sectors accounted for 5 to 6 per cent of GDP in
1985. Coal—traditionally the most important source of energy—still accounts
lor over a third of Britain’s needs.
One of the world s largest exporters of visible goods, Britain accounts for about
5 per cent of the total. It is among the major exporters of aerospace products,
eectrica equipment, most types of machinery, chemicals and oil. It is also one of
e world s largest importers of agricultural products, raw materials and
semi-manufactures.
The broad historical pattern of Britain’s overseas trade has been a deficit on
visible trade offset by a surplus on transactions in invisibles. The significant
contribution made by invisibles to the current account is partly a reflection of

Britain’s position as a major financial centre. The banks, insurance under¬
writers and brokers, and other financial institutions of the City of London
provide world-wide financial services, and the City contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
The marked rise in living standards experienced since 1945 has been
accompanied by the emergence of new industries and the renewal and
improvement of much of the country's infrastructure. At the same time, in spite
of short periods of rapid economic expansion, the rate of growth has been low in
comparison with the rates in most other industrialised countries, averaging 2 to
3 per cent annually up to 1973 but only about 1 per cent from then until the
recession of the early 1980s. Since then, however, the underlying rate of growth
has been some 3 per cent a year. In 1985 Britain had the highest rate of growth
among member countries of the European Community. »
From the late 1960s until about 1980 high levels of inflation reduced Britain's
competitiveness. Huge rises in the price of oil in 1973—74 and 1979 and
substantial increases in the money supply and public spending were followed by
upsurges in inflation; retail prices rose by 24 per cent in 1975 and by 18 per cent
in 1980. Earnings also grew rapidly; in 1980 the underlying rate of increase was
about 21 per cent. From 1981 inflation declined and, in the years 1983-85,
remained at an annual rate of 5 to 6 per cent, falling to 2-4 per cent by July 1986.
Over the same period earnings rose at an underlying rate of 7 to 8 per cent a
year.
In the late 1970s competitiveness suffered from a much more rapid increase in
unit labour costs than in most other industrialised countries, as well as a
marked appreciation in sterling, which rose by 18 per cent between 1978 and
1980. Partly as a result of weakness in the world oil market, sterling then
depreciated; between 1980 and 1984 the value fell by 18 per cent but the average
level in 1985 was the same as in 1984. With a further decline in oil prices in late
1985 and early 1986, the fall in sterling was resumed; it depreciated by 4 per
cent between the end of 1985 and the middle of 1986. Sterling depreciation,
together with greater moderation in pay settlements and a substantial rise in
productivity since the end of 1980 (see p 211), led to a considerable improve¬
ment in competitiveness; between early 1981 and late 1985 Britain's unit labour
costs, adjusted for movements in the exchange rate, fell by one-quarter.
In the decade to 1973 output of the manufacturing industries grew at a faster
rate than the economy as a whole. After the oil price rises of 1973-74, however,
and with increasing competition from overseas—from both developed and newly
industrialising countries—manufacturing output fell sharply so that in 1975 it
was 8 per cent lower than two years previously. Output then increased from this
trough but, following another oil price rise and stagnation in the world
economy, fell back in the period 1979 to 1981. It has since risen every year and is
now growing at an underlying annual rate of about 3 per cent although it
remains below the level of the mid-1970s. However, output of the production
industries as a whole (manufacturing, energy and water) was at its highest ever
in 1985. In that year energy output was more than twice the level of ten years
earlier.
Fixed investment grew by about 5 per cent a year during the 1960s but between
1970 and 1983 it held steady apart from cyclical variations. Fixed investment
was higher in 1984 and 1985. however, influenced by rising company profits
and an acceleration in anticipation of the reductions in capital allowances
announced in the 1984 Budget. Although, with a falling oil price, profits of oil

companies declined in 1985, profits (net of stock appreciation) of non-oil
industrial and commercial companies were 30 per cent higher than in 1984. A
further influence may have been increased capacity utilisation as Britain
recovered from recession since 1981. Over the period 1975 to 1985 there was an
increase in the private sector s share of total investment (excluding transactions
in existing dwellings and land) from 58 to 79 per cent. Over the same period the
share of investment undertaken by the services sector increased from 40 to 49
per cent while that of manufacturing fell from 16 to 13 per cent.
Britain has an employed labour force of some 24 million. The number of jobs in
the economy is increasing; between early 1983 and late 1985 employment rose
by over 700,000 while self-employment is at its highest level since 1921. There
has also been a large growth in the working population; demographic factors
have meant that the number of people reaching working age has exceeded that
reaching retirement age, and there has also been a rise in the number of women
seeking work. As a result, no corresponding fall in unemployment has occurred.
As in other industrialised countries, this has proved an intractable problem
since the early 1970s. From a level of 300,000 to 400,000 in the mid-1960s,
unemployment rose to over 1 million in the late 1970s (representing around 5 to
6 per cent of all employees) and then increased again very sharply after 1979 to
reach 3 million by the end of 1982. The rate of increase has since slowed; by July
1986 unemployment was 3-2 million, equal to 11-7 per cent of the working
population.
Although unemployment remains high, other labour market indicators have
improved. Overtime in manufacturing has risen and short-time working has
fallen. The parallel to rising unemployment has been increasing productivity.
Shedding of surplus labour has led to gains in efficiency; between 1980 and
1985 output per head rose by 14 per cent in the economy as a whole and by 27
per cent in manufacturing alone.
Britain's overseas trade performance fluctuated during the 1970s. In general,
imports of food, energy, raw materials and manufactured goods were greater
than visible exports, which were largely manufactured goods. This deficit on
visible trade was wholly or partly offset by a surplus on invisibles, which cover
earnings from services, together with interest, profits and dividends, and
transfers.
In the years 1980 to 1982 Britain ran surpluses on visible trade. Since then,
however, with the economy recovering from recession, imports—especially of
manufactures—have risen more sharply than exports and the .deficit on visible
trade has reappeared. After a long period of deterioration in the balance of trade
in manufactures there was a deficit in 1983—the first since 1945. The deficit
continued in the following two years. Substantial net earnings on invisible
trade, however, have kept the current account in surplus.
Membership of the European Community from 1973 has had a major impact
on Britain’s pattern of trade, increasing the proportion with other member
countries and reducing the share of Commonwealth trade. Between 1972 and
1985 the proportion of Britain’s exports of goods going to other member
countries of the Community rose from 30 to 46 per cent while that going to other
Commonwealth countries fell from 19 to 11 per cent. Imports followed a similar
trend. Trade with the newly industrialising countries, including Singapore,
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, has risen substantially.
The strength of overseas earnings from invisibles has been maintained by the
continued adaptation to new conditions, particularly following the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979, and growth in world markets of insurance, banking,
tourism, construction, consultancy and other services. In 1985 exports of
212
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
services were valued at about one-third of exports of goods; the growth of
overseas assets has resulted in high net receipts of investment income.
The substantial cumulative surplus on current account from 1980 onwards
implies a corresponding increase in Britain’s net external assets, which are
estimated to have risen from £12,500 million at the end of 1979 to about
£90,000 million at the end of 1985. Following the abolition of exchange controls
in 1979, investment outflows, particularly portfolio investment, increased
sharply. There has been an acceleration in the growth of portfolio investment
since 1984, partly a reflection of investment by banks as they moved into lending
in readily marketable forms (such as floating rate notes) and away from
traditional loans. British banks’ sterling lending abroad has also been at a high
level since the abolition of exchange controls.
Oil The development of North Sea oil and gas production has had a significant effect
on the economy; in 1986 Britain was the world's fifth largest oil producer. The
benefits to the balance of payments began to appear in the second half of the
1970s; in 1980 Britain had its first surplus on oil trade. By 1985 the surplus
amounted to £8,200 million. In 1974 oil accounted for some 4 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports and 19 per cent of visible imports; by 1985 the
proportions were 21 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Exports, mainly to
other European Community countries, are equivalent to more than half of
domestic production. They are partly offset in balance of payments terms by
imports of other grades of crude oil from the Middle East and elsewhere.
North Sea oil helped to alleviate the fall in real national income which Britain,
along with other industrialised countries, suffered following the oil price rises of
the 1970s. It has helped to ease the task of controlling public sector borrowing,
contributing to the Government’s counter-inflation strategy. Even after produc¬
tion runs down, the stock of external assets (see above) that has been built up
largely because of North Sea oil will provide a steady flow of income.
The price of oil fell sharply in early 1983 and, after almost three years of virtual
stability, again in late 1985 and early 1986. Although a fall in the oil price may
lead to some loss of revenues from oil exports and oil taxation, consumers and
non-oil industry can be expected to benefit.
Sterling As a reflection of Britain's position as a net oil exporter, sterling has been strong
during periods of high world demand for oil. Sterling appreciated markedly in
1979 and 1980, with rising oil prices, but, as the oil market weakened, sterling
fell back. The sterling index shows the value of the currency as a weighted
average (1975 = 100) of its exchange rate against other currencies. In July 1986
the index was 75-9 compared with an average of 96-1 in 1980.
ECONOMIC In the decades after 1945 British governments sought to influence the rate of
STRATEGY growth and the level of employment by macroeconomic policy measures (for
example, by variations in government expenditure, taxes or controls on
consumer credit). At the same time they attempted to keep inflation down and to
achieve approximate equilibrium in the balance of payments. However, each
time the economy expanded, inflation tended to accelerate and a strong rise in
imports typically gave rise to a balance of payments problem. The effects would
finally lead to the imposition of restraints on home demand. The cyclical pattern
of stimulus followed by restraint became known as ‘stop-go’.
From the late 1960s until about 1980, fluctuations in wage and price levels
had an adverse effect on competitiveness, profitability and business confidence.
This was associated with an increase in unemployment over the period. At
various times governments attempted to control pay rises and (less frequently)

price rises by means of voluntary or statutory controls, but such policies were
largely unsuccessful.
The Government elected in 1979 has adopted economic policies which in
many ways represent a break with those of earlier governments. Monetary and
fiscal policies are set to bring about lower inflation while providing for continued
growth in output. Microeconomic policies are designed to enhance the prospects
for output and employment by improving incentives, removing unnecessary
controls, ensuring that markets work properly and generally increasing the
adaptability of the economy. The Government believes that the pursuit of these
policies will ensure that the increase since 1983 in the number of jobs in the
economy will be maintained.
Controlling the growth of the money supply is central to the aim of a sustained
fall in the rate of inflation. Among the money supply measures, targets are set for
increases in the MO narrow liquidity measure and the sterling M3 broad
liquidity measure.1 The target ranges for these are 2 to 6 per cent and 11 to 15
per cent respectively in 1986-87.
Increased competition in financial markets, however, resulting from de¬
regulation, has led to a change in the pattern of financial transactions. The
growth of interest-bearing sight deposits has meant that people are more willing
to use these deposits as a form of investment while building societies are
tending to hold an increased proportion of their reserves as bank deposits
These developments mean that sterling M3 is less reliable than previously as a
guide to potential spending. The monetaiy indicators, therefore, form only part
of the Government s overall judgment on monetary conditions. Other variables,
particularly short-term interest rates and the exchange rate, are also taken into
account.
While designing macroeconomic policy with the intent of reducing inflation, the
Government has sought to improve the supply response, and hence the
efficiency, of the economy through microeconomic policies. Action has been
taken to expose more of the economy to market forces. Direct controls (for
example, on pay, prices, foreign exchange, dividend payments and commercial
credit) have been abolished, competition in domestic markets strengthened,
labour market reforms introduced and a substantial programme of transferring
activities from the public to the private sector is under way. In addition,
regulatory burdens on business are being reduced.
In the labour market the Government has sought to improve work incentives
by reducing personal income tax rates and raising tax thresholds and also by
encouraging the extension of share ownership among employees. Wide-ranging
reforms of personal taxation have been proposed in a Green Paper. To improve
employment prospects, the Government has also abolished the National
Insurance surcharge (a tax on employed labour) and established a graduated
structure of National Insurance contribution rates which has reduced the cost
to employers of hiring lower-paid workers. The Government has also taken steps
to achieve a better-balanced legal framework for industrial relations and is
working to improve vocational training. Obstacles to the mobility of labour have
been reduced. For example, the rights of those leaving occupational pension
schemes early have been improved, thus bringing down the costs of changing
jobs. Among the objectives of a proposed reform of the social security system is
an improvement in incentives to work and save. The Government has

introduced legislation to limit the scope of wages councils. However, in spite of
these measures and although unemployment has remained at a high level,
wages have continued to rise in excess of the inflation rate. This has taken place
despite the Government's emphasis on the link between pay and jobs: it has
repeatedly warned that, if employment is to rise faster, wages must rise more
slowly.
To improve the working of capital markets, the Government has abolished
controls on foreign exchange transactions, company dividends, hire purchase
and bank lending. Competition among financial institutions is being encour¬
aged within a new statutory framework of investor protection. The Government
is also taking steps to reduce the distorting effects of the tax system on
investment and savings decisions by, among other things, reducing corporation
tax and the system of capital allowances. Planning restrictions on industrial
investment have been eased, while industrial subsidies (both generally and in
the context of regional policy) have been made more selective and more closely
related to job creation. Particular efforts have been made to improve the flow of
investment funds to small firms and to assist innovation in industry.
Monetary policy has been complemented by a firm fiscal policy whose aim has
been a progressive reduction in public borrowing as a proportion of GDP. In the
early years of the financial strategy the public sector borrowing requirement
amounted to around 3 per cent of GDP but by 1985—86 this had fallen to 2-25
per cent—the lowest since 1971—72. Further reductions are envisaged.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for the formulation and conduct of
economic policy, which also involves the Departments of Trade and Industry,
Employment, Energy, the Environment and Transport and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Other bodies are concerned with specific
aspects of economic policy. These include the Bank of England (the central
bank), the National Economic Development Council (in which the Govern¬
ment meets representatives of industry under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister), the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and on
the economic problems it faces, the Government makes known its purposes and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests
with the Cabinet.
The value of all goods and services produced in the economy is measured by
GDP. This can be expressed either in terms of market prices (the prices people
pay for the goods and services they buy) or at factor cost (the cost of the goods
and services before adding taxes and subtracting subsidies). It can also be
expressed in current prices or in constant prices (that is, removing the effects of
inflation in order to measure the underlying growth in the economy). In 1985,
GDP at current factor cost totalled £304,400 million.
Gross domestic product is conventionally estimated in three different ways as
the sum totals of expenditures, incomes or outputs in a given year. Each method
yields the same total in principle, but in practice there are slight differences.
Over the longer term the average of the three is the best indicator of growth in
the economy. The output measure is usually considered the most reliable
measure of short-term movements. In 1985 the index of the average estimate of
GDP at constant factor cost was 110-5 (1980 = 100), compared with 92-0 in
1975, an increase of some 20 per cent.

Personal incomes at current prices before tax rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £97,335 million in 1975 to £309,908 million in 1985. Personal disposable
income (that is, personal incomes after deductions—mainly taxation and
National Insurance contributions) was £239,781 million in 1985, 2-8 per cent
higher in real terms than in 1984. Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 70 per
cent of pre-tax personal income in 1985 compared with 67 per cent in 1975.
Table 12 shows the pattern of consumers’expenditure in 1985. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, clothing and footwear, and fuel and power together accounted
for 48 per cent of the total. Consumers’ expenditure increased by 3-5 per cent in
real terms between 1984 and 1985. The changes in the pattern between 1975
and 1985 in Britain were paralleled in other industrialised countries, with
declining proportions spent on food, and on clothing and footwear. Over the

longer term, as incomes rise (real personal disposable income in Britain having
more than doubled since 1945), people tend to spend increasing proportions on
consumer durables and services—personal, financial and leisure services in
particular.
Saving as a percentage of personal disposable income has fluctuated over the
last decade and was lower in 1985 (111 per cent) than in 1975 (12-7 per cent).
(Movements in the personal savings ratio may reflect people's wish to compen¬
sate for the rise or fall in the real value of assets fixed in money terms in response
to changes in price levels.)
The proportion of total personal income accounted for by income from
employment was 64 per cent in 1985; average gross weekly earnings in April
1985 in Great Britain were £187-90 for full-time male workers and £123-90 for
full-time female workers. The three other main sources of personal income were
self-employment (10 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (10 per
cent) and current grants from general government (15 per cent).
Current expenditure on goods and services by central government and local
authorities amounted to £74,012 million in 1985; it rose by 10 per cent in real
terms over the period 1975 to 1985. The main cause of this was the growth over
the period in the social services, especially education and the National Health
Service.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
National Insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies. Central government also makes grants to local authorities to finance
about half of their current expenditure.
Table 13 shows GDP by industry in 1975 and 1985. Over a period of time
agriculture and manufacturing have come to account for smaller proportions of
national income, while energy and services have grown relatively. Services now
account for about 60 per cent of GDP.

11 Framework
of Industry
Among the most prominent trends in industrial activity in Britain during the
1970s and 1980s have been the growth of the offshore oil and gas industries
together with related products and services; the rapid development of electronic
and microelectronic technologies and their application to a wide range of other
sectors; and a continuous rise in the service industries’ share of total
employment. Industrial output in Britain has twice been affected by recession
since 1973, partly as a result of fluctuations in oil prices. Output declined for
two years after 1973, and then recovered steadily until 1979. It fell again in 1980
and 1981, increased in 1982 and has risen strongly since then. A marked
increase in productivity has been a major factor in easing the process of
economic recovery. In early 1986 total output was 14 per cent higher than at the
low point of the recession in early 1981. Gains in productivity, however, meant
that this increased output was produced with fewer workers. Consequently,
employment, though increasing, was still lower than in 1981. Table 14 shows
gross domestic product (GDP) by sector and the percentage of total GDP and of
total employment in each sector in 1985.

The Government is pursuing policies designed to help British industry
become more competitive and responsive to market forces, both at home and
abroad (see p 227), and also to encourage development in advanced industries
such as microelectronics and biotechnology. These objectives are also borne in
mind by the Government when participating in the formulation of European
Community industrial policies.
This chapter describes some of the general features of industrial organisation
in Britain, such as the forms of enterprise, methods of financing and industrial
association. It looks at factors affecting productivity and competitiveness.

including investment, technological advance, research and development, and
management and workforce training, as well as means of improving standards
of design and quality assurance. It also outlines the framework of incentives for
general industrial development provided by the Government, and by Community
institutions, and the regulatory framework within which industry operates.
The forms of industrial organisation and the patterns of ownership and control
are varied. The main categories of organisation are: unincorporated businesses
(sole traders and partnerships) of which there are at least 1 million; incor¬
porated companies; and public sector enterprises, which are owned by the
Government (see p 228). Incorporation means that companies are entered on an
official register of companies (see p 238); at the end of 1985 there were over 1
million companies on the registers, though a proportion of these were not
actively trading. About 6,000 of these companies were public limited companies.
There are about 16 major public sector enterprises with an employed labour
force of 1 -3 million. The Government is pursuing a programme of‘privatisation'
whereby some of these enterprises are transformed into incorporated companies
and their shares sold to the public (see p 229). Employees in such companies are
being given a preferential right to buy shares in their new companies and
employee share ownership in general has been facilitated by changes in
legislation, thus enabling employees to have a financial interest in the
profitability of their companies. Although not numerous, co-operative enter¬
prises (which are also incorporated companies) increased in number from 300
in 1979 to 1,400 in mid-1986, and since 1980 there has been a rise in the
number of‘buy-outs’ in which the staff, or management, of a company raises the
finance to purchase it.
In some sectors a small number of large companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a large proportion of total production. However, it is rare for a few
shareholders to have a controlling interest since shares in these companies are
usually distributed among many holders or held by insurance companies or
pension funds representing a cross-section of the community.
Private enterprises account for about 75 per cent of GDP in Britain and for the
greater part of activity in the agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and miscellaneous service sectors. There is substantial
public ownership in the energy, transport and communications sectors.
Unincorporated businesses, corporate enterprises and public sector enterprises
contribute about 20, 55 and 8 per cent of GDP respectively (the remainder being
accounted for by central and local government).
About 100 companies registered in Britain each had net assets of over £500
million in 1985. In terms of annual sales three of the top ten industrial groups in
Europe were British, with British Petroleum second. Shell Transport and
Trading third, and BAT Industries seventh. Alongside the larger organisations
the many hundreds of thousands of small firms play an essential part in the
economy.
Over half of companies’ funds for further investment and other purposes are
internally generated, with banks providing the chief external source of finance.
The main forms of short-term finance available in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit, bill financing (essentially a more formal kind of trade
credit) and factoring (making cash available to a company in exchange for its
debts). Types of medium- and long-term finance include bank loans, the
mortgaging of property and the issue of securities and shares to the public
through The Stock Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also be regarded as
a form of finance. Other sources of finance for industry include the Government
(see p 229), the European Community and specialist financial institutions.
FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
221
Industrial
Association
Capital gearing (the ratio of debt to equity) has historically been low relative to
most other countries, reflecting the highly developed stock market in Britain. In
1982 the ratio had fallen to 46 : 100 from 54 : 100 in 1977; for large companies
it had fallen faster, to 40 : 100 in 1984.
The 1980s have been particularly notable for the growth of venture capital
schemes run by financial institutions in both the public and private sectors to
provide ‘start-up' and development finance for small and new firms. The
organisation of an Unlisted Securities Market and over-the-counter markets has
enabled fast-developing young companies to raise capital through share issues
even if they are not eligible for a full Stock Exchange listing
There are several types of voluntary association representing private enterprises
and covering, with varying degrees of completeness, most of British industry.
The central body representing British business and industry is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). The CBI represents about 250,000 businesses,
directly or indirectly (through employers’ organisations and trade associations),
as well as the majority of public sector enterprises. For its members, it acts as an
advisory and consultative body, providing them with information and statistics,
ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally to the
Covernment and public as well as internationally. CBI representatives sit on
such bodies as the National Economic Development Council, the Manpower
Services Commission and the Health and Safety Commission.
Chambers of commerce are open to producers and traders of all kinds and are
organised on a geographical basis. They exist to provide export assistance as
well as advisory and information services and training courses. There are 85
local chambers of commerce, representing 55,000 firms, affiliated to regional
associations and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Additional
central organisations serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Trade associations consist of companies producing or retailing a particular
product or group of products, and about 650 major associations are listed by the
Department of Employment. They exist to provide common services, regulate
trading practices and represent their members to government departments.
mployers organisations are usually concerned with the negotiation of wages
and conditions of work in a particular industrial sector, although sometimes
one institution may undertake the function of both a trade association and an
employers’ organisation.
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations for
particular regions or areas and the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
in Scotland. ^
PRODUCTIVITY
AND
COMPETITIVE¬
NESS
Although output per head in Britain has generally been low by international
standards, it has risen sharply since 1981. The rise for manufacturing has been
greater than for the economy as a whole. The index for the whole economy in
5 was 113-8 (1980 - 100). Table 15 shows the output and employment
indices for 1984 and 1985. There was a fall in employment in production
industries between these years, but this was more than offset by a rise in
employment in service industries, which led to an overall increase. Output and
output per head in both production and service industries rose between 1984
and 1985. The Government believes that the increased competitiveness
resultmg from these productivity gains will lead to a sustained rise in living
standards and a rise in employment.
Among the factors affecting productivity are capital investment, innovations
and improvements in products and processes, and the performance and
training of management and labour. The following sections outline trends and
developments in these areas.

Excluding self-employment.
Total fixed capital expenditure increased by 2 per cent between 1984 and 1985
in real terms. In the recession of 1979—81, investment fell by almost 14 per cent,
but began to recover in 1982. The fall occurred mainly in manufacturing
investment, which fell substantially between 1979 and 1983, recovering
significantly in 1984 and 1985. Investment in distribution, financial services
and transport fell slightly between 1979 and 1981, but otherwise has shown a
consistent rising trend. Investment in major sectors of the economy in 1985 (at
1980 prices) is shown in Table 16. The figures for manufacturing industry do
not include expenditure on leased assets since these are attributed to the service
industries on the basis of ownership. Manufacturing industry is, however, the
major user of leased assets. The practice of leasing has grown rapidly since the
early 1970s but is likely to decline owing to changes made in the tax treatment of
capital investment in the 1984 Budget (see p 227).
Britain was a pioneer in both computing and telecommunications and has an
important computer industry. It is among the worlds leading nations in the
production and use of micro- and minicomputers as well as in the provision of
computing services and systems. Extensive use of electronics and automated
controls is to be found across the whole range of industry. The use of
computerised control is widespread in steel mills, coal mines, oil refineries and
chemical plants. The use of robots is increasing rapidly, especially in the motor
industry: Britain was the world’s sixth largest user of industrial robots at the
end of 1985 according to the British Robot Association. Greater use of robotics
and of other new technologies such as fibre optics and optoelectronics is
encouraged by various Department of Trade and Industry schemes.
The use of personal computers in offices is now common, and advanced data
transmission systems and databases are being developed. New technology is also
being used in the area of personal banking and sales as electronic funds transfer
at point of sale (EFT-POS) equipment begins to be installed in addition to the
automated teller machines which are now widespread.

British industry has a record of success in biotechnology. The pharmaceuti¬
cals sector is among the world leaders in the production of antibiotics by
fermentation and there has also been steady improvement of fermentation
techniques in the production of food and beverages. Biotechnology has gained a
new impetus from research achievements in genetic engineering and cell fusion.
The Department of Trade and Industry and other government bodies are
encouraging the exploitation of new developments. A Biotechnology Unit at the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist is the focus for government co-operation
with industry.
The British Technology Group (BTG) promotes the industrial application of
developments of all kinds made in public sector research institutions and
universities (see p 230). Some of the major technical achievements which it has
exploited or supported are cephalosporin antibiotics, pyrethroid insecticides,
glass-reinforced cement, carbon fibre and advanced integrated circuits.
Research and Industrial expenditure on research and development in 1983 was £4 163
Development million, of which £3,637 million was spent by private sector companies and
£526 million by public sector companies and by some 40 research associations
formed by groups of companies in a particular sector. The main areas of
expenditure were electronics (£1,463 million), chemicals and allied products
(£735 million), aerospace (£720 million), mechanical engineering (£290 mil¬
lion), and motor vehicles (£240 million).
Estimated outturn figures for government-funded research and development
in 1984-85 include: Ministry of Defence, £2,106 million; Department of Trade
and Industry, £365 million; Science and Engineering Research Council, £269
million; Department of Energy and United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority,
£232 million; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, £126 million;
Agricultural and Food Research Council, £46 million; and Department of
Transport, £35 million.
The Government has sponsored a major programme in advanced information
technology, known as the Alvey programme, which comprises research projects

involving collaboration between industry, academic institutions and other
research organisations. The programme runs over the years 1983—88 with a
total budget of £350 million, over half of which is being provided by the
Government. The four main areas of research are software engineering,
man—machine interfaces, very large-scale integrated circuits and intelligent
knowledge-based systems. By the end of 1985, most of the funds were
committed to over 230 projects with, typically, two or three firms and one or two
universities taking part in each project. Over 60 firms, 40 universities, six
polytechnics and six research establishments are now involved in the pro¬
gramme. The European Community's research programme into the develop¬
ment and application of information technologies, the European Strategic
Programme of Research into Information Technology (ESPRIT), has a budget of
1,500 million ECUs1 (£1,030 million) for the five years 1984—89, of which 50 per
cent will be provided by the Community. British compahies are participating in
a large proportion of the projects.
The BRITE programme (Basic Research in Industrial Technology) is a
Community project designed to encourage collaborative research into applica¬
tions of advanced technology in some of the more traditional industries and has
substantial British participation. It has a budget of 125 million ECUs (£85
million) over the four years 1985—88.
Many British companies are participating in projects in the Eureka pro¬
gramme, which aims to encourage European co-operation in the development
and production of high technology products with global sales potential, and
which has the support of 18 European governments and the European
Commission.
Management education is provided by all the polytechnics and many colleges of
further education, while Regional Management Centres have been established
in England and Wales by associations of some of these colleges, with some
similar organisations in Scotland. Universities make an important contribu¬
tion, especially through the full-time postgraduate programmes at business
schools such as those of London, Manchester, City, Durham and Strathclyde
universities. Training courses for managers are offered by several independent
colleges, including the Management College, Henley-on-Thames, Ashridge
College, Berkhamsted, and the Cranfield School of Management, Bedford. The
British Institute of Management, which has a representative role for the
management and administrative professions, has a particular interest in
management training, while there are also a number of professional bodies
concerned with standards and training in specialised branches of management.
The Engineering Council was established under Royal Charter in 1981. Its
objectives are to advance education in, and to promote the science and practice
of, engineering (including relevant technology) for the public benefit and thereby
promote industry and commerce in Britain. The Council maintains a register of
300,000 professional engineers (which includes chartered engineers), techni¬
cian engineers and engineering technicians. In co-operation with the various
professional institutions and other organisations concerned with training in
engineering, it has set standards for education, training and experience, and
accredited courses by which people qualify for registration.
A well-trained workforce is essential for economic growth, and recent technolo¬
gical advances have created a need for an even greater quantity, range and
quality of technical and vocational training, both for young people and for

adults. The main responsibility for training rests with employers and indi¬
viduals. The Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC), a privately
funded body, deals with the education and training of technicians and their
equivalents in the professions and commerce, by designing syllabuses and
validating courses offered at colleges of further education and elsewhere in
England and Wales; its Scottish equivalent is the Scottish Vocational Education
Council. The BTEC is working with the Engineering Council and the Engineer¬
ing Industry Training Board to co-ordinate their systems of assessing and
certifying the skills of those receiving technician education and training, and
with the City and Guilds of London Institute to develop the pre-vocational
courses of the two organisations into a more coherent and comprehensive
system.
The Government is increasing its responsibility for some aspects of training.
It is estimated to have spent some £450 million on this in 1979-80, rising to
nearly £1,500 million in 1985-86. The Manpower Services Commission (MSC),
which consists of representatives of employers, unions and local authority and
educational interests, is the main agency through which the Government
institutes action and monitors progress in training. Its main scheme is the
Youth Training Scheme, which offers a course of planned work experience
integrated with olf-the-job training for unemployed 16- or 17-year-old school-
leavers. The scheme provides two years of training for 16-year-olds and one year
for 17-year-olds, leading to a recognised qualification. The Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative aims at providing four-year courses with a
strong technical and vocational element in schools and colleges for 14- to
18-year-olds. About 85 per cent of education authorities were participating by
1986-87.
The aim of the Government's adult training strategy is to encourage employers
and others to give adult training a high priority and to secure an adequate
supply of people with up-to-date skills. The MSC's adult training schemes are
grouped into two main programmes—the Wider Opportunities Training Pro¬
gramme, a broad-based series of schemes aimed at enhancing unemployed
people s employability, and a Job-Related Programme which aims to enhance
the skills of both employed and unemployed people, including the Job Training
Scheme, which trains unemployed people in skills for which there is a known
local labour demand. Greater emphasis is to be placed in 1986-87 on assistance
to small firms and potential entrepreneurs. The MSC is also encouraging the use
of open learning methods (using video and tapes) on all training courses, and
hopes to establish a broadcasting College of the Air in 1987 to provide vocational
courses below degree level. In 1985-86 the MSC’s adult training schemes helped
over 200,000 people (of whom half were unemployed) and are expected to help
over 250,000 people in 1986-87.
The Open University, which provides degree courses using distance learning
techniques, notably television broadcasts, has set up the Open University
Business School, which offers part-time courses leading to a diploma in
management. The School, which is strongly supported by the British Institute of
Management, has been used by almost 2,000 companies and organisations
since it opened in 1983. Managers continue to work while studying, which is of
particular use to those small companies which cannot afford to release staff on a
full-time basis.
Good design is seen as crucial for maintaining and improving the quality and
competitiveness of goods and services; the Department of Trade and Industry
gives priority to its campaign to encourage greater awareness in industry and
commerce (among both producers and customers) of the value of good design. It
organises conferences to underline the importance of design and has taken

steps to include design education in the school system and widen awareness of
design in business schools. Advice and assistance on design matters are
available from the government-sponsored Design Council, while the Computer-
Aided Design Centre also provides assistance to individual firms. The Design
Council has centres in London, Cardiff and Glasgow, and its operations include
giving advice on design problems; the organisation of product displays at
overseas trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design; providing help for
design education; and the production of a range of publications. A funded
consultancy scheme, operated by the Design Council on behalf of the Govern¬
ment, offers firms employing up to 500 people a maximum of 15 working days’
consultancy at subsidised rates. The Council provides annual awards for
consumer and contract goods, engineering products and components, compu¬
ter software, medical equipment, and motor vehicles and accessories. The
Society of Industrial Artists and Designers is the representative professional
body in Great Britain of industrial designers.
The Government is working for recognition of the importance of standards,
believing that they can serve to improve the quality and thereby the inter¬
national competitiveness of products. In 1983 the Government launched a
long-term National Quality Campaign, supported by a number of non¬
government bodies including the British Standards Institution (BSI—see
below). The campaign has included the setting up in 1984 of a National Quality
Information Centre run by the Institute of Quality Assurance, and assistance to
industry in training and consultancy work associated with quality assurance.
The National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies, set up to assess
certification bodies applying for government accreditation, was established in
1985.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) prepares and publishes standards
which specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing methods and
codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in most fields of
production. It is a voluntary body, working by consensus, and funded by sales of
standards, subscriptions and government grant. The board of the BSI includes
representatives of all sectors of industry (both employers and workers),
professional institutions, consumers and the larger government departments.
The BSI, with government support, co-operates with other countries in
achieving international agreements on standards. A new, faster, approach to
harmonising product standards within the European Community, intended to
help break down internal trade barriers and based on the simple requirement of
safety, was agreed in May 1985.
The National Physical Laboratory (NPL), a research establishment of the
Department of Trade and Industry, is responsible for providing the measure¬
ment standards and calibration facilities necessary to ensure that measure¬
ments in Britain are made on a common basis and to the required accuracy. It
maintains links with national standards laboratories all over the world to ensure
international compatibility in measurements essential for overseas trade and
technological co-operation. Based within the NPL, the National Measurement
Accreditation Service (NAMAS) provides a focal point for the voluntary accredita¬
tion of calibration and testing facilities in Britain. It forms a link between the
national standards maintained by the NPL and accredited measurement
laboratories, including those servicing manufacturers and other producers,
contractors, regulating bodies, quality assessment and product certification
schemes, the Government, the health service and consumer bodies. NAMAS
accredited laboratories offer calibration of scientific instruments and provide

official certificates for electrical, mechanical, flow, optical, pressure, thermal
and time measurements.
The National Weights and Measures Laboratory, also part of the Department of
Trade and Industry, is responsible for administering the Weights and Measures
Act 1985, which is largely concerned with standards and measuring equipment
for use in trade. In 1984 the Government appointed a committee to review the
metrological control of weighing and measuring equipment for commercial use
taking account of the impact of modern technology and trading conditions; the
Government has accepted many of its recommendations, including the intro¬
duction of a ‘self-verification’ scheme for approved manufacturers.
The Department of Trade and Industry is the department chiefly responsible for
relations between the Government and industry. It is responsible for oversight of
several nationalised industries, for industrial science, technology and research,
for industrial policy and assistance, for overseas trade and export promotion, for
competition policy and consumer affairs, for company legislation and for the
Patent Office. In support of these activities it collects comprehensive statistics
through the Business Statistics Office.
The aim of the Government's industrial policy is to increase the national
production of wealth and promote and enhance the vitality and competitiveness
of British trade and industry, within a proper regulatory framework. The heart
of the policy is the control of inflation as the basis for sustained economic
growth and the creation of a social and economic climate conducive to enterprise
and initiative. To this end the Government is reducing the extent of state
ownership, and industrial investment agencies in the public sector have been
encouraged to secure private sector participation in their projects. Competition
policy has been strengthened and other measures have been introduced to
promote efficiency and competitiveness, including campaigns to enhance
standards and quality assurance, to lay greater emphasis on training and skills,
to increase links between industry and education and to remove unnecessary
controls on companies. The Government is also encouraging the development of
small businesses by reducing their administrative burdens, adjusting taxation
and other policies.
Successive governments have aimed to provide an environment favourable to
industrial expansion. In the case of industrial plant and machinery there is an
annual allowance against profits for tax purposes of 25 per cent (on a reducing
balance basis) beginning in the year in which expenditure occurs. There is an
allowance for investment in industrial property of 4 per cent a year (on a
straight-line basis). Special arrangements exist for short life (usually high
technology) assets. There is a 100 per cent allowance for scientific research.
Progressive reductions in the main rate of corporation tax were brought into
effect as a result of the 1984 Budget.
The Department of Trade and Industry’s schemes of assistance to industiy
and commerce were regrouped in April 1985 under four headings: support for
innovation; support for national and regional investment; business and
technical advisoiy services; and support for exports. Assistance provided by the
Department in 1985-86 amounted to about £818 million (compared with some
£895 million in the previous year). Various other agencies in the public sector
provide aid, either for defined activities (such as tourism) or for specific
geographical areas. The latter include inner urban areas, for which the
Government has schemes of social and economic regeneration; enterprise
zones areas in which, as an experiment, economic activity is relieved of certain
tax burdens and administrative controls; and freeports (also experimental) in
which traders are freed from certain customs requirements. This national
industrial assistance is supplemented by assistance from European Community

funds (see p 234). Direct investment from overseas is encouraged, overseas
firms generally being offered the same facilities and incentives as British-based
companies.
The Department of Trade and Industry’s Invest in Britain Bureau provides
foreign companies with advice and assistance on all aspects of locating and
relocating businesses in Britain, and on expanding existing facilities. Britain
has for many years been the leading country for United States manufacturing
investment in Europe and has attracted over one-third of all Japanese
investment in the European Community since 1951.
Recognition of outstanding industrial performance is conferred annually by the
Queen’s Awards for Export and Technology, the Export Awards for Smaller
Manufacturers (for firms employing fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award, the major award for engineering in Britain (made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological innovation). The Queen’s Awards are
made to firms in all sectors of industry (including services) on the advice of a
committee composed of businessmen, trade union representatives and civil
servants.
The major nationalised industries are: the electricity supply industry (including
the Central Electricity Generating Board and 12 area electricity boards in
England and Wales); the British Gas Corporation; British Coal; the British Steel
Corporation; British Rail; and the Post Office. In total the industries account for
around 7-7 per cent of GDP and employ about 6 per cent of all employees.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not civil
servants although they are responsible to ministers who appoint the chairman
and members of each board. Ministers are responsible for agreeing with the
industries their general strategies and have the power to give general directions
as to how the industry should be run, but do not interfere in day-to-day
management. The Government’s policy is to encourage the nationalised
industries to behave as far as possible as commercial enterprises, and this is
carried out through the financial framework, set by the Government, within
which the industries are expected to operate. This is designed also to integrate
the industries’ medium-term commercial aims with the requirements of
government policy on the management of the economy. The main elements of
the framework are: clear government objectives for the industries; regular
corporate plans and performance reviews; systematic monitoring; agreed
principles relating to investment appraisal and pricing; external financing
limits; and financial targets and performance aims.
To ensure that nationalised industry investment earns an adequate economic
return, there is a ‘required rate of return’ which investment programmes are
expected to achieve. The current rate is 5 per cent in real terms before tax.
Financial targets are set for individual nationalised industries to give them a
framework similar to those of private sector companies which need to earn
profits. They are supported by a series of performance aims, covering costs and
standards of service, which are considered particularly important for industries
with some monopoly power where financial targets would not automatically
impose pressures for operating efficiency. External financing limits, which
control the amount of finance (grants and borrowing) that a nationalised
industry can raise from external sources in any financial year, are an important
short-term operating control. They are set in the light of a nationalised
industry’s financial target and its expected performance and investment
requirements. Nationalised industries are planning to finance a greater
proportion of investment from internally generated funds.

External scrutiny of nationalised industry efficiency is conducted by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (see p 235), which carries out up to six
investigations each year at the instigation of ministers, and these investigations
are complemented on occasion by studies undertaken by management consul¬
tants. Nationalised industry matters are also considered by parliamentary
committees such as the Treasury and Civil Service Committee and the Public
Accounts Committee.
The Government believes that reform of the nationalised industries is essential
to economic recovery, and that the best way to improve performance in the long
term is to expose the industries to market forces, through privatisation and the
promotion of competition. Privatisation also provides a major opportunity for
the Government to pursue its policy of widening share ownership, encouraging
both employees and the general public to take a direct stake in British industry.
Businesses which have been privatised include British Aerospace, British
Telecom, Cable and Wireless, the National Freight Consortium, Jaguar,
Amersham International, Enterprise Oil, Britoil, Associated British Ports and
British Shipbuilders warship-building yards. Many other state enterprises have
also been sold and, altogether, 400,000 jobs have been transferred to the private
sector. Planned privatisations include British Airways, British Gas, the National
Bus Company, Rolls-Royce, the British Airports Authority and a number of
water supply authorities. To stimulate efficiency, the Government has relaxed
the statutory monopolies of a number of nationalised industries.
Expenditure on research and development supported by the Department of
Trade and Industry is aimed at improving the capability of firms to exploit
technological opportunities and encouraging firms to undertake innovative
projects which promise high returns. A growing proportion of expenditure is
going towards work carried out in industry, especially in areas such as micro¬
electronics, fibre optics and computer software; other work is done at research
associations and in government research establishments. The Department’s
research establishments are the National Physical Laboratory (responsible not
only for measurement standards, but also for research and development in
related fields of national importance, including the properties of industrially
important materials, and information technology), the National Engineering
Laboratory (research and development in mechanical engineering, including
manufacturing systems and robotics, materials applications, fluid power,
pumps, fans and heat exchangers, and structural analysis and testing), the
Warren Spring Laboratory (control engineering, materials handling, metal
extraction, mineral processing, waste materials processing and environmental
technology), and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (analytical services
mainly to central and local government, public institutions and international
organisations).
‘Support for Innovation' is the Department of Trade and Industry’s general
facility for providing selective financial support for research and development
projects leading to new products and processes and for longer-term applied
research projects. In 1985—86 the Department spent £440 million on scientific
and technological assistance. The Department is advised by a Technology
Requirements Board and a number of advisory committees of senior indus¬
trialists and academics on the overall allocation of its resources to particular
technologies and industrial sectors.
The Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development, whose mem¬
bership includes academics, industrialists and trade unionists engaged in all
aspects of research and development in a wide variety of industrial sectors, is a
source of independent advice to ministers collectively on applied research and

development in both the public and private sectors, on the linkage between this
research and scientific research supported by government departments, on the
development and application of technology, and on the role of Britain in
international collaboration in such activities. The Council has published a
number of reports on aspects of new technology. It is served by a secretariat in
the Cabinet Office.
The objective of the British Technology Group (BTG) is to promote the
development of new technology into commercial products, particularly where
the technology originates from public sector sources, such as universities,
polytechnics, research councils and government research establishments. It
offers to take responsibility for protecting and licensing inventions from these
sources, provides funds for development, seeks licensees and negotiates licence
agreements with industry. As part of its technology transfer role it can also offer
project finance to companies that want to develop new products and processes
based on new technology. Through its joint venture finance the BTG can provide
up to 50 per cent of the funds required and expects to recover its investment by
means of a percentage levy on sales of the resulting product or process. This
finance is available to companies of all sizes. The BTG is not a grant-giving body.
It seeks to make a return on its investments and approaches every transaction
on a commercial basis.
The BTG currently has a portfolio of 1,750 British patents and patent
applications, over 600 licensees in Britain and overseas, 360 development
projects at universities and other public sector institutions, and 230 projects
with industrial companies.
In cases where a particular technology requires the setting up of a new
company, the BTG can perform a catalytic role in launching start-up companies.
In 1985—86, the industry departments in Great Britain spent £76 million on
national selective assistance, £359 million on regional development grant and
£110 million on regional selective assistance.
The Department provides investment support for major projects which are
judged to have exceptional national benefits and which would not proceed
without assistance. The Department also operates schemes of selective assist¬
ance to support investment in microelectronics, fibre optics and optoelectronics
and advanced manufacturing technology.
Guarantees are provided for the repayment of loans and interest incurred in
the purchase of new ships and mobile offshore installations built in Britain.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years, in certain regions, of older industries, such as
coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles, and partly to the tendency of many newer
and expanding industries to develop elsewhere. Thus the traditional industrial
areas, mainly in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the north of England,
have experienced, for many years, higher unemployment rates than regions
such as the South East, and have suffered from net outward migration and
industrial dereliction. In order to help to restore the economies of the areas of
greatest need the Government has provided incentives to encourage industrial
development in designated ‘assisted areas’. Following a review of policy in Great
Britain (Northern Ireland is treated separately), the Government has reaffirmed
its commitment to maintain an effective regional industrial policy to ease the
process of change in areas which have been dependent on declining industries
and encourage the setting up of new businesses there. A new structure of

regional industrial incentives, more directly linked to job creation, and a revised
designation of the assisted areas, were introduced in 1984.
There are two categories of assisted areas: ‘development areas' and ‘inter¬
mediate areas', with the former being adjudged to have the greatest need for
assistance (see map, p231). Regional development grants are payable for
investment in qualifying activities in the development areas, either as a
proportion of capital expenditure limited by a cost-per-job ceiling or as an
amount for each new job created, whichever is the more advantageous to the
investor. Small firms are not, in general, subject to a cost-per-job ceiling. All
manufacturing industries and some service industries are eligible for regional
development grants. In addition, regional selective assistance may be payable to
manufacturing and certain service sector projects that create or safeguard
employment throughout the assisted areas.
The Government provides factories and workshops where the private sector is
unwilling to invest in them. Special grants are available towards the improve¬
ment of the infrastructure in the assisted areas and towards the clearance of
derelict land.
The Department of Trade and Industry takes the lead in the formulation of
regional industrial policy and administers the regional development grant and
regional selective assistance schemes in England. The Welsh and Scottish
Offices administer these schemes in their respective countries. Factories in the
assisted areas are provided, often in association with the private sector, by the
government-funded English Industrial Estates Corporation (known as English
Estates), and by the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.
The Industrial Development Board, formed in 1982 under the aegis of the
Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, offers a range of
incentives similar to those available in the assisted areas (in some cases at
higher rates). Incentives automatically available to manufacturing industry
include grants of up to 20 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, training
grants, grants for key workers moving to Northern Ireland and exemption from
local authority rates (local property taxes) for manufacturing premises. Manu¬
facturing and service industry projects which create jobs may be eligible for
grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, interest relief grants,
favourable rental terms for factories, and grants to assist with setting-up costs
and research and development costs. The Board can also provide equity and loan
capital for new and expanding businesses, assist the development of new
high-technology products and processes, and promote joint ventures with
overseas companies. Other incentives include corporation tax relief of up to 80
per cent for certain new projects; 30 per cent grants for approved energy
conservation projects; grants to attract and retain good management: and an
advisory service on production methods.
Government regional policies have been aimed at encouraging new industries in
order to offset the decline in traditional activities. Accordingly the Scottish and
Welsh Development Agencies promote industrial development in their respective
countries. They encourage investment by overseas companies, provide equity
and loan capital for industrial projects (which they are expected to do with a
maximum of private sector participation), provide government factories, and
have powers to assist small firms and undertake land reclamation.
The Development Commission is responsible for promoting the economic and
social development of rural England. It provides small factories and workshops
which are built and managed by English Estates, and administers a grant
scheme for the conversion of redundant buildings to industrial or commercial

premises. The Commission’s main agency, the Council for Small Industries in
Rural Areas, provides technical management and financial advice, training
facilities and loans to small businesses from 32 county offices. The Commission
also supports voluntary bodies in rural areas to encourage community activity
and self help and provides finance for small-scale rural housing and transport
schemes. Though its responsibility extends over the whole of rural England, the
Commission’s resources are concentrated in the areas of greatest need, which
are designated as rural development areas.
In Scotland and Wales similar services are provided generally through the
development agencies, but separate bodies cater for two particular rural areas.
In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board provides loans and
grants for viable projects in manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries and services,
makes available training grants and advice, and builds factories. The Develop¬
ment Board for Rural Wales (usually referred to as ‘Mid-Wales Development’)
provides factories, key worker housing and advice for small businesses. It has a
general responsibility to promote the economic and social well-being of
mid-Wales and a particular responsibility for the new town of Newtown, Powys.
Business and technical advisory services include consultancy grants for firms
employing up to 500 people which wish to improve the quality or design of their
products, their manufacturing organisation and techniques or to resolve
technical problems. Grants are also available to all manufacturing firms and in
some cases to service companies, towards the cost of feasibility studies by
consultants into the exploitation of biotechnology, microelectronics applica¬
tions, advanced manufacturing systems (computer-aided design and manufac¬
ture, robotics, flexible manufacturing systems or computer-aided production
management) and the use of integrated circuits.
The Department of Employment is responsible for the formation of policy
towards the small business sector. Together with the Small Business Division of
the Scottish Development Agency and the Business Development Unit of the
Welsh Development Agency, the Department provides advice and guidance on a
wide range of business problems affecting small firms (in manufacturing,
generally defined as those firms employing less than 200 people) and those
seeking to set up businesses. In Northern Ireland the Local Enterprise
Development Unit, established to promote the development of small industries,
provides grants, loans, help with obtaining premises and management advice to
new and expanding companies. Local enterprise agencies, independent of the
Government, also provide counselling and other services for small businesses.
The Government has been particularly concerned since the late 1970s to
encourage small firms; between 1980 and 1984 there were about 140,000 more
business starts than closures. It has introduced a framework of measures aimed
at reducing burdens and providing incentives for enterprise and risk-taking.
These have included a loan guarantee scheme, under which the Government
guarantees repayment of 70 per cent of medium-term loans made by participat¬
ing financial institutions; a business expansion scheme, under which tax reliefs
are available to private individuals investing in small businesses; and the
enterprise allowance scheme, which enables longer-term unemployed people to
claim an allowance while establishing a new business. A range of other tax
concessions has also been made for small firms. The development of new sources
of venture capital has been promoted and a number of private sector initiatives
have been made by the clearing banks and by groups of large firms and financial
institutions. Priority is being given to the provision of relevant and accessible
training for those setting up or running small businesses, together with
appropriate advisory services. Local Enterprise Agencies, partnerships between

firms and organisations in both the public and private sectors, which exist to
provide advice and training for small businesses and also provide small business
workshops, are being encouraged.
The Department of Trade and Industry's programme of export support is
directed by the British Overseas Trade Board, whose members are mainly
business people with practical knowledge of exporting. Liaison is maintained
with the extensive network of Foreign and Commonwealth Office commercial
staff overseas. Services provided include advice on individual export markets
and opportunities, assistance for exhibitors at overseas trade fairs and
specialist advice on tariffs, regulations, technical requirements and product
approval procedures.
Direct government support for the tourism industry is provided by five statutory
bodies. The British Tourist Authority (BTA) is responsible for the overseas
promotion of tourism to Great Britain. The English, Scottish and Wales Tourist
Boards, which promote tourism in their respective countries, encourage the
development and improvement of tourist accommodation and amenities, and
administer grants or loans for projects to provide or improve tourist amenities,
and interest relief grants. The Scottish Tourist Board, unlike its English and
Welsh counterparts, is also empowered to carry out its own overseas promo¬
tional activities in consultation with the BTA; these activities are intended to
supplement, rather than replace, the overseas promotional work undertaken by
the BTA. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) has a promotional role
similar to that of the other boards; the BTA carries out overseas promotional
activities on behalf of the NITB on an agency basis.
The BTA offers a trophy annually for the most outstanding tourist develop¬
ment for overseas visitors; in 1985 the trophy was won by the Wigan Pier
heritage and leisure centre.
The European Community seeks to increase the degree of convergence between
the economies of member states and to ensure a more balanced distribution of
economic activities within the Community. The principal responsibility for
helping depressed areas remains with national authorities but the Community
may complement schemes through aid from a number of sources.
The European Regional Development Fund was established in 1975. Its purpose
is to contribute to the correction of the main regional imbalances within the
Community by participating in the development and structural adjustment of
regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining
industrial regions. The Fund’s resources are allocated between member states
on the basis of quota ranges; Britain has the third largest quota range. By
December 1985 about £1,924 million had been allocated to Britain, mainly for
the assisted areas (see p 230) and Northern Ireland, since 1975. In addition,
about £132 million has been allocated to Britain for specific programmes
running over several years to improve the environment and encourage the
development of employment in certain steel, shipbuilding and textile closure
areas and in the border regions of Northern Ireland.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a self-governing institution set up by
the Treaty of Rome with member states of the European Community subscrib¬
ing to its capital. The Bank's aims are to help to stimulate development in
less-favoured regions, to modernise or convert industries, to help to create new
activities and to offset structural difficulties affecting certain sectors. The EIB
also serves projects of common interest to several member states or the

Community as a whole. It has loaned about £4,200 million since 1973 for
projects in Britain, mostly for public works such as the Sullom Voe oil terminal,
and manufacturing projects in the assisted areas.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) provides loans and grants to
encourage rational distribution of production and a high level of productivity in
the coal and steel industries while safeguarding employment and avoiding
unfair competition. Areas eligible for aid are coal industry projects, conversion
schemes, construction of housing for workers, allowances for redeployed
workers and research, including research of a social or medical nature.
Exchange risk cover may be provided by the Government on certain ECSC loans
for projects qualifying for regional selective assistance. The British borrower
takes on only a sterling liability.
A major feature of the Government's economic policy is the stimulation of
competition and the control of practices which are restrictive or anti¬
competitive. Linked to this policy is the encouragement of fair trading, with the
particular aim of helping consumers and safeguarding their rights. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Corporate and Consumer Affairs,
who is answerable to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industxy, has special
responsibilities for competition policy and consumer affairs (although certain
matters, such as safety of foodstuffs and road vehicles, are the concern of other
departments). The Office of Fair Trading, a government agency headed by the
Director General of Fair Trading, has various executive responsibilities relating
to competition policy and consumer protection.
Competition policy is supported by machinery for scrutinising and regulating
monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive practices and restrictive trade practices,
and by powers to regulate any structural changes or anti-competitive practices
which operate against the public interest. The Director General of Fair Trading
administers the Fair Trading Act 1973, which deals with monopolies and
mergers, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which deals with restrictive
trading agreements, the Resale Prices Act 1976, which deals with minimum
resale price maintenance, and the Competition Act 1980, which deals with
anti-competitive practices.
The Government is working to increase competition in professional services,
through relaxation of unjustifiable restrictive practices including restrictions on
fee sales and on advertising. Measures are being taken to improve competition
in conveyancing. The opticians' monopoly on the dispensing of spectacles was
ended in 1984, and certain professional groups (for example, accountants,
solicitors and veterinary surgeons) have eased restrictions on advertising by
their members. Building societies are to be allowed to offer a greater range of
services than they are able to do at present, which will bring more competition to
the fields of financial services and estate agency. Financial services generally are
to be subject to a greater degree of regulation in the interests of investor
protection, and there will be special provision for consideration of the
implications for competition policy by the Director General.
The Government believes that most mergers have a market rationale’ and in
most cases does not wish to intervene. However, it recognises the need to control
companies with excessive market shares.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Director General of Fair
Trading can refer monopolies for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
236
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commission, an independent body whose members are drawn from a variety of
backgrounds, including lawyers, economists, industrialists and trade union¬
ists. The legislation defines a monopoly as a situation where at least a quarter of
a particular kind of goods or service is supplied by or to a single person, or by two
or more people acting in a way which prevents, restricts, or distorts competition.
Local monopolies can also be referred to the Commission, and the Secretary of
State can refer public sector industries. If the Commission finds that a
monopoly operates against the public interest, the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry has powers to take action to remedy or prevent the harm which the
Commission considers may exist. Alternatively the Director General may be
asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the adverse effects identified by the
Commission.
Proposals for a merger (defined as occurring when two or more enterprises are
brought under common ownership or control) may be referred to the Commis¬
sion by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, taking account of advice
from the Director General, if the merger would result in or intensify a monopoly
or if the total value of gross assets to be taken over would exceed £30 million. If
the Commission finds that a merger or proposed merger may be expected to
operate against the public interest, the Secretary of State can prevent it from
taking place or obtain undertakings to remedy the adverse effects identified; or,
if it has already taken place, he can require it to be reversed. There are special
provisions for newspaper mergers.
In 1984, following a review of its mergers policy, the Government said that it
would continue to make reference decisions primarily on competition grounds:
and, in evaluating the competitive situation, it would have regard to the
international context—to the extent of competition in the domestic market from
overseas sources and to the competitive position of British firms in overseas
markets.

Restrictive
Trade
Practices
Subject to limited exemptions, the Director General can investigate any
business practice (whether in the public or private sectors) which may restrict,
distort or prevent competition in the production, supply or acquisition of goods
or services in Britain. If the Director General concludes that a practice is
anti-competitive he may either accept an undertaking from the business
responsible for the practice or, in default of such an undertaking, refer the
matter to the Commission to establish whether it operates against the public
interest. On an adverse finding by the Commission, the Secretary of State has
powers to take remedial action.
The Competition Act empowers the Secretary of State to refer to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission any questions on the efficiency and costs of, the
service provided by, or the possible abuse of a monopoly situation by, various
bodies in the public sector. It is the Government's intention that at least one
major examination of each industry should take place every four years.
Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 restrictive trading agreements
have to be registered with the Director General of Fair Trading. Broadly, an
agreement is registrable if two or more parties to it, engaged in business in
Britain in the supply of goods or services, accept some limitation on their
freedom to make their own decisions about matters such as prices or conditions
of sale. Failure to register an agreement means that the restrictions are void and
the parties are liable to legal proceedings. Having placed an agreement on the
register, the Director General has the duty of referring it to the Restrictive
Practices Court and the Court must declare the restrictions in it contrary to the
FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
237
public interest unless the parties can satisfy the Court by reference to criteria
laid down in the Act that this is not the case. Restrictions declared contrary to
the public interest are void and the Court can order the parties not to give effect
to them or make any similar agreement. In practice, however, many agreements
do not need to be referred to the Court because, for example, the parties choose
to give up the restrictions rather than go to court, or the Secretary of State
accepts the Director General s advice that the restrictions are not significant
enough to warrant reference to the Court.
European
Community
Consumer
Protection
The objective ol the European Community's competition policy is to ensure that
there is free and fair competition in trade between member states and that the
government trade barriers dismantled by the Treaty of Rome are not replaced by
private barriers which fragment the common market. The competition rules are
set out in the Treaty of Rome. These are directly applicable in the law of member
states. In most areas of economic activity their enforcement is the responsibility
of the European Commission, which has powers to investigate and terminate
alleged infringements and to impose fines.
The Treaty prohibits agreements or concerted practices which are likely to
affect trade between member states and have as their object, or effect, the
prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.
Agreements meeting specified criteria may be exempted from this prohibition
and, subject to particular conditions and safeguards, certain categories of
agreement are exempted completely: these include agreements in respect of
exclusive distribution and purchasing, patent licensing, research and develop¬
ment, and motor vehicle distribution and servicing. The Treaty also prohibits
any abuse of a dominant position within the common market or a substantial
part of it to the extent that it affects trade between member states.
In addition to laws designed to benefit customers by providing effective
competition, there is a body of legislation whose purpose is to ensure that
consumers are adequately protected.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs, for
action to deal with trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’ interests
and with persistent offenders under existing law, and for the negotiation of
self-regulatory codes of practice to raise trading standards. The Director General
is also responsible for the operation of legislation which regulates consumer
credit and hire business and estate agency work.
The consumer s interests with regard to the purity of foods, the description
an performance of goods and services and pricing information are safeguarded
by the Food Act 1984, the Medicines Act 1968, the Trade Descriptions Acts 1968
and 1972, the Prices Act 1974, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Sale of
Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. The marking
and accuracy of quantities are regulated by the Weights and Measures Act 1985
The Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971 and the Consumer Safety Act
1978 empower the Government to control the supply of most goods in the
interests of safety. A White Paper proposing major changes in the law to prevent
unsafe products being marketed was published in 1984 and legislative
proposals to implement some of these measures received royal assent in July
1986. The Government intends to introduce legislation implementing the
indications pr0p°Sals and to clarify the la^s prohibiting misleading price
Legislative proposals to offer greater protection to investors by establishing a
new regulatory framework for the financial services sector have been put before

Consumer

LAW
Advice and information on consumer matters is provided to the general public at
local level by the trading standards or consumer protection departments of local
authorities and in some areas by specialist Consumer Advice Centres. Citizens
Advice Bureaux also provide advice to the public on consumer matters.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which receives government finance, ensures
that the consumer's view is made known to those in government and industry
whose decisions affect the consumer’s interest. In Northern Ireland the General
Consumer Council for Northern Ireland (which became fully operational in April
1985) has wide-ranging responsibilities in the field of consumer protection and
consumer affairs in general.
Consumer councils for the energy, rail and other nationalised industries and
the privatised gas industry investigate questions of concern to the consumer,
while some trade associations in industry and commerce have established codes
of practice. In addition, several private organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association, funded by the subscrip¬
tions of its membership of over 820,000. The Association conducts an extensive
programme of comparative testing of goods and investigation of services; its
views and test reports are published in its monthly magazines and other
publications. The Association provides a legal advice service on subscription.
Local consumer groups, many belonging to a national federation, also promote
consumers’ interests and provide information and advice.
The European Community’s consumer programme covers a number of
important topics, such as health and safety, protection of the consumer’s
economic interests when purchasing goods and services, promotion of con¬
sumer education and strengthening the representation of consumers. A
directive on liability for defective products was adopted in 1985 and must be
implemented in Britain by 1988. The views of British consumer organisations
are represented by the Consumers in the European Community Group (UK).
The formation and conduct of companies is regulated by the Companies Act
1985. Incorporation' involves registering with the Registrar of Companies in
Cardiff, Edinburgh or Belfast, depending on whether a company's registered
office is in England or Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The Act also deals
with capital structure, the rights and duties of directors and members, and the
preparation and filing of accounts. Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies. Each company is a legal entity distinct from its members,
who are not as such liable for its debts. The liability of members of a limited
company is limited to contributing an amount related to their shareholding. In
unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships or partnerships, by
contrast, individuals are personally liable for any business debts (except where a
member of a partnership is a limited liability company).
Companies may be either public or private. A company must satisfy three
conditions before it can be a public limited company (pic): it must be limited by
shares and have a share capital; it must state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company; and it must meet specified minimum
capital requirements. All other registered companies are, by definition, private
companies and, as such, prohibited from offering their shares to the public.
The consolidation of the Companies Acts 1948-83 has been completed and
came into force in July 1985; it restates existing law in a clearer and more
convenient form, and makes application and interpretation easier for those
concerned with the regulation of company affairs. The consolidation resulted
in the Companies Act 1985 and three smaller Acts: the Business Names Act
1985, which regulates the names under which people may carry on business
in Great Britain; the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985, which

AND

restates the law on insider dealing; and the Companies Consolidation (Con¬
sequential Provisions) Act 1985, which deals with the technical aspects of the
consolidation.
The Insolvency Act 1985 affects both corporate and individual insolvency
proceedings. It introduced for England, Wales and Scotland a licensing
procedure to ensure the professional competence, integrity and independence of
people who act as trustees of bankrupt individuals, or as liquidators, receivers
or administrators of bankrupt companies. The bankruptcy legislation has been
modernised and simplified. It applies only to England and Wales and will come
into force in December 1986; the position of Scotland is covered by separate
legislation which came into force in April 1986. The Act also amended and
supplemented the legislation relating to the winding-up of limited companies
and the appointment of receivers in England, Wales and Scotland. A new
framework for dealing with directors of limited companies who are demon¬
strably unfit to act as such came into operation in April 1986: they can be
disqualified from office and, in some cases, held personally liable for a
company’s debts. The Act also introduced procedures to enable individual and
corporate debtors to reach agreements with their creditors without the necessity
for formal bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. These procedures, applying to
England, Wales and Scotland, will come into effect in December 1986.
There is a substantial body of legislation designed to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions, new industrial designs and trade marks. These
matters are administered by the Patent Office, which includes the Design
Registry and the Trade Marks Registry. The Patent Office is a division of the
Department of Trade and Industry. Protection is also available under the
European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty, and benefits
may be claimed in other countries by virtue of the International Convention for
the Protection of Industrial Property. The Government has reviewed the law on
copyright and related matters, with particular attention to the problems raised
by private tape recordings of sound and video copyright works, the application of
copyright to industrial designs, and the use of photocopying. In April 1986 it
published a White Paper setting out legislative and other proposals covering the
whole field of copyright and other aspects of intellectual property, including the
future operation of the Patent Office. Legislation to extend copyright protection
to owners of computer software was passed in July 1985. The penalties for
trading in pirate sound and film recordings (including video) were greatly
increased in 1983.
The Government is concerned to encourage innovation by providing a more
adequate legal and administrative system for the protection of the ownership of
ideas by means of patents, registered designs, trade marks and copyright, and to
improve awareness of the value of these intellectual property rights and of their
accessibility and usage, particularly by individuals and small businesses.
Proposals to facilitate the computerisation of the Patent Office s registers and to
extend the law on trade marks to include services have been put before
Parliament.
12 Manufacturing
and Service
Industries
The manufacturing and service industries, together with construction, account
for about 88 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), the remainder being
accounted for by energy production and agriculture. Since 1950, GDP has more
than doubled in real terms and both manufacturing and services have
contributed to this growth. As in other developed economies, rising living
standards have led to a faster growth of demand for services than for
manufactures, so that the proportion of GDP accounted for by services has
increased steadily. About 26 per cent of the employed labour force was engaged
in manufacturing in 1985 (compared with about 40 per cent in 1950) and
around 67 per cent of visible exports consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. In the same year, 65 per cent of the employed labour force
was engaged in service industries, and international trade in services produced
a surplus on current account of £5,800 million. Among the traded services
covered in this chapter, business services and tourism show the greatest
growth. Financial services, which have also shown significant growth, are not
included in this chapter, nor are large non-traded service sectors such as
education, health, and public administration and defence.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output as a whole fell after 1973, following the rise in
international oil prices, but grew again gradually between 1975 and 1979.
Following further rises in energy costs, manufacturing output declined signifi¬
cantly between 1979 and 1981 in almost all of the industrialised market
economies. Additional factors depressing output in Britain were high domestic
interest rates and, for exporters, a rise in the exchange value of sterling which
raised the prices of British goods in overseas markets and lowered the price of
foreign goods in Britain. Output remained low in 1982, but rose by 2-9 per cent
in 1983, by 3-9 per cent in 1984 and by 3 0 per cent in 1985.
The figures in Table 17 show the relative size of the sectors of manufacturing
and their growth rates.
The recovery has been most notable in the chemicals and electrical and
instrument engineering sectors, which are also the sectors which have shown
the highest growth over the last decade. Extensive reorganisation, re-equipment
and modernisation in long-established industries such as steel manufacture,
vehicle-building and shipbuilding have greatly increased productivity. Utilisa¬
tion of advanced technology, especially microelectronics, is steadily increasing
in all sectors. A major stimulus has been provided by the various needs of the
offshore oil and gas industries.
242
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Since manufacturing industry lies mainly in the private sector, investment in
manufacturing tends to be determined by market considerations and to reflect
expectations of profitability. There are discernible cycles in the level of
investment: 1983 saw the beginning of an upturn in the latest trough. Total
direct investment in 1985 was £7,950 million at current prices, comprising
£6,394 million on plant and machinery, £994 million on new building and £562
million on vehicles. In addition, assets worth an estimated £1,599 million were
purchased by financial companies to lease to manufacturers.
Most manufacturing is carried out by private enterprise. Though the greater
parts of the iron and steel and shipbuilding industries are in public ownership,
the Government is reducing the extent of state ownership of industry. Table 18
shows the size distribution of manufacturing establishments. About 55 per cent
of the largest establishments were in engineering and metals and vehicle
manufacturing. Within the private sector, the 100 largest* companies accounted
for 34 per cent of manufacturing employment in 1983. (A company may consist
of one or more establishments.)
The largest manufacturing companies (by £ million turnover in the latest
financial year) are BAT Industries (14,426), Imperial Chemical Industries
(9,909), Unilever (5,859), General Electric Company (4,800), Imperial Group
(4,593), Ford Motor Company (3,752), BL (3,402), Gallaher (2,839) and
Associated British Foods (2,776).

Iron and Steel
Products
Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, and Britain is the worlds tenth largest steel-producing nation (by
volume). The British Steel Corporation (BSC), formed as a public corporation in
1967, has accounted in recent years for 82 to 85 per cent of Britain’s crude steel
production by volume and is the world’s fourth largest steel company. BSC
invested heavily in modernising its production capacity in the 1960s and 1970s.
The basic oxygen process is now used for bulk steel production with the electric
arc process for more specialised tasks; the traditional open-hearth process
isappeared in 1980. Because of a world-wide over-supply of steel, BSC has had
to accelerate the closure of its older steelworks and reduce capacity at other
works. Rationalisation of the industry has involved some transfers of assets
between BSC and the private sector and the closure in both sectors of plants
which cannot be made profitable. Productivity doubled between 1981 and 1985
and is now among the best in the world.
British producers’ deliveries of finished steel were 12-9 million tonnes in
1985, of which 69 per cent was used by home industry, the remainder being
directly exported. The private sector is particularly strong in the manufacture of
more specialised steels and of finished products for the engineering industry.
e industry is concentrated in Wales, northern England and Scotland As a
member of the European Coal and Steel Community, Britain co-operates with
he other members in efforts to rationalise the structure and improve the
profitability of the steel industry throughout the Community. Britain welcomed
the ending of all direct government subsidy to the steel industries of member
countries at the beginning of 1986, but remains concerned about the effects of
continuing indirect subsidy, particularly on energy, transport and labour costs
in some countries.

Britain has one of the largest non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating
industries in Europe. Output in 1985 included: aluminium (293,000 tonnes of
primary metal and 102,000 tonnes of secondary metal); refined copper (64,000
tonnes of primary metal and 62,000 tonnes of secondary metal); refined lead
(148,000 tonnes of primary metal and 160,000 tonnes of secondary metal); and
zinc (74,000 tonnes of slab metal). Primary metal production relies mainly on
imported ores, concentrates and partially refined metal.
Britain is also a major producer of specialised alloys for high technology
requirements in the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and nuclear and other
fuel industries. Titanium and titanium alloys are produced and used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea oil production.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the midlands. Europe's largest nickel
refinery and only titanium granule plant are situated in Wales, near Swansea,
West Glamorgan, and in Deeside respectively. There is a zinc smelter of some
100,000 tonnes capacity at Avonmouth. Two large-scale aluminium smelters in
Lynemouth, Northumberland, and Anglesey, Gwynedd, provide 75 per cent of
Britain's requirements for primary aluminium. A wide range of semi¬
manufactures is produced in copper, lead, zinc and aluminium and their alloys,
and, particularly in aluminium and copper, firms are engaged in smelting,
casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing; advanced techniques
of powder metallurgy and pressure die-casting are also employed, which help to
conserve energy and materials. In recent years considerable progress has been
made in the development of ‘superplastic' alloys, which are more ductile and
elastic than conventional alloys. Aluminium lithium, a new alloy which is up to
20 per cent lighter than traditional materials, is currently being developed by a
British company with plans to use it in aircraft construction.
Exports of aluminium and aluminium alloys reached £400 million in 1985
while exports in the same year of copper, brass and other copper alloys reached
£353 million. Exports of silver, platinum and other precious metals totalled over
£439 million in 1985. The major export markets for the whole industry are the
United States and the rest of the European Community.
The manufacture of most building materials is now based on highly mechanised
systems. Five major companies supply about 72 per cent of total brick deliveries.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. This was invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824. Three firms dominate the industry, the largest being Blue Circle
Industries.
Glass-reinforced cement composites were invented in Britain in the mid-
1970s and are manufactured under licence in over 40 other countries.
The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. (Britain is the world's largest exporter of china clay, which
was the country's largest mineral export until the discovery of North Sea oil.)
There has been considerable re-equipment in the industry; kilns fired by gas or
electricity have replaced all the coal-fired kilns, and new decorating techniques
and automatic and semi-automatic machinery, such as automatic glazing
machines, have been introduced. More recently there has been investment in
new technology such as fast-firing and once-firing kilns. Domestic pottery,
including china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for 60 per cent of the
industry's output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and
electrical ware, and such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stone¬
ware, porous ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production of tableware is
concentrated in two major groups, Wedgwood and Royal Doulton. Britain is the
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
245
world’s principal manufacturer of fine bone china, much of which is exported;
famous makes include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton,
Minton, Aynsley, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Research is being conducted into ceramics for use in housebuilding and diesel
and jet engines. Important industrial ceramics invented in Britain include
silicon carbides developed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and
sialons developed at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Refractory goods include heat-resisting materials such as magnesite, silica
and high-alumina bricks, crucibles, kiln linings and radiants for gas and
electric fires.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the biggest in the world and all types of glass
product are made. Glass containers form the largest part of the industry;
another major section is devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various
forms, chiefly by the float glass process developed in Britain by Pilkington
Brothers and licensed to glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkingtons have
also developed an energy-saving window glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. There is also a craft sector producing high-quality
handmade lead crystal glass.

The chemicals industry is one of the most successful industries in Britain as
well as being its fifth largest industrial sector, accounting for about 10 per cent
of manufacturing net output. It produces a complete range of products
including basic industrial chemicals (inorganic chemicals, basic organic
chemicals, plastics, fertilisers and other products), pharmaceuticals, soap,
toiletries and explosives. The industry is also the third largest in Europe and the
fifth largest in the Western world. Western Europe is the major export market,
and organic chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals account for more than 50
per cent of chemical exports by value. The areas of highest growth between 1985
and 1986 were formulated pesticides, synthetic resins and plastics, dyestuffs
and pigments, organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals.
The largest British chemicals group, Imperial Chemical Industries, is the fifth
largest chemicals company in the world, accounting for around 25 per cent of
production in Britain. Exports account for 50 per cent of its production. The
industry is represented by the Chemical Industries Association.
Basic Industrial A high proportion of inorganic chemicals production consists of relatively
Chemicals simple bulk chemicals, such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-metallic
oxides, serving as basic materials for industry. The most important products in

ticals
the organic chemicals range (by weight) are ethylene (1,447,000 tonnes
produced in 1985), propylene (973,000 tonnes) and benzene (835,000 tonnes).
Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general chemicals
formulated for specific uses.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Over 30 per cent of production is exported. Expansion in recent years
has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs), poly¬
vinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial purposes
and consumer goods), polystyrene (used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods) and polypropylene (which can be fabricated as mouldings,
films and fibres). A new group of plastics materials reinforced with carbon fibres
is also in commercial production; they have up to three times the strength but
are only 20 per cent of the weight of steel, and are being increasingly used in
aircraft and vehicle manufacture. Styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene rubbers
used for tyres, high-styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile
rubbers for use where oil resistance is required are also in large-scale
production, together with neoprene rubber.
British companies also produce large quantities of coextruded oriented
polypropylene which is used in packaging food and other consumer products
and which is increasingly replacing cellulose films on grounds of versatility and
cost. ICI is among the world’s top three producers of polyethylene terephthalate,
a new form of polyester used to produce plastic bottles.
The industry produces a wide range of decorative and industrial paints and
varnishes. Specialised products include new ranges of synthetic resins and
pigments, powder coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints and paints
needing only one top coat. Two significant recent innovations have been solid
emulsion paint and a temporary water-based finish for vehicle bodies and road
markings, which can be removed easily by chemical treatment. The industry has
set a timetable for eliminating lead as a drier in paints and is conducting
research to find effective replacements.
Notable recent British discoveries and developments include pyrethroid insecti¬
cides, Id’s diquat and paraquat herbicides, and systemic fungicides and
aphicides. The development of chemical fertilisers also owes much to the pioneer
work of British scientists. Manufacture of chemical fertilisers, particularly
ammonium nitrate, is dominated by a few large firms producing almost entirely
for the domestic market. A substantial proportion of world research and
development in agrochemicals is conducted in Britain.
British scientists have played a major part in the development of essential drugs
and medicinal products, and about 12 per cent of the world’s research in
pharmaceuticals takes place in Britain. Britain is the world’s fourth largest
exporter of pharmaceutical products. Among the more recent major develop¬
ments pioneered in Britain have been: the introduction of new semi-synthetic
penicillins; the development of salbutamol, sodium cromoglycate and inhaled
beclomethasone dipropionate, which have revolutionised the treatment of
asthma; ibuprofen, an important advance in the treatment of arthritis;
cimetidine and ranitidine, which have profoundly affected the treatment of
peptic ulceration; humulin, a synthetic human insulin; and beta-blockers, used
in the treatment of heart disease. Britain is among the world leaders in the
production of antibiotics by fermentation.

Research Council, is a leader in the commercial production of monoclonal
antibodies, which are used as raw materials for other products and in the
purification of alpha-interferon and blood-typing products. The company is also
working on a range of other products such as calcitonin, which maybe useful in
treating osteoporosis (brittle bones) and macrophage activating factor, which
enhances the activity of the body’s immune system. A range of immuno-
radiometric assays for specific biochemicals is also under development in
Britain.
Britain is foremost among the world’s developers of molecular graphics, a
computer-aided technique for studying the structure of complicated organic
molecules on a visual display unit, eliminating the need for many physical tests
of drugs.
The industry is made up of British and many international companies which
often have manufacturing facilities in Britain. There are large companies in the
sector, sometimes with interests in the pharmaceutical, soap or detergent
industries, and also a number of small independent companies. Exports of the
industry’s products in 1985 were £340 million, compared with imports of less
than £200 million. The home market amounted to about £1,150 million at
manufacturers’ prices.
Many specialised chemical products are manufactured, including dyestuffs,
formulated adhesives and sealants, chemically treated oils and fats, essential
oils and flavouring materials, explosives, industrial gases, products for the
treatment of leather and textiles, adhesive film, cloth and foil, and surfactants
(surface-active agents) for many purposes. There is also major production of
soaps and detergents. Work is progressing on the use of epoxy and anaerobic
adhesives and cyanoacrylates in engineering as replacements for spot-welding
and riveting, especially in the motor industry.
Britain played a major role in the early development of man-made fibres and
continues to be an important producer of these fibres, mainly through a small
number of large companies. The main types of fibre are still those first
developed—regenerated cellulosic fibres such as viscose and the major synthetic
fibres such as nylon polyamide, polyester (a British invention) and acrylics.
Extensive research continues to produce a wide variety of innovative products
with characteristics designed to meet market needs, such as anti-static and
flame-retardant fibres. Polyolefins (polypropylene and polyethylene) find signifi¬
cant use in carpets, carpet backing and other household and industrial textiles.
More specialist products include the aramids (with very high thermal stability
and strength), elastanes (giving very high stretch and recovery), melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or weaving) and carbon fibres (originally
developed for the aerospace industry but now finding numerous wider
applications).
The mechanical engineering sector comprises industries manufacturing all
types of non-electrical machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechani¬
cal handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. Since
much of the production of the industry is of capital equipment, it suffered
particularly during the recession which began in 1979. Output dropped
substantially between 1979 and 1981 and remained at about the same level until
1984 when there was a recovery of output in some sectors of the industry. This
recovery strengthened in 1985 when growth of output in mechanical engineer¬
ing as a whole was 6 per cent, with rises of 22 per cent in printing machinery,
20 per cent in machine tools, 18 per cent in fork-lift and other industrial trucks.

13 per cent in steelwork and chemical industry machinery, 11 per cent in
construction equipment and 10 per cent in mining machinery. Over 40 per cent
of the industry's sales are exported, and exports in 1985 amounted to 11 per
cent of all visible exports.
The industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including
process) plant and steelwork. Of particular importance are fabricated products
such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and
oil-refining (process) plant, steam-raising boilers (including those of high
capacity for power stations), nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment
plant and fabricated steelwork for bridges, buildings and industrial installa¬
tions. The industrial plant industry comprises both equipment manufacturers
and contractors responsible for the design, engineering, construction and
commissioning of complete plants for process industries. Equipment for the
chemicals and related industries, such as processing, bottling and packaging
machines as well as mixing equipment and furnaces, ovens and kilns, is also
produced.
Britain is the Western world’s largest producer of agricultural tractors, which
make up two-thirds of the country’s total output of agricultural equipment.
There was a substantial downturn in the world tractor market between 1976
and 1983 which resulted in a fall in production of over 50 per cent in Britain
over this period. Output grew by 30 per cent in 1984, but fell by 14-5 per cent in
1985 to 87,857 units. The industry also produces a wide range of other general
and specialised agricultural equipment such as fruit, vegetable and root
harvesters. Britain’s total output of agricultural machinery and tractors in 1985
was £900 million, of which 65 per cent was exported, with a trade surplus of
£174 million.
The major domestic exhibitions for the industry’s products are the Royal
Smithfield Show and the Royal International Agricultural Show. The former is
held in London in December, the latter in July at the National Agricultural
Centre, near Coventry, which also provides regular demonstrations of technical
developments in agriculture. Much of the new machinery is designed for use in a
variety of conditions to meet the needs of overseas farmers, and since 1984 the

Royal International Agricultural Show has had a specialised tropical machinery
centre, where demonstrations of such machinery are given.
Britain produces a very wide range of machine tools. Almost all are purchased by
the engineering, vehicles and metal goods industries. As these sectors were
among those most affected by the recession in world manufacturing, production
of machine tools contracted between 1980 and 1983. However, new orders
increased substantially in 1984 and 1985.
The most commonly used metal-cutting machine tools are milling, grinding
and turning machines. The manufacture of computerised numerically con¬
trolled machine tools and the adoption of flexible manufacturing systems are
becoming increasingly important. The latter development has contributed to the
doubling of the number of robots installed in Britain since 1983. The United
States was again the largest export market for the industry in 1985 (£68-4
million). The next were the Federal Republic of Germany (£25 -4 million), Canada
(£14-7 million) and France (£13-3 million). The Machine Tool Trades Associa¬
tion represents most of the industry and is responsible for an international
exhibition held in Britain every four years, the next in 1988.
British inventions have remained the foundation of many textile processes in
use internationally and progress has been made in applying automated
techniques (including the use of microelectronics) in the industry. In 1985,
some 66 per cent of the industry’s total sales were to export markets. Recent
innovations in Britain include computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed computer-controlled knitting
machines, and electronic jacquard attachments for weaving looms.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment,
pile-drivers, and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of mining
machinery and equipment are substantial, while exports of construction
equipment amounted to £584 million in 1985 (80 per cent of output). The
privately owned company J. C. Bamford is the world’s second largest manufac¬
turer of backhoe loaders. It exports 60 per cent of its output and has remained
profitable in a market in which world demand fell by over 30 per cent between
1980 and 1984.
The British mining equipment industry is very strong, especially in the
production of shearing equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying equip¬
ment, flameproof transformers, switchgear and subsurface transport control
systems. About 85 per cent of British coal is mined using the longwall method,
which was developed in Britain. British manufacturers are the leaders in the
production of equipment for this type of mining. Exports of coal-mining
equipment in 1985 were £213 million.
Mechanical handling equipment is used not only for construction and related
activities but throughout industry generally. It extends from individual units
and accessories to complete operating systems, the main products being cranes
and transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists, powered indus¬
trial trucks and air bridges. Electronically controlled and completely automatic
handling systems are also produced.
Britain is also an important producer of other machinery such as industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and pneumatic and hydraulic
equipment.
Metal Products The castings industry plays an important role in meeting the needs of
manufacturers for essential components for products sold both in Britain and

abroad. Its main customers are the vehicle, mechanical engineering, and
building and construction industries. The larger mechanised foundries are
dominant, but many smaller craft foundries meet needs for specialised and
low-volume castings. Output (by volume) has been falling and the industry has
been progressively changing. While some foundries have been closing, many
others have been investing in new melting equipment, moulding equipment and
processes, and process and quality control equipment, both to meet demands
for castings of higher quality and strength and to improve working and
environmental conditions. A process patented in 1985 by a new British
company enables the production of perfect aluminium-casting dies in a single
semi-skilled operation, rather than the complex skilled operation necessary at
present, and promises to reduce greatly the cost of such dies.
This industry produces a wide range of goods which need an exceptional degree
of precision in their manufacture. Non-electrical measuring equipment forms
an important part of output. Other sectors of the industry include photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic equipment: watches, clocks and time
recorders; and medical and surgical instruments and appliances. Important
advances have been made in the application of recent developments in
mechanical and electronic engineering to production and quality control.

This group of industries suffered much less than other manufacturing
industries as a result of the world-wide recession of the early 1980s. Output fell
slightly from 1980 to 1981, but began to recover in 1982 and has grown steadily
since then. The outstanding sector has been the electronic data-processing
equipment sector, whose output nearly doubled between 1983 and 1985.
Britain produces a wide range of both capital and consumer electrical and
electronic goods. Advances in microelectronics have meant that the borderlines
between office machinery, data-processing equipment, telecommunications

equipment and consumer electronic equipment are becoming ever harder to
define. Britain is in the forefront of these developments, having originated many
of the breakthroughs in the area.
The computer sector, which has grown strongly over the past five years,
produces an extensive range of computer systems, central processors and
peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data-processing and
scientific work to mini- and microcomputers for use in control and automation
systems and for home, educational and office use. The number of innovative
companies in the sector, both in hardware and software, is very large. There are
about 300 such companies of all sizes in Silicon Glen’ in Scotland and a similar
number of mainly small firms in the Cambridge area.
Companies are constantly developing applications for new technology in the
office. In 1984, a major British computer manufacturer, ICL, introduced a
product known as the ‘One-per-desk’ which combines a personal computer,
business software and an advanced push-button telephone in one unit. The
company claims a world lead in this type of product. Major new mainframe
computers, the Series 39 range, were introduced in 1985.
The office machinery industry produces a wide range of equipment including
microfilm readers/printers, duplicators and rapid high-volume photocopiers.
British companies are strongly involved in the development of electronic
revenue control equipment, including electronic funds transfer and point of sale
equipment. The first large-scale trial of cashless shopping in Britain began in
Northampton in October 1985, using equipment manufactured by ICL. The
scheme involves over 100 retailers. Recent export orders include one for
integrated store systems for a group of 139 retail stores across the United States.
The stores will have point of sale terminals, information displays, printers and
mini-computers and will be linked by a national network, giving management
instant access to information on the whole business. British-made computer¬
ised ticketing equipment is being installed throughout British Rail's network;
this is the world's largest order to date for revenue control equipment.
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques is
increasing as new switching systems are introduced. The main products are
switching and transmission equipment, telephones and terminals for telex,
facsimile and teletex. British Telecom (BT) is the main customer for network
equipment and carries out research and development work in co-operation with
suppliers. Mercury Communication has been licensed to compete with BT in the
provision of network services, while the market for terminals and telephones has
been fully liberalised. Innovative work is being particularly stimulated by the
expansion of cable television and the growth in value added network services.
In 1984, two cellular radio networks began operation. These provide
sophisticated telephone services on portable telephones, and have been very
successful. A large number of British companies are engaged in producing
equipment for use with these networks.
One important sector of the industry produces transmission equipment and
cables for telecommunications networks and other purposes: its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a wide variety of materials.
The feasibility of using optical fibres (hair-thin strands of glass) in communica¬
tions was first demonstrated in Britain in 1966: they have a much higher
capacity and better durability and efficiency than copper cables. Britain now has
an advanced production capacity in this field. Well over half of the world’s
underseas communications cables have been made and laid by one British

company, STC. Hitherto these have been copper cables, but the company is
currently participating in laying the first optical fibre cable between Britain and
the United States.
Another expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufac¬
ture of radio communications equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
equipment, public broadcasting equipment and other capital goods. British
equipment is used extensively overseas, for defence, aviation, shipping, health
and educational purposes.
This sector produces a range of electrical and electronic measurement and test
equipment as well as analytical instruments. Production of process control
equipment is a large and expanding area along with the manufacture of
numerical control and indication equipment for use in machine tools.
British companies are among the leaders in several types of advanced electronic
medical equipment. Pioneering work has been undertaken in magnetic reso¬
nance imaging (MRI), a technique in which the patient is placed in a strong
magnetic field and scanned with radiofrequency (RF) energy. The body interacts
with this energy and the information generated is processed by computer to
construct images of internal organs and tissues. For certain types of examina¬
tion, MRI is becoming the preferred technique.
British companies also produce other advanced electronic medical equipment
including ultrasound scanners, electromyography systems and patient monitor¬
ing systems for intensive and coronary care and other uses.
The components sector manufactures a wide range of both active and passive
electronic components. The comprehensive indigenous industry is sup¬
plemented by subsidiaries of a number of large overseas companies. The sector
serves domestic requirements and is also very active in international trade. The
manufacture of integrated circuits is an area of particularly rapid change.
Britain has strength in the manufacture of advanced components, especially in
semi-custom devices such as gate arrays. In 1985 the Inmos company launched
the first of its ‘transputer' family of innovative, high-speed, 16- and 32-bit
microprocessors—‘computers on a chip’—with support devices and develop¬
ment systems.
The main products of this very important sector are power equipment
(generators, turbines, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers) and
switchgear, starting and control gear. Electrical equipment for motor vehicles
and aircraft as well as other electrical equipment for industrial use are also
produced.
All types of electrical and electronic consumer goods are produced in Britain.
The ‘white goods sector’ produces domestic appliances such as heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and driers, refrigeration appliances,
vacuum cleaners, irons and electric kettles. This sector is dominated by a few
large firms.
The major electronic goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio and video equipment. In the audio field, British
manufacturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in
the mass market. Equipment is also manufactured for reception of Britain’s
‘Prestel’ and teletext services.

h Sales of principal products.
The motor vehicle industry manufactures cars and commercial vehicles,
caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by three groups which account for 93 per cent
of car production and some 96 per cent of commercial vehicle output: Rover, in
which there is a majority public shareholding, Ford and Vauxhall. The
remainder is in the hands of smaller, specialist producers of cars, heavy
commercial vehicles, buses and coaches. The Rover board of management is
working in agreement with the Government for the return of the company, as a
whole or in parts, to the private sector. Jaguar, a luxury car manufacturer
and formerly part of the Rover group, was privatised in 1984 and has had
great success in recent years. Major makers of components include Lucas
and GKN.
In recent years the home market has been increasingly supplied by imports,
mainly from other European countries and Japan, but British manufacturers
are responding strongly to the competition, and the industry remains one of the
major export sectors. The Japanese manufacturer Nissan opened a car assembly
plant in Britain in 1986, while Rover's volume car division has reached
agreement with Honda of Japan on the production of an executive car to be built
in both Japan and Britain and on other joint projects. The principal trade
associations for the industry are the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and, on the retail side, the Motor Agents Association. Motor industry
shows are held annually at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, and in
London in alternate years.
The motor-cycle industry has contracted over the last two decades and the
domestic market is largely supplied by imports. On the other hand, the market
for pedal cycles is mainly supplied by British firms, the largest of which is TI
Raleigh.
British Rail is the dominant customer for railway equipment in the British
market, the other major user being London Regional Transport. In the past
British Rail met its rolling stock requirements from its wholly owned subsidiary,
British Rail Engineering Ltd (BREL). However, since early 1985 all British Rail's
orders have had to be put out to open tender, and BREL now competes alongside
the large private sector, which supplies a full range of equipment, including
diesel engines, transmission systems, electric traction and control gear,
signalling, heating and ventilating systems, and track equipment. The private
sector also sells to overseas railway and rapid-transit authorities, and BREL has
254
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Aerospace
begun to export as well. The private sector undertakes electrification and other
major project work abroad and, like British Rail, provides overseas consultancy
services.
Britain's aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the
Western world. The products of the industry include civil and military aircraft,
helicopters, aero-engines, guided weapons, hovercraft and space satellites,
supported by a comprehensive range of aircraft and airfield equipment and
systems.
The main British airframe manufacturer is British Aerospace (BAe), which is
privately owned. In May 1985 the Government disposed of its residual ordinary
shareholding in the company, but retained a special share which ensures that,
without government consent, no change can be made to those of BAe's articles of
association which restrict foreign ownership of shares and require the directors
to be British nationals. '
The major publicly owned companies are Rolls-Royce and Short Brothers
(although the Government plans to return Rolls-Royce to the private sector in
the first half of 1987). Rolls-Royce is responsible for almost the entire output of
aero-engines in Britain; it is one of the world's three leading aero-engine
manufacturers and over 10,000 of the world’s civil and military aircraft are
powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
Production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the BAe748 feederliner and
the BAe 125 business jet, the BAe 146 family of passenger airliners and the
Jetstream 31 executive commuter aircraft. The company is in the process of
developing an advanced turboprop airliner, which is due to enter into service in
1987. It is a highly fuel-efficient aircraft aimed at the regional airline market and
will replace the long-established BAe748. BAe is a full partner in the European
consortium Airbus Industrie; it manufactures the wings for the A300 Airbus
and designs and manufactures the wings for the A310 derivatives and for the
150-seat A320 Airbus, which is scheduled to enter into service in spring 1988.
Military aircraft include the unique Harrier vertical/short take-off and landing
aircraft, the Hawk advanced trainer, the Anglo-French Jaguar tactical fighter/
operational trainer and the Tornado multi-role combat aircraft, a collaborative
venture involving Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. The same
three countries are also planning to build a fighter aircraft for service in 1995.
with British Aerospace as the main British airframe contractor.
BAe is also a major producer of guided weapons including the Rapier
ground-to-air missile. Collaborative guided weapon projects between Britain
and its NATO partners are becoming increasingly important.
Short Brothers, which is based in Belfast, produces the Skyvan transporter,
the SD330 and 360 commuter airliners, airframe components and missiles. In
March 1985 the company was awarded a contract to supply a new basic trainer
aircraft, the Tucano, to the Royal Air Force. In addition to performing a wide
range of aerospace equipment work, Westland Helicopters manufactures the Sea
King and Lynx military helicopters and in 1982 introduced the W30 helicopter
for civil offshore and commuter uses. The development of the E101 multi-role
helicopter is being undertaken by Westland in collaboration with the Italian
company Giovanni Agusta.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the collaboratively produced
RBI99 for the Tornado, the RB211 civil engine family, the Pegasus vectored-
thrust engine for the Harrier and the Gem helicopter engine. The company is a
significant participant in the V2500 project (an engine being developed by the
International Aero Engine Company, a five-nation consortium, to power
150-passenger airliners) and is developing a new helicopter engine, the
RTM322, in partnership with Turbomeca of France. Rolls-Royce has an

agreement with General Electric of the United States on mutual participation in
the high technology developments of their respective commercial engines.
Industrial versions of Rolls-Royce aero-engines are being produced for use in oil
and gas transmission and as stand-by power generators, while marine versions
are used to power a new generation of warships.
Aviation equipment manufacturers provide a wide range of systems essential
to engines and aircraft, including engine and flight controls, electrical genera¬
tion, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings, flight decks
and information displays. They also supply radar and air traffic control
equipment, ground power supplies and flight simulators, to airports and
airlines throughout the world.
The aerospace industry carries out an extensive programme of research and
development on airframes, aero-engines and equipment, including avionics,
while considerable research is also undertaken by universities and government
research establishments. As a result of research carried out in Britain and
elsewhere, the industry is now able to make extensive use of lightweight carbon
fibre composites (as alternatives to traditional metals) and of advanced digital
cockpit controls and computer-controlled electronic signalling. It is also
expecting to use aluminium lithium to replace more conventional metals.
Aerospace production and exports, which are fairly evenly divided between
aircraft, engines and equipment (including avionics), have made considerable
progress over the past few years and now stand at record levels.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aerospace
Companies, which organises a major international air show at Farnborough,
Hampshire, every two years (the next is in 1988).
Britain was one of the first countries to develop space science and technology
and remains one of the few countries that has both built and launched its own
satellites. While retaining an involvement in space transportation systems,
particularly through Ferranti’s production of the inertial guidance system for
the European rocket, Ariane, the space industry’s major strength is now in the
manufacture of satellites. BAe has been prime contractor for all the telecom¬
munications satellite projects of the European Space Agency (ESA), including
the series of five European Communications Satellites for EUTELSAT (the
European telecommunications satellite authority) and the large multi-mission
satellite, Olympus, to be launched in 1987, equipped with experimental
direct-broadcasting-by-satellite channels, an advanced on-board switched
multi-beam business services payload by Marconi Defence Systems (MDS) and
an experimental payload to explore new frequencies for commercial services.
Internationally, BAe has a major role—larger than that of any company outside
the United States in the latest series of INTELSAT-6 global telecommunica¬
tions satellites now being built for the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organisation, and it is leading the team which will supply between
three and nine satellites for the second generation system of the International
Maritime Satellite Organisation, commencing in 1988. BAe has also developed
and built some 17 space pallets (payload and instrument carriers) for the United
States Space Shuttle; the pallets can fly either as part of Europe’s Spacelab or
independently.
MDS has primed many telecommunications satellite payloads, including
those for the maritime communications satellites; it is also a world-wide
supplier of satellite sub-systems. Currently the company is leading the payload
development for Europe’s advanced remote sensing satellite, ERS-1, investigat¬
ing oceans and coastal regions, as well as that for Britain's own Skynet-IV
defence communications satellites. On the latter project MDS is in a joint
partnership with BAe.

The space industry continues to contribute to the ESA’s scientific satellites
through BAe’s prime contractorship for the Giotto satellite which investigated
Halley’s Comet in 1986. British firms will be leading the development of the
man-tended platforms which will form part of the ESA’s Columbus programme,
expected to be operational from 1994. Britain’s space industry capabilities also
extend to the design and manufacture of all types of satellite ground stations to
meet the requirements of British Telecom and for business and data com¬
munications and television transmission.
British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce are working on the development of a new
spacecraft able to take off like an aircraft and powered, both in its flight through
the atmosphere and in space, by a single engine. It is known as ‘HOTOL’
(horizontal take-off and landing). Savings in weight would be achieved by
designing the engine so that it could ‘breathe in’ air from the atmosphere to add
to its fuel mix.
Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding and remains active in
the construction, conversion and repair of merchant vessels, warships and
offshore structures. In 1985 British shipbuilding companies accounted
for about 1 per cent of total world completions; over 55 per cent of output
was for overseas registration. Most of the major British shipyards have been
reorganised in recent years, with the construction, in several cases, of
covered-berth ship facilities which are among the most advanced and efficient
in the world.
The public sector, which comprises British Shipbuilders and the Belfast
company of Harland & Wolff, accounted for some 94 per cent of British merchant
shipbuilding in 1985 and for all slow-speed marine diesel engines. Because of
world-wide over-capacity in the general shipbuilding sector, British Shipbuild¬
ers is now moving into more specialist areas including ferries and offshore
support vessels of various kinds. Production has been modernised through
computer-aided design and manufacture and the development of the modular
approach to shipbuilding, which involves the building up of vessels from major
sub-assemblies that are supplied already fitted with pipework and electrical and
other systems.
The building of warships and other associated craft—both for the Royal Navy
and for export—is now the major area of shipbuilding in Britain. In line with
government policy, British Shipbuilders’ warship building yards, along with
general marine engineering work and ship repairing activities, have been
transferred to the private sector. The Royal Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport,
which refit ships of the Royal Navy, are to be leased to commercial management
by April 1987.
The private sector plays an important role in the construction and repair of
tugs, purpose-built coasting and short-sea cargo vessels, smaller product
tankers, fishing boats, and other small craft which are required to meet the
needs of the armed forces, harbour and pilotage authorities, and the leisure
market.
The private sector also provides the offshore oil and gas industry with
consultancy services (including advice on exploiting hydrocarbons under
difficult conditions) and has modern and well-equipped construction facilities
able to build all types of fixed platforms and semi-submersible units for drilling,
production and emergency/maintenance support, drillships, jack-up rigs,
modules and offshore loading systems. The world’s first manned submersible
made largely of glass-reinforced plastics was built by a British company, and a
wide range of submersible and other operational equipment is marketed.
Conventional yards within British Shipbuilders can also supply both traditional
and specialised support vessels.

Britain has one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated food processing
industries, and processed foods have accounted for a growing proportion of total
domestic demand for food in recent decades, though the rate of growth has
slowed since the early 1970s. Convenience foods, particularly certain frozen
foods, yoghurts and instant snacks, have formed the fastest-growing sector. The
market is also growing in foods for consumers concerned about the effects of
their diet on their health and weight. The Government is legislating to require
the fat content of processed foods to be marked on labelling. A high rate of
innovation applies to processed foods, largely owing to the need to increase sales
in a food market which is not growing in size, given a nearly static population.
While Britain is a net importer of foodstuffs, the level of imports declined
between 1970 and 1980, though it has since risen somewhat. The most marked
reductions in imports have been in dairy, meat, fish, fruit and vegetable
products, and oils and fats. Exports, mainly within the European Community,
have grown steadily. Basic research is being conducted into yeasts and new
sources of protein. Ranks Hovis McDougall and ICI have agreed on a joint
biotechnology venture to produce on a large scale myco-protein, a natural
micro-fungus which converts carbohydrates to high-grade protein; the product
will be used to make, among other things, meat, poultry and fish substitutes.
Food from Britain is a body with a wide remit to improve the marketing of
British food and agricultural produce both domestically and overseas. In 1985 it
launched a quality assurance scheme based on a ‘foodmark’ guarantee of
quality.
The industry uses about one-quarter of Britain’s pigmeat in the production of
cured bacon and ham, and one-third is processed into sausages, pies, canned
hams, pates and similar products. Other meat products include canned and
preserved meat, meat extracts and pastes and meat used to prepare other

foodstuffs. A wide range of fish, including shellfish, is processed by freezing,
canning, smoking or coating in batter or breadcrumbs. Products include fish
portions, complete fish meals, smoked fish and spreads.
Production of milk was some 15,411 million litres in 1985, of which just under
half was for sale as liquid milk. Nine out of ten households in Britain receive
pasteurised milk in bottles through a daily door-step delivery system employing
about 41,000 roundsmen (not included in the employment figure in the table)
driving electric vehicles. There are 773 establishments buying and heat-treating
milk for liquid sales. Domestic milk consumption per head (1-9 litres—3-3
pints—per week in 1985) is among the highest in the world.
The main milk products are butter (204,000 tonnes produced in 1985), cheese
(253,000 tonnes), cream (46,000 tonnes), full-cream condensed milk (169,000
tonnes), full-cream milk powder (48,000 tonnes) and skimmed milk powder
(235,000 tonnes). The dairy industry accounted for 64 per cent of new butter
supplies to the British market in 1985, 67 per cent of new cheese supplies, and
nearly all of other milk products. Production of butter and cheese has increased
significantly in recent years: butter exports in 1985 were 33,000 tonnes and
cheese exports 29,000 tonnes, compared with 16,000 tonnes and 10,700 tonnes
respectively in 1976. The other main exports are skimmed milk powder
(158,000 tonnes in 1985) and whole milk powder (42,000 tonnes). The
industry’s interests are represented by the Dairy Trade Federation.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen, crystallised and dried fruit
and vegetables, prepared nuts, pectin, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces.
Other products of the food processing industry include sugar, sugar prepara¬
tions and honey, egg-based products, oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and spices,
and cereal preparations. The oils and fats industry comprises a small number of
seed-crushing companies (producing about 417,000 tonnes of crude oil a year)
and several refiners, with a combined output of about a million tonnes of refined
oils and fats. These products are used for a number of purposes including food
manufacturing, animal feedingstuffs, soap and paints.
About 60 per cent of bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process (the ‘Chorleywood’ process) developed by
the industry's principal research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking
Research Association, and now widely used in other countries. Two groups are
predominant: Associated British Foods and Ranks Hovis McDougall. There is a
growing consumer interest, however, in locally baked varieties, production of
which is usually allied to the production of cakes and other flour confectionery.
In recent years demand for wholemeal bread has grown considerably. Biscuits
and related products are a major sector of the industry and have gained a
world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain milling and the production of
various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small
companies. The three main manufacturers are Rowntree Mackintosh, Cadbury
Schweppes and Mars. Britain has a large share of world trade in chocolate and
sugar confectionery.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and in
the food and drink industry as a whole, is Scotch whisky. There are about 100
distilleries in Scotland and the well-known brands of blended Scotch whisky are
made from the products of a number of different distilleries. Guinness pic,
owners of Arthur Bell and Sons and the Distillers Company, accounts for about
"0 per cent of Scotch whisky output. Over 80 per cent of all Scotch whisky

produced is exported. The principal overseas markets are the United States
(which takes nearly 30 per cent of whisky exports from Britain), the rest of the
European Community and Japan. Production of gin in Britain rose steadily
from the early 1950s until 1980; some of the larger manufacturers own
distilleries overseas. Production of vodka in Britain also increased in the 1970s.
In the brewing and malting industry there are six major brewery groups whose
products are sold nationally, and about 60 smaller enterprises who mainly
supply locally or regionally. In addition, there are about 100 small independent
brewers, many producing traditional cask-conditioned ales, for which there has
been a growing demand in the last decade. Firms have introduced new
production methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated
batch production plants are well established. The main raw materials used are
malt, hops and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from
home-grown barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. Lager has
increased steadily in popularity since the late 1960s and accounts for nearly 40
per cent of beer sales.
Cider, perry and wine producers form the smallest sector of the drinks
industry and are located mostly in southern and south-western England. Cider
sales rose sharply in the early 1980s, but have now stabilised at 1983 levels.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There are
some very large companies among about 20 producing brands which are
marketed on a national scale, while other companies supply regional markets.
There is some specialisation among firms in the production of various types,
such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, ‘mixers’,
fruit juices and health drinks.
The British tobacco industry manufactures about 80 per cent of cigarettes and
tobacco goods sold in Britain. Over 90 per cent of output is provided by three
major manufacturers (the Imperial Group, Gallaher and Carreras Rothmans).
The industry specialises in the production of high-quality cigarettes made from
flue-cured tobacco and achieves significant exports, mainly of cigarettes—
countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are important markets.
Britain’s most important source of raw tobacco is Brazil, followed by the United
States, Zimbabwe, India and Canada. By voluntary agreement with the
Government, cigarette manufacturers restrict their advertising, print health
warnings on packets and are reducing the tar yield of cigarettes.

Despite its contraction over a number of years, this is still a large group of
related industries, employing 500,000 people and making substantial exports.
Its main products are yarn, woven and knitted fabrics, apparel, household
textiles and carpets based mainly on wool, cotton and man-made fibres. The
textiles industry is made up of a few large multi-process companies such as
Courtaulds and Coats Viyella, and a large number of small and medium-sized
firms.
The textiles and clothing industries in Britain, as in other developed
countries, have been affected by low-cost imports from developing countries.
Trade in textiles and clothing is regulated by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The MFA allows a measure of
restraint on imports of textiles and clothing from low-cost countries into
industrialised countries; negotiations on a fourth MFA began in 1986. The use
of computers and robots and other automated techniques in production
processes is helping the textiles, footwear and clothing industries to compete
against low-cost countries.
In 1985 exports of tops (combed wool and hair), yarns, fabrics and other wool
textile products exceeded imports by about 37 per cent. The industry is one of
the largest in the world and includes the world’s biggest wool textile company,
Illingworth, Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and worsted. An
increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area but Scotland and the west of England are also
famous as specialised producers of high-quality yarn and cloth. Large quantities
of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain in preparation for spinning.
British mills also process the bulk of rare fibres, such as cashmere and mohair,
entering world trade. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are the
rest of the European Community, Japan and the United States.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary reorganisation,
modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Production includes
yarns and fabrics of cotton, spun man-made fibres and mixtures of these.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The hosiery and knitwear industry comprises about 900 companies situated
mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland, of which most are small to medium
in size. The industry produces fabrics, outerwear, underwear, tights, socks,
stockings, gloves and accessories.
Some 60 per cent of the value of carpet and rug output (70 per cent in volume
terms) is made up of tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually
with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing.
Woven carpets, mainly Axminster, account for most of the remainder of sales.
There is a higher wool content in woven types, although in these, too, more use
is being made of man-made fibres. The high quality and variety of design make
Britain one of the world’s leading producers of woven carpets.
Jute
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and man-made
polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets, cordage and ropes

and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the packaging,
upholstery, building and motor-car industries. New uses for jute, for example as
a plastics reinforcement and for decorative wall coverings, have also been
developed.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe; it is highly labour
intensive with about 5,800 companies (predominantly small ones), accounting
for 3 to 4 per cent of Britain’s total employment in the manufacturing sector. It
supplies about two-thirds of domestic demand, while exports have risen since
the mid-1970s. A wide range of clothing is imported from European and Asian
countries.
The footwear manufacturing industry is made up predominantly of small
companies. Though necessarily largely labour intensive, the industry includes
some of the most technologically up-to-date factories in the world and supplies
more than 40 per cent of all the shoes sold in Britain. Imports have risen in
recent years, but latterly at a very slow rate. Leather tanning and the
manufacture of leather goods are also long-established industries; all types of
leather (particularly for footwear, clothing and gloves) and leather goods are
produced, and about one-third of leather production is exported.

The furniture industry comprises about 3,000 companies, mostly small to
medium-sized with only a few of any significant size. A wide range of products is
manufactured, the greater part of production being accounted for by domestic
furniture and the remainder by office, contract, school and other furniture.
Domestic production of softwood timber has been steadily increasing but the
timber-using industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large
proportion of timber sales goes to the construction industry.
There were about 110 paper and board mills in 1985, operated by 80 companies;
total production was 3-7 million tonnes. The largest British groups are Wiggins
Teape, the Dickinson Robinson Group, Reed International and the Bowater
Corporation. Overseas paper and board groups with manufacturing invest¬
ments in Britain include Georgia Pacific, Kimberly Clark and Consolidated
Bathurst. The main types of paper and board produced are printing and writing
papers and board, corrugated case materials, packaging paper and board, and
tissue. There has been a significant trend towards waste-based packaging
grades in order to reduce the industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp supplies.
The use of recycled waste paper is increasing and research is helping to extend

it. Waste paper provides over half of the industry’s fibre needs. Domestically
produced wood pulp represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of products,
including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging and business station¬
ery products.
The printing and publishing industries produce a wide range of items,
including newspapers, periodicals, books, business stationery and greetings
cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper,
magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing, engraving,
bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially industries of
small firms. The book publishing industry is a major exporter. Production
processes include high-speed printing, electronic engraving, advanced pro¬
cesses of photographic reproduction and computer typesetting. Security
printers (of, for example, banknotes and postage stamps) have a high reputation
and are important exporters, the major company being De La Rue. The most
important overseas markets for printed matter are the United States, Australia
and the Irish Republic.
Tyres and tubes represent about 41 per cent of sales of rubber manufactures,
the most important other goods being vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, industrial, hydraulic and marine hoses, latex foam
products and rubber footwear, gloves and clothing. Rubber is also used for
inflatable life-rafts, containers for fuel and other industrial liquids, and seals for
storage tanks and other products where there are problems of air exclusion and
vapour suppression. Tyre manufacturers include subsidiaries of United States
and other overseas companies. The industry’s consumption of rubber includes
natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
In addition to plastics components and accessories supplied to many different
industries, the plastics processing industry manufactures a wide range of
building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and
other products. It also supplies packaging products, including bottles, contain¬
ers and bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware; many kinds of household
goods; and vinyl and other floorcoverings. Extensive research is being con¬
ducted into the use of plastics in engineering products, particularly those
associated with transport.
There are about 500 manufacturers of a wide range of toys and games, but few of
significant size. About 40 per cent of total production is exported, the major
markets being France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.
British diecast toys and plastic toys (including model construction kits) are well
established in overseas markets.
There are about 350 manufacturers of sports equipment, many of which are
small companies with a high reputation for craftsmanship. British fishing
tackle and golf and tennis equipment have a world-wide reputation. The main
export markets are France, the rest of the European Community and the United
States.
Jewellery, gold and silverware and the refining of precious metals is an industry
in which British craftsmen are world famous. The Royal Mint makes coins for
some 67 overseas countries. Other miscellaneous manufacturing includes
musical instruments, film processing and small stationery goods.

The construction industry accounts for 6 per cent of gross domestic product.
The total value of output in Great Britain in 1985 was £27.870 million, of which
new work accounted for £14,924 million (53 per cent) and repairs and
maintenance the remainder. In housing, new work was valued at £4,764 million
and repairs and maintenance at £6,820 million. About 1 million people are
employed in the industry (including apprentices), accounting for nearly 5 per
cent of total employment. There are also about 469,000 self-employed.
The industry includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair,
and maintenance of buildings, highways, bridges, tunnels, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore
structures, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, and structural
work connected with power stations and telecommunications. Efficiency and
productivity within the industry are benefiting from new computerised tech¬
niques such as the use of electronic load safety measures for cranes, distance
measuring equipment, computerised stock ordering and job costing, and
computer-aided design.
Government sponsorship of the construction industry is the responsibility of
the Department of the Environment. Building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and Wales. Made by the Secretary of State
for the Environment and administered and enforced by local authorities, the
regulations apply to new building, the installation or replacement of fittings,
and alterations and extensions to existing buildings. There are broadly similar
controls under separate legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland. As an
alternative to local authority building control and in order to simplify proce¬
dures, an optional system of private certification of compliance with building
regulations is provided for in the Housing and Building Control Act 1984 and
was introduced in 1985. The British Board of Agrement, sponsored by the
Department, assesses and issues reports and certificates relating to products
and systems for use in the construction industry.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1985 about 89 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were about 95,000 firms
employing two or more people, 95 per cent of them employed fewer than 25.
Some large firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake responsi¬
bility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The latter, acting on behalf of a client, may advise on the
feasibility of projects, draw up plans and supervise the construction work.
The Property Services Agency (PSA), which is an integral part of the
Department of the Environment, is responsible for the construction pro¬
grammes undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed
forces both in Britain and overseas.
During 1985 a total of 194,300 dwellings were started in Great Britain. Starts in
the public sector were 33,000 and those for private owners 161,200. Some
187,000 dwellings were completed, 38,200 in the public sector and 148,800 in
the private sector.
Among important construction projects in hand or recently completed in Britain
were the Heysham and Torness nuclear power stations, the Thames Barrier,
which forms part of London’s flood defences, new air terminals at Heathrow and

Gatwick, the new Lloyd’s insurance building, the Queen Elizabeth II Conference
Centre in London, the new British Library, the Docklands Light Railway, and
the M25 motorway.
The national research and advisory body on all aspects of construction and
building is the Building Research Establishment, which is part of the
Department of the Environment. It has four laboratories, including a fire
research station.
Research is also carried out by the major construction and materials firms,
universities, colleges of technology and research associations. The research
associations also provide advisory services.
The Building Centre Group consists of six building centres throughout
Britain, most of which provide exhibition and information services on mate¬
rials, products, techniques and building services.
In 1984—85 the value of new contracts obtained overseas by British construction
companies amounted to £2,400 million, compared with £2,300 million in the
previous year. Work worth a further £2,400 million was carried out overseas in
the year, a slightly higher figure than in the previous year. The value of work
outstanding at the end of the year remained unchanged at £3,200 million. There
was a movement away from traditional markets, such as Africa and the Middle
East, towards the Americas and east Asia. Major contracts obtained in 1984—85
included a new arrivals terminal at Dubai airport, a major share of an
Anglo-German project for the installation of a microwave communications
system serving the whole of Malaysia, a share of the early phases of the
Singapore mass rapid transit railway, further work on the Cairo wastewater
project and a share of the construction of two tunnels under the Anacostia river
in Washington, D.C., for the latest addition to the Washington metro system.
The interests of the various sectors of the construction industry overseas are
promoted by the Export Group for the Constructional Industries, the Associa¬
tion of Consulting Engineers, the British Consultants Bureau (whose members
include architects, surveyors and management consultants), the Buildings
Materials Export Group, and the Federation of Manufacturers of Construction
Equipment and Cranes.
Service Industries
Growth has been faster in the service sector in Britain than in the rest of the
economy in recent decades. In 1985 services contributed about 58 per cent of
gross domestic product compared with 45 per cent in 1960 and accounted for
65 per cent of employees in employment compared with 48 per cent in 1960.
Overseas trade in services, particularly financial services, has also grown, and in
1985 overseas earnings from services amounted to nearly half the value of
exports of manufactures.
Between 1976 and 1985 total service employment rose by over 1 million,
compared with a fall in employment in all other sectors. Much of this, however,
was accounted for by growth in part-time (principally female) employment. Since
the late 1970s employment has grown more rapidly in the private sector than in
the public sector, a reversal of the pattern of the 1960s and the early 1970s,
partially reflecting the Government’s policy of restricting employment in public
sector services.
The fastest-growing sectors within services in the 1970s, measured by
employment, were financial and business services, professional and scientific
services (mainly health and education) and miscellaneous services (mainly
leisure and personal services). In the 1980s the financial services have
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
265
DISTRIBUTION
WHOLESALE
TRADES
continued to grow strongly. Among trends in the miscellaneous sector is a
growth in franchising, an operation in which a company owning the rights to a
particular form of trading sells them to franchisees, usually by means of an
initial payment with continuing royalties. Hotel, catering and cleaning
businesses are the main services in which franchising has developed.
Among the reasons for the growth in services is the fact that real personal
disposable income has more than doubled since 1945. As real incomes rise
people tend to spend a greater proportion of income on personal, financial and
leisure services. While, to some extent, consumers have exchanged services
(such as public transport, laundries and cinemas) for goods (motor cars,
washing-machines and television sets), this has generated demand for fresh
services in the distribution, maintenance and repair of these goods. Increased
consumer expenditure on the running costs of motor cars is a significant factor
in the rise in consumer expenditure on services. Demand for British air travel,
hotel and catering services has resulted from the increase in real incomes in
other countries.
Other factors include a greater readiness to use banking services and the
spread of home ownership, which has increased demand for legal and estate
agency services. Demographic changes, such as the increase in the elderly as a
component of the population, help to explain the growth of medical services.
Shorter working hours tend to raise the demand for leisure services.
Changes in technology have also played a part in the growth of services.
Examples range from the computer services industry to the provision of cash
and credit by means of cards and the growth of information systems such as
viewdata and teletext. It is thought that there are now about 1 million people
employed in the ‘tradeable information sector’, which encompasses activities
such as the supply of financial and business information, printing and
publishing, on-line computerised technical services, consultancy, and aspects of
education and training services and of the entertainment industry.
There were over 4 million people engaged in the distributive and allied trades in
Great Britain in mid-1985, together with a large number of owners of
businesses. There were 932,000 people in wholesaling, just over 2 million in
retailing, 1 million in hotels and catering, and 206,000 in the repair of vehicles
and consumer goods. The distributive and allied trades accounted for about
13 per cent of national income in 1985.
In 1984 there were some 108,400 businesses engaged in wholesaling and
dealing, with a turnover (including sales to other wholesalers and dealers) of
some £159,000 million. The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are
groceries and provisions, petroleum products, and ores and metals. A number of
large retailers carry out the functions of the wholesaler by having their own
warehouses and buying and distributive organisations.
The wholesale grocery trade had a turnover of some £6,080 million in 1984.
The trade is divided between ‘cash and carry’ and the traditional delivered trade
in a ratio of 2 to 1. The cash and carry sector, with some 560 depots, grew in
importance during the 1960s and 1970s by offering discounts to customers who
purchased in bulk and limiting expenditure on premises, credit and delivery
facilities. Grocery wholesaling has greatly diminished in recent years; over
two-thirds of groceries are now delivered direct from manufacturers to the large
multiple food retailers, by-passing the traditional wholesalers.
Landmark, Nurdin and Peacock, the Dee Corporation and Booker predomin¬
ate in the wholesale grocery trade. London's wholesale markets play a significant
part in the distribution of foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main market for
fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
266
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
RETAIL
TRADES
The co-operative movement in Britain has its own wholesale organisation, the
Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), to serve the needs of retail societies; its
turnover was £2,345 million in 1985—86. Retail societies are encouraged to buy
from the CWS, which supplies about two-thirds of their requirements.
In the grocery trade there are a number of voluntary groups which have been
formed by wholesalers with small independent retailers, whereby the retailers
are encouraged by discounts and other incentives to buy as much as possible
from the wholesaler. This has helped to preserve many smaller retail outlets for
the wholesaler, including the traditional ‘corner shops’ and village stores, of
value to local communities, and has given small retailers the advantages of bulk
buying and co-ordinated distribution.
Turnover of the retail trades has been growing slowly in real terms in recent
years, despite the recession. In 1985 retail sales were 12 per cent higher than in
1984, representing, however, only a 5 per cent increascin volume. In 1984 there
were an estimated 231,000 businesses in the retail trade in Great Britain each
with a turnover of more than £18,700 (see Table 19). Their turnover was about
£82,000 million and they invested £2,100 million. As the large multiple retailers
(those with ten or more outlets) have grown in size and diversified their product
ranges, there has been a decline in the number of retail businesses and outlets.
The decline has been particularly evident among small independent businesses
and retail co-operative societies. Shops selling durable household goods have
experienced the fastest growth in turnover in recent years, while mixed retail
businesses have recorded the slowest growth.
The largest multiple retailers in the packaged grocery market are the retail
co-operatives, Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, Dee Corporation, Argyll Stores, Fine
Fare, Safeway Food Stores and Kwik Save Discount Group. Retail co-operative
societies are voluntary organisations controlled by their members, membership
being open to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share; at the end of
1985 the 103 retail societies had over 8 million members and more than 5,300
retail outlets. Turnover in 1985 amounted to in excess of £4,800 million. Retail
co-operatives and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (see above) are members of
the Co-operative Union as are a number of other co-operative bodies such as the
Co-operative Bank. In 1985—86 Sainsbury had about 266 stores and sales were
valued at £3,575 million. Tesco had some 365 outlets and the company’s sales
amounted to £3,335 million.
The leading mixed retail businesses are Marks and Spencer (with sales of
£3,658 million in 1985-86), Boots, F. W. Woolworth, the John Lewis Part¬
nership, House of Fraser, W. H. Smith & Son, Debenhams and British Home
Stores.
There are a number of discount stores operating on the principle of selling
most or all of their goods at a reduced price. Electrical goods, furniture, carpets
and do-it-yourself supplies are some of the main items sold by discount stores.
About 20 million people regularly shop by post. In 1985 sales by general mail
order firms totalled some £2,952 million, representing 3 -4 per cent of retail sales
and 6-6 per cent of retail sales excluding food shops. The volume of mail order
sales increased rapidly in the 1970s but fell off somewhat after 1980. Leading
items sold by mail order are clothing, footwear, furniture, household textiles,
and radio, television and electrical goods. The two main mail order firms are
Great Universal Stores and Littlewoods.
One of the most significant trends in retailing in recent years has been the
increase in the proportion of turnover accounted for by large multiple retailers;
they have 58 per cent of retail turnover. Other important trends have been the
increase in very large self-service stores selling a wide variety of products.

There are supermarkets in most towns and cities in Britain. The main multiple
grocery companies have been steadily increasing the size of their main
supermarkets. The trend to greater size has led to a growing number of
superstores and hypermarkets, self-service stores offering a wider range of food
and non-food merchandise and which have at least 2,500 sq m (26,900 sq ft)
and 5,000 sq m (53,800 sq ft) respectively of selling space. They are designed
primarily for shoppers with cars, and substantial free car-parking space is
usually provided. In Britain the first such store was opened in the mid-1960s
and by January 1985 there were some 302 superstores and 44 hypermarkets,
while planning permission for a further 61 superstores and six hypermarkets
had been granted. Government policy on planning and large retail development
was reaffirmed in 1985 when local planning authorities were urged to take
account of the trend for new stores to be located outside existing shopping
centres and of the benefits to the public of a wide range of shopping facilities.
Although commercial competition is not a planning consideration, it was
emphasised that authorities will, exceptionally, need to take into account the
effect of the trend on the vitality and viability of established town centres. Since
1980 there has been an increase in ‘mini-superstores’ in the range 1,000 to
2,500 sq m (10,760 to 26,900 sq ft).

Britain has a variety of new purpose-built shopping centres. The largest are the
Manchester Arndale and the centre in Milton Keynes, which, both covering more
than 93,000 sq m (1 million sq ft), are among the largest in Europe. Other large
centres are at Town Square, Basildon, the Eldon Square Development in
Newcastle upon Tyne, Brent Cross in London, the Mander Centre in Wolver¬
hampton and the Luton Arndale.
Many of the large multiple groups have diversified over the last few years to offer
a much bigger range of goods and services than previously. This has been
especially noticeable for the large food retailers, which often sell non-food
products, such as beer, wines and spirits, clothing and household appliances,
as well as packaged groceries. Another trend is that many superstores and large
supermarkets offer fresh as well as packaged food, often with special counters or
areas for fresh meat, fish, vegetables and bread baked on the premises. Some
large retailers have in recent years begun to provide financial and estate agency
services.
Retailers are placing greater emphasis both on price competition and quality as
a means of promoting sales. With the growth of payments by credit card, certain
of the large retailers have issued their own credit cards for regular customers in
an attempt to increase sales, particularly of high-value goods.
Laser-scanning electronic check-outs are already having a major impact on
retailing in Britain. A low-power laser beam at the point of sale scans a bar code
on the package of each item and the price is automatically retrieved from a
central computer. The customer is given a receipt showing the price and identity
of each item purchased, while the store’s stock records are altered automatically.
Substantial savings are expected from improved stock control and a reduction of
individual price marking in stores. Key Markets introduced the first operational
laser-scanning electronic check-out in Britain at Spalding (Lincolnshire) in
1979. Computerised shopping services are being introduced in the home which
enable people to order goods from retailers. Some large multiple retailers are
using electronic order and invoice systems in dealing with their suppliers,
following a legal change permitting tax invoices in forms other than paper. Small
independent retailers, also, are using electronic ordering, pricing and delivery
systems. High-speed labelling techniques, including the use of electronic
printers which can overprint labels, the use of pressure-sensitive glues and
printing in foil instead of ink, are being adopted in order to save time and labour
costs.
A single nationwide ‘electronic funds transfer at the point of sale’ (EFT-POS)
system is to be established for the retail market in co-operation with the English
and Scottish clearing banks. The system will use magnetically striped cards and
terminals installed in retail premises to transfer funds directly from card¬
holders' accounts to the accounts of retailers. Various pilot projects are already
in operation.
In June 1985 some 270,000 people were employed in Great Britain in the retail
distribution of motor vehicles and parts and in petrol stations. In spite of the
continuing increase in the number of road vehicles, the number of petrol
stations is declining and at the end of 1985 there were some 21,140 (4 per cent
fewer than in 1984), of which 32 per cent were owned by oil companies. There
were about 10,568 outlets selling diesel fuel. Self-service stations are becoming
increasingly important and in 1985 they accounted for 39 per cent of petrol
stations. Some 176,000 people were employed in the repair of motor vehicles in
mid-1985.

The hotel and catering trades employed 1 million people in Great Britain in
mid-1985: 262,000 in hotels and other residential establishments; 192,000 in
restaurants, cafes and snack bars; 258,000 in public houses and bars; 155,000
in clubs; and 120,000 in canteens. A large number of self-employed people are
also engaged in hotels and catering. There were 12,900 hotel businesses in
Great Britain in 1984, with a turnover of £3,370 million. Many licensed hotels
as well as most of the numerous guest houses are small, with fewer than 20
rooms. Of the major hotel business groups the biggest is Trusthouse Forte Ltd,
which runs 800 hotels including 200 in Britain, and has catering and leisure
interests. The total turnover of holiday camps and camping and caravan sites
was about £456 million in 1984. Among the largest firms running holiday
centres (including holiday camps with full board, self-catering centres and
caravan parks) are Butlins, Pontins, Ladbroke Holidays, Warners and Haven
Leisure. There were over 41,900 businesses in Great Britain in 1984 with a total
turnover of more than £3,770 million, which were engaged in the sale of food for
consumption both on and off the premises. These include restaurants, snack
bars, cafes, fish and chip shops and other establishments selling ‘take-away’
food. Britain has a veiy wide range of restaurants of which a substantial number
specialise in the dishes of other countries such as Chinese, Italian, Indian and
Greek foods. ‘Fast-food’ catering, in which establishments sell hot food such as
hamburgers or chicken to be eaten either on the premises or elsewhere, is
becoming increasingly significant. There are about 60,800 ‘pubs’ (public
houses, which mainly sell beer, wines and spirits for consumption on the
premises) in Great Britain, with a total turnover of £6,760 million in 1984.
Business services include advertising, market research, management consul¬
tancy, exhibition and conference facilities, computer services and auction
houses. Most of these sectors have grown rapidly in recent years.
Advertising expenditure rose by 3 per cent in 1985 to £4,441 million, according
to the Advertising Association. Advertising in the press accounted for 63 per
cent of the total, television for 31 per cent, posters for 3-7 per cent, commercial
radio for 1 -8 per cent and cinema for 0-4 per cent. Advertising has been growing
fastest in the free distribution press and directories. Advertising campaigns are
planned mainly by advertising agencies, of which there are several hundred in
Britain; in some cases they also provide marketing, consumer research and
other services.
Britain is acknowledged as a world leader in the provision of software and
computing services, and software developed in Britain has contributed to
developments in the applications of computers in numerous countries. The
industry comprises software houses, which provide professional services such
as consultancy, the writing of programs to meet the computing needs of their
clients, and, increasingly, packaged software designed for a wider market;
computer bureaux, where the main emphasis is on processing customers’ data;
and systems houses, which specialise in the provision of complete systems
(hardware and software).
The computing services industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
British economy: annual growth has been running at between 15 and 20 per
cent a year since the mid-1970s and turnover now stands at over £2,000 million.
The industry employs around 62,000 people, excluding people working on
in-house computer activities, who number several hundred thousand. About
200 computing service companies are members of the Computing Services
Association, the leading trade association. Many of the companies are sub-

There are thought to be some 6,000 management consultants in Britain, of
whom 3,000 are practising members of the Institute of Management Consul¬
tants. Among the largest management consultancy companies are the 29
members of the Management Consultants Association, whose turnover
amounted to £168 million in 1985. Revenue earned within Britain comprised
£142 million, an increase of 40 per cent on the previous year, while overseas
revenue amounted to £26 million. The Association reports a growing demand
for services supporting the application of information technology, particularly
micro-processing, to all aspects of business.
The 31 members of the Association of Market Survey Organisations (AMSO)
accounted for about 70 per cent of total turnover by market research companies
in 1985. The turnover of AMSO members increased to £136 million in 1985
from £117 million in 1984. The largest company, the AGB group, had a turnover
of £28-7 million. Research on behalf of food and soft drinks companies
accounted for 21 per cent of revenue. Research on behalf of financial
institutions and groups with international interests has increased.
With the steady increase in new and renovated facilities, some 80 towns and
cities are well equipped to hold conferences and exhibitions. Among the most
modern facilities are the National Exhibition Centre at Birmingham, the
Wembley Conference Centre, the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre and the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in London, the Brighton Centre in
Sussex, the Harrogate Centre in North Yorkshire, the Bournemouth Interna¬
tional Centre in Dorset, St David's Hall in Cardiff, the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre in Glasgow, the G-MEX Centre in Manchester and the Royal
Centre in Nottingham. Other large facilities are the Earls Court, Olympia and
Wembley Arena sites in London. Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences (the others being the United States and
France); the Union of International Associations, based in Brussels, estimated
that about 9 per cent of the world’s main international conferences were held in
Britain in 1985. Britain is actively promoted overseas as an international
conference and exhibition venue.
Britain’s chief auction houses are active in the international auction markets for
works of art, trading on the acknowledged expertise of British valuers and
dealers. The two largest houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, are established
world-wide and had turnovers of £473 million and £365 million in 1985—86
respectively.
Other business services include land and estate companies, estate agents, and
typewriting, duplicating, document copying, translating and employment
agencies.
Some 99,000 people were employed in film, theatre, literary, musical, broadcast¬
ing and related services in Great Britain in mid-1985, 292,000 in sanitary
services, 132,000 in research and development services and 262,000 in services
connected with sport, recreation, gambling and betting. Other services provided
included hairdressing and beauty parlours (86,000 employees), laundries, dyers
and dry cleaners (65,000), photographic studios, religious organisations,
tourist offices, learned societies, employers’ and trade union organisations, and
funeral services.

TRAVEL
AND
TOURISM
Major trends in the film and television industry in recent years include the
development of the specialised film and television services sector and the
extension of video and cable television services. Technical developments, such
as the use of magnetic video tape instead of film, and the exploitation of
computer-generated graphics, have been responsible for changes both in the
production and exhibition of film and television material. They have also played
a part in the growth of the specialised sector, in which relatively small studios,
mostly based in London, provide a wide range of film and television services,
including the making of advertising films, ‘special effects' sequences for feature
and other films, documentary and educational programmes, and cartoon films.
In addition, new audio-visual technology is being adopted in industrial,
commercial, medical and scientific contexts for information, observation and
training purposes.
The Department of Trade and Industry conducts an annual inquiry into the
value of overseas transactions relating to the production and exhibition of
cinema and television material. For many years the inquiry has shown a surplus
of receipts over expenditure. In 1984 receipts by film and television companies
were £318 million, while expenditure was £195 million, a surplus of £123
million. Film companies’ receipts totalled £229 million and television com¬
panies receipts £91 million, the North American market accounting for about
three-fifths of revenue in both cases. Some 323 film companies and 18 television
broadcasting companies were covered in the 1985 inquiry.
Legislation was passed in 1985 to reduce statutory intervention in the film
industry and to increase the flow of both public and private funds for domestic
film production.
The travel business is another growth sector and some 2,685 travel agencies,
with about 6,115 offices (over 90 per cent of the total), belong to the Association
of British Travel Agents (ABTA). In general travel agents are small businesses
but many ABTA members have more than one office. There are a few large firms
(of which the biggest is Thomas Cook with over 280 branches). Computerised
information and booking systems are being introduced in travel agencies. There
are also 525 tour operator members of ABTA; some 225 companies are both
retail agents and tour operators. The leading tour operators are British Airways
(through its subsidiaries, Sovereign and Enterprise), Cosmos, Horizon,
Intasun, Rank Travel and Thomson. ABTA operates financial protection
schemes to safeguard its members’ customers, maintains codes of conduct
drawn up with the Office of Fair Trading, and offers a free conciliation service to
help to resolve complaints against members and an independent arbitration
scheme for tour operators’ customers.
Tourism is one of Britain’s most important industries and is recognised as a
major and growing source of employment. Spending by British residents and
overseas visitors on tourism in Britain during 1985 amounted to around
£12,000 million (excluding fares paid on travel to and from Britain). It is
estimated that upwards of 1 million jobs in Britain were supported directly or
indirectly by tourism spending in 1985 and that new jobs are being created at a
rate of more than 50,000 a year.
In 1985 a record 14-5 million overseas visitors to Britain (6 per cent more than
in the previous year) spent £5,451 million, 18 per cent more than in 1984.
British residents made 21-8 million trips abroad and spent £4,877 million,
giving a surplus on the travel account of £574 million. About 55 per cent of
overseas visitors to Britain came from Western Europe, 26 per cent from North
America and about 19 per cent from elsewhere in the world. There was a 1 per
cent decrease in visits abroad by British residents in 1985; the majority of visits
(88 per cent) were to Western Europe.
272
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Official support for the promotion of tourism to and within Britain is provided
by the British Tourist Authority and the tourist boards for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Funding for the tourist boards has been increased
for 1986—87 and the boards have been asked by the Government to encourage
tourism in regions of the country where unemployment is high and where there
is potential for development. Voluntary registration schemes exist for tourist
accommodation throughout Britain and facilities offered'by registered estab¬
lishments are listed in the boards’ accommodation guides. Information on
tourist facilities and accommodation is available from official information
centres throughout Britain (most of which are administered by local authorities)
and on videotex information services in Britain and overseas.
13 Energy
and Natural
Resources
Energy and non-fuel minerals make an important contribution to the British
economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in 1984 was £25,839
million, of which crude oil accounted for 79 per cent, coal 8 per cent and natural
gas 5 per cent.
All minerals in Great Britain are privately owned, with the exception of gold,
silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned by the Crown), and coal and some
minerals associated with coal. In Northern Ireland gold and silver are owned by
the Crown, while rights to petroleum and other minerals are vested in the
Government. On the United Kingdom Continental Shelf the right to exploit all
minerals except coal is vested in the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal,
or license others to do so, both on land and under the sea, is vested in the
National Coal Board. Normally, ownership of minerals belongs to the owner of
the land surface but in some areas, particularly where mining has taken place,
these rights have become separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from
coalmining, are usually carried out by privately owned companies.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Energy
Britain has the largest energy resources of any country in the European
Community and is a major world producer of oil, natural gas and coal. The other
main primary sources are nuclear power and some water power; secondary
sources are electricity, coke and very small quantities of town gas. Since 1980
Britain has been self-sufficient in energy in net terms as a result of the
continued growth in offshore oil production, and self-sufficiency should be
maintained for a number of years. Coal is the country's richest natural resource
and estimated proven recoverable reserves are 4,600 million tonnes; total coal
resources are many times higher. A major capital investment programme in the
coal industry is in progress. Nuclear power provided about 20 per cent of
electricity generated by the public supply system in 1985.
Privately owned companies predominate in offshore oil and gas production
and oil refining, while publicly owned bodies are responsible for most coal
production and electricity generation and distribution. In Great Britain the
Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for these industries, except for
electricity in Scotland which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is responsible for all energy
matters in the Province.
Energy Policy
The Government’s energy policy is designed to ensure the secure, adequate and
economic provision of energy to meet Britain's requirements. The Government
274
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ENERGY
CONSUMPTION
ENERGY
EFFICIENCY
seeks to ensure that all economic forms of energy are produced, supplied and
used as efficiently as possible, having regard also to the international
application of the technologies involved. Oil and gas resources continue to be
developed profitably. The Government attaches importance to the development
of a competitive coal industry and to the safe and economic development of
nuclear power. Particular attention is paid to achieving the most cost-effective
use of energy through the adoption of energy efficiency measures.
Britain is actively engaged in international collaboration on energy questions,
notably through its membership of the European Community and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA, a body with 21 member countries attached to
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Since its
establishment in 1974, the IEA has agreed a wide range of co-operative
measures to reduce member nations’ dependence on imported oil, and it
continues to support the adoption of realistic energy pricing policies by all
member countries, both to discourage wasteful use of energy and to stimulate
new methods of utilising and saving it.
Inland primary energy consumption amounted to 326-9 million tonnes of coal
equivalent in 1985 (see Table 20), 4-7 per cent more than in 1984, but still below
the level of the 1970s, reflecting energy conservation and lower levels of
industrial production. Consumption of coal and of oil in 1985 was affected by
unusual patterns of deliveries and changes in stocks resulting from the dispute
in the coalmining industry in 1984 and early 1985. Energy consumption by final
users in 1985 amounted to 56,333 million therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis, of
which domestic users consumed about 30 per cent, industrial users 29 per cent,
transport 27 per cent and public services 6 per cent.

The aim of obtaining the best value for money from energy consumed is an
integral part of the Government’s strategy to increase the efficiency with which
energy is supplied and used throughout the economy. Studies have indicated
that some 20 per cent of Britain's energy consumption is wasted, equivalent to
expenditure of some £7,000 million a year. In 1983 the Government set up the
Energy Efficiency Office within the Department of Energy with the objectives of
emphasising to consumers the value of using energy more efficiently and of
making Britain the most energy-efficient country in the Western world. As part
of the Office’s plan to ensure that energy users took up the schemes and services
available, 1986 was designated Energy Efficiency Year. Over 1,000 events were

held in Britain, many of them sponsored by the fuel supply industries, the
energy efficiency industries and other sectors with energy interests.
Energy ministers are engaged on a programme of meetings with senior
managers in industry, commerce and local authorities to promote the benefits of
improved energy efficiency and to increase awareness of the technology and
guidance available. By June 1986 some 20,000 senior managers had attended
these meetings. The Government’s programme on energy efficiency in industry
and commerce also includes financial assistance towards the cost of energy
efficiency surveys and the establishment of monitoring and targeting systems in
specific sectors, as well as grants for demonstration projects to stimulate the use
of new technologies or new applications of existing technology. Regional energy
efficiency officers provide help to companies and support for firms’ energy
managers, of whom there are over 8,500. Research and development pro¬
grammes include feasibility studies on combined heat and power or district
heating schemes.
In the domestic sector a show giving information and advice on energy
efficiency in the home has visited some 200 locations, including shopping
centres and home exhibitions throughout Britain. Grants are available to
householders for loft and hot water-tank insulation, and there are also grants
towards the establishment of community insulation projects to help low-income
families to install insulation. Home energy audits are being developed so that
householders can assess how efficiently they use energy.
The Government sets certain compulsory standards including minimum
insulation standards for new buildings and a maximum heated temperature of
19°C (66°F) for non-domestic buildings.
Britain’s energy position has been transformed by the discovery of substantial
oil and gas reserves offshore in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS).
The total area covered by production licences is some 107,040 sq km (43,317
sq miles) out of a total designated area of about 651,650 sq km (251,600
sq miles), over which Britain has exercised its rights to explore and exploit the
seabed and subsoil. Expenditure on offshore and onshore exploration and
development amounted to some £2,800 million in 1985. By the end of 1985,
2,864 wells had been or were being drilled in the UKCS (1,300 development
wells, 1,036 exploration wells and 528 appraisal wells).
The Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy is responsible for
ensuring that British industry has a full and fair opportunity in the supply of
goods and services to the UKCS; for supporting British firms’ research and
development projects for new products and techniques for use in oil and gas
exploration; and for promoting Britain’s offshore interests overseas. Britain's
offshore supplies industry is the second largest in the world (after that of the
United States). In 1985 goods and services valued at £3,420 million were
ordered for UKCS developments, the British share of orders received being
£2,720 million (80 per cent).
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly dependent for its oil supplies on
imports, the only indigenous supplies coming from a small number of
land-based oilfields. However, the first notable discovery of oil in the UKCS was
made in 1969 and the first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil
from the UKCS in mid-1986 was about 2-2 million barrels (290,000 tonnes) a
day, making Britain the world’s fifth largest producer.
There were 30 offshore fields producing crude oil in mid-1986. The largest fields
are Brent and Forties, while six more fields are under development; other

significant finds may prove to have commercial potential after further appraisal.
Production from most large fields is controlled from production platforms of
either steel or concrete which have been built to withstand severe weather
including gusts of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30 m
(100 ft).
Britain s primary oil production, including condensates and petroleum gases,
amounted to about 127-5 million tonnes in 1985 (see Table 21), 1-3 per cent
more than in 1984. Output is around its maximum, and production is forecast
to decline slowly in the rest of the 1980s. Britain should remain a significant
producer well into the 1990s and, on a smaller scale, into the twenty-first
century. The Government’s oil policy is intended to encourage exploration and
development with the objective of maximising economic oil production for the
foreseeable future. Remaining proven reserves of oil in the UKCS amount to
about 750 million tonnes while the total remaining reserves of the UKCS could
be as high as 4,120 million tonnes.
There are several large oil companies operating in Britain or engaged in work in
the UKCS. In total there are about 280 companies with interests in the North
Sea. The two leading British oil companies are British Petroleum (BP), in which
the Government has a 32 per cent stake, and Shell Transport and Trading,
which are the two largest industrial companies in Britain in terms of turnover.
In late 1985 a small Oil and Pipelines Agency took over the residual functions of
the British National Oil Corporation, which has been abolished. The Agency
markets the crude oil received by the Government as petroleum royalty taken in
kind, manages the Government’s pipeline and storage system, and holds the
Government’s rights under participation agreements with the oil companies.
Onshore production of crude oil is much less significant than offshore
production. In 1985 it amounted to 380,000 tonnes, about 67 per cent of which
came from Britain’s largest onshore field at Wytch Farm (Dorset), which started
production in 1979. Eleven other onshore fields are in operation, notably
Beckingham/Gainsborough and Welton in Lincolnshire, and Humbly Grove in
Hampshire.
At the beginning of 1986 the distillation capacity of Britain’s 14 oil refineries
stood at 92-8 million tonnes a year. Excess capacity is being eliminated, while
existing refineries are being adapted to the changing pattern of demand by the
construction of new upgrading facilities (‘catalytic crackers’) which are leading
to a higher output of motor spirit and naphtha at the expense of fuel oil.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1985 totalled 70-1 million tonnes, including 20-4 million
tonnes of motor spirit, 17-4 million tonnes of gas and diesel oil (including derv
fuel used in road vehicles), 16-3 million tonnes of fuel oil and 6-9 million tonnes
of kerosene.
Exports of crude oil have grown rapidly and in 1985 amounted to 79-6 million
tonnes. Virtually all exports went to Britain’s partners in the European
Community and the IEA, the largest markets being the Netherlands, France and
the United States. Some 19 million tonnes of petroleum products were also
exported. The volume of imports of crude oil has fallen considerably to about 24
per cent of the level of the peak year of 1973. Heavy crude oil continues to be
imported to enable the full range of petroleum products to be made efficiently, as
not all of these can be made from the light crude oil produced in the UKCS. The
main sources of crude oil imports in 1985 were Norway (which supplied about
44 per cent by value), Nigeria (12 per cent), and Turkey and Saudi Arabia (which
each supplied 8 per cent).

a Crude oil plus condensates and petroleum gases derived at onshore treatment plants.
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 80 per cent of offshore oil in 1985. Some
1,620 km (1,010 miles) of major submarine pipeline have been built to bring
ashore oil from a number of North Sea oilfields (see map, p 276). Major crude oil
onshore pipelines in operation from harbours, land terminals or offshore
moorings to refineries include those connecting Finnart to Grangemouth,
Tranmere to Stanlow, Amlwch to Stanlow, and Cruden Bay to Grangemouth.
Onshore pipelines also carry refined products to major marketing areas; for
example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline runs from Milford Haven to the midlands
and Manchester.
The leading oil companies have extensive research and development pro¬
grammes in support of oil exploration and production and on new and improved
fuels. All aspects of production are covered, including the design of production
facilities and enhanced oil recovery techniques. Research centres are at
Sunbury-on-Thames (BP), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Sittingbourne in
Kent (Shell), and Abingdon in Oxfordshire (Esso). The main government
research and development effort in offshore technology is undertaken by the
Department of Energy with the advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board.
In 1986—87 the Department expects to spend some £24 million in support of
offshore technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in central London. For many years gas was produced from coal but
during the 1960s, when growing supplies of oil were being imported, there was a
switch to producing town gas from oil-based feedstocks. However, in the late
1960s, following the first commercial natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965
and the start of offshore gas production in 1967, supplies of offshore natural gas
grew rapidly and natural gas has now replaced town gas in the public supply
system in Great Britain. Originally used almost exclusively for lighting, gas is
now used for domestic cooking and heating and for industrial and commercial
purposes.

The gas industry in Great Britain has been under state ownership and control
since 1949. However, in 1985 the Government announced its intention to
transfer all the assets of the British Gas Corporation to the private sector, and
the Gas Act 1986 provides for the privatisation of the Corporation and for the
sale of the successor company’s shares. In August 1986 the Corporation’s assets
were transferred to the new company, British Gas pic. The Government’s
intention is that shares in the company will be offered for sale later in 1986.
In 1985-86 the turnover of the Corporation and its subsidiary companies
amounted to £7,687 million, of which gas supply accounted for £7,109 million.
Its current cost operating profit was £688 million. British Gas has a large
investment programme, amounting to £2,500 million (at 1985 prices) in the five
years from 1985 to 1990, a large part of which is accounted for by investment in
the Rough and Morecambe fields (see below). British Gas has some 90,000
employees.
In 1985 indigenous natural gas accounted for about 74 per cent of total natural
gas supplies, the remainder coming from Norway. Production of natural gas
amounted to 42,947 million cubic metres (mem), of which 3,220 mem were used
for drilling, production and pumping operations offshore, and some 39,393
mem were used mainly by the public supply gas industry. Production comes
mainly from seven major gasfields: Leman, Frigg (UK), Indefatigable, Viking,
Hewett, West Sole and Victor. British Gas has undertaken a major investment
programme to develop the Morecambe field in the Irish Sea as an additional
source in the peak winter months, and the first supplies were brought ashore in
1985.
Total remaining recoverable gas reserves, including possible gas from existin''
discoveries and potential future discoveries, are in the range of 868,000 mem to
2-85 million mem. Indigenous offshore natural gas reserves are likely to meet
most of the demand from the British market well into the 1990s.
The British Gas national high-pressure pipeline system of some 5,600 km
(3,500 miles) provides for the distribution of natural gas. It is supplied by feeder
mains from four North Sea shore terminals, and from a new terminal in
Barrow-in-Furness (Cumbria), which began operating in 1985. The whole of the
high-pressure transmission system is regularly inspected; British Gas has
developed the world’s most advanced computerised inspection vehicle for
high-pressure pipelines that detects flaws as it travels through them.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
used including salt cavities and storage facilities for liquefied natural gas.
British Gas has also developed the partially depleted Rough field as a major gas
store. This, the first such use of an offshore field, involves the injection into the
Rough reservoir in the summer months of gas drawn from the national
transmission system for recovery during periods of peak winter demand.
Sales of gas by the public supply industry in Britain totalled 18,390 million
therms in 1985, 6-3 per cent more than in 1984. About half of all gas sold by
British Gas to its 16-8 million consumers is for industrial and commercial
purposes, the remainder being for household use. Gas is used extensively in
industries requiring the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy
such as the pottery industry and certain processes for making iron and steel
products. In 1985, 5,783 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain,
247 million therms to fuel producers and 2,678 million therms to commercial
and other non-domestic users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers,
space heaters, water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of

domestic demand is for gas for central heating. In 1985, 9,682 million therms
were sold to domestic users.
British Gas conducts research at five research stations into all aspects of gas
supply and use. Total expenditure on research and development and on
technical services and testing amounted to about £75-8 million in 1985-86.
Work on processes for the manufacture of substitute natural gas from coal is one
of its main research projects. A demonstration coal gasification plant (‘slagging
gasifier’) has been built at the Westfield Development Centre in Fife. Other
research is concerned with the design, efficient operation and maintenance of
the transmission and distribution systems, with the efficient use of gas in its
various industrial and domestic applications, and with research supporting the
exploration programme.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 292 million tonnes
of coal, exported 74-2 million tonnes and employed over a million workers. In
1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry
Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a
statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The NCB (which trades under the name British Coal) has, with limited
exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of coal in Great Britain, but is
empowered to license private operators to work small mines and opencast sites.
It also has powers to work other minerals, where discoveries are made in the
course of searching for, or working, coal; and to engage in certain petrochemi¬
cals activities beneficial to the future of the coal industry. Retail sales remain
largely in private hands, although the NCB makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers.
At the end of March 1986 there were 133 NCB collieries in operation. The main
coal-bearing regions are shown on the map on p 282.
Output recovered in 1985-86 from the low levels resulting from a lengthy
industrial dispute in 1984-85. The total output of 104-5 million tonnes
comprised 88-2 million tonnes of deep-mined coal, 14-1 million tonnes from
opencast mines and 2-2 million tonnes from other sources (including recovered
slurry).
Britain s coal industry is one of the largest in Western Europe, and one of
the world’s most technologically advanced. The NCB has a substantial
capital investment programme, which amounted to £660 million in 1985-86.
Considerable progress has been made in techniques for mining coal. Develop¬
ments are concentrated on the increasing use of heavy-duty equipment, such as
powered roof supports, power loaders and armoured flexible conveyors, capable
of sustained high performance with minimum maintenance, and on the
introduction of computerised automatic monitoring and remote control of
machines.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out because of the
early development of the industry, total coal resources in Britain are estimated
at 190,000 million tonnes, of which about 45,000 million tonnes are considered
to be recoverable using established technology and 4,600 million tonnes are
judged to be ‘proved recoverable’. Production at the new mining complex at
Selby in North Yorkshire (one of the world’s most advanced deep mines) is
planned to build up to 10 million tonnes a year. Investment of £400 million

has been allocated to develop a new mine at Asfordby in the Vale of Belvoir
(Leicestershire).
The first coal to be discovered on a significant scale in Northern Ireland is a
substantial deposit of lignite (brown coal) on the eastern shore of Lough Neagh,
where reserves are estimated at 420 million tonnes. Further deposits have been
discovered and are being appraised to determine their size and the feasibility of
mining.
In 1985—86 inland consumption of coal was 118-4 million tonnes of which 73
per cent was by power stations, 10 per cent by coke ovens and 10 per cent by
domestic users. With a substantial proportion of coal being used by power
stations for electricity generation, NCB sales of coal to them totalled 87-4 million
tonnes in 1985-86. Exports of coal in 1985-86 were 3-3 million tonnes, while
imports amounted to 12-1 million tonnes.
In 1985—86 the NCB spent £57 million on research. It has two main research
establishments: the Mining Research and Development Establishment at
Stanhope Bretby (Staffordshire), for work on mining methods and equipment,
particularly improving the performance and reliability of equipment and
developing systems for remote and automatic control: and the Coal Research
Establishment at Stoke Orchard (near Cheltenham), concerned with the
utilisation of coal, including a major research and development programme on
fluidised bed combustion for industrial steam-raising and heating. This project
has led to successful commercial exploitation, and development work continues.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the NCB
with several countries. Britain is responsible through an NCB subsidiary for the
management of a service which provides information on and analyses of coal
topics under the auspices of the International Energy Agency.
The first public supply of electricity in the world was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and 1957)
effected a measure of decentralisation and established the present structure of
public corporations. Electricity from the public supply system is available to all
premises in Britain except for some very remote rural households. The public
supply industry employed about 150,000 people and invested some £1,700
million in 1985-86. The main transmission system (national grid) in Great
Britain is one of the largest fully interconnected power networks in the Western
world.
The Energy Act 1983 allows private generation to compete with the public
supply industry. It entitles private generators of electricity to sell their electricity
to the boards on terms reflecting costs fairly incurred by the boards, and allows
them to use the public transmission and distribution system.
The Electricity Council is the central co-ordinating body of the supply industry
in England and Wales. It has a general responsibility for promoting the
development and maintenance of an efficient, co-ordinated and economical
system of electricity supply. Electricity is generated and transmitted by the
Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the
operation and maintenance of power stations and the national grid. Twelve area
electricity boards are responsible for distribution and for the retail sale of

electricity. In 1985—86 the income of the electricity supply industry in England
and Wales was £10,742 million.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separating
their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth
of Tay (see map, p 284). In 1985-86 the turnover of the SSEB and the NSHEB
was £887 million and £311 million respectively.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried out
by the publicly owned Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
Sales of electricity in 1985 amounted to 240,387 gigawatt hours (GWh).
Domestic users took 37 per cent of the total, industry 36 per cent and
commercial and other users the remainder. About one-fifth of domestic sales is
for space heating, one-sixth for water heating and one-tenth for cooking.
Electricity is used in industry mainly for motive power, melting, heating and
lighting. It is supplied to 24-3 million consumers of whom 21-5 million are in
England and Wales, 1-7 million are supplied by the SSEB, 578,000 by the
NSHEB and 566,000 are in Northern Ireland.
Generation by the public supply electricity industry in Britain amounted to
279,972 GWh in 1985. Conventional steam power stations provided over 77-2
per cent of the total, nuclear stations 20-1 per cent and gas turbine,
hydro-electric and diesel plant 2-6 per cent. Public supply power stations
consumed 115 million tonnes of coal equivalent in 1985, of which coal
accounted for 65 per cent and oil 16 per cent. The output capacity of the 172
generating stations of the electricity boards at the end of 1985 totalled 63,794
megawatts (MW) including 52,021 MW run by the CEGB, 6,230 MW by the
SSEB, 3,213 MW by the NSHEB and 2,290 MW by the Northern Ireland
Electricity Service. An analysis of electricity generation by and output capacity of
the public supply system is given in Table 22.

Electricity generated less electricity used at power stations (including electricity used for pumping at
pumped-storage stations).
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
(17,583 GWh in 1985). The major sources outside the fuel industries are the

chemicals, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and
British Nuclear Fuels pic. In 1985 these nuclear plants supplied 4,073 GWh of
electricity to the public supply system.
The most recent large-scale power stations are based on units of 500 MW and
660 MW. Station capacities have increased and there are 15 stations each with a
capacity of 2,000 MW or more including Kingsnorth (Kent), Europe’s largest
mixed-fuel station burning either coal or oil. The Drax coal-fired station (North
Yorkshire), which has an output capacity of 4,000 MW, is the largest coal-fired
station in Western Europe. The larger units have a higher thermal efficiency (the
ratio of the net electrical energy output to the heat energy input) than earlier
units and their introduction, coupled with the closure of less efficient plant, has
resulted in a gradual rise in overall thermal efficiency, leading to substantial
savings in fuel consumption. Average thermal efficiency of conventional steam
stations in England and Wales rose from 20-91 per cent in 1947-48 to 34-65 per
cent in 1985—86.
The pumped-storage station at Dinorwig (Gwynedd), the largest of its type in
Europe, has an average generated output of 1,680 MW. (In pumped-storage
schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to
high-level reservoirs from which it descends to drive turbines, rapidly providing
a large supply of electricity at peak periods or to meet sudden increases in
demand.)
The CEGB, together with Electricite de France, has constructed a 2,000-MW
cross-Channel cable link, increasing the capacity for the transmission of
electricity between the two countries. The first stage of the link began operating
in January 1986, and the entire network will be operational by November 1986.
The Government is keen to encourage combined heat and power (CHP)
schemes. As part of a programme to study the potential for CHP/district heating
in particular locations in Britain, the Government has given financial assistance
to consortia from Belfast, Edinburgh and Leicester for the preparation of a
prospectus for a combined CHP/district heating scheme. It is expected that all of
these studies will be completed by the end of 1987.
Britain has been developing nuclear power for several decades and in 1956 the
world's first large-scale nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to
supply electricity to the national grid. The Government believes that nuclear
power has a vital role in helping to meet Britain's long-term energy require¬
ments. There are 14 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the
electricity authorities. Four other stations also feed electricity to the national
grid: the two original Magnox stations (both with a net capacity of about
200 MW) operated by British Nuclear Fuels pic at Calder Hall and Chapelcross
(Dumfries and Galloway); and two experimental or prototype stations run by the
UKAEA—at Winfrith (Dorset) and a prototype fast reactor at Dounreay (High¬
land).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total gross
capacity of about 4,000 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971, the
largest being Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a capacity of 840 MW. The second
series of orders was based on the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR). Hinkley
Point B (Somerset) and Hunterston B (Strathclyde) began operating in 1976,
while three more AGRs began operating in 1985: Dungeness B (Kent),
Hartlepool (Cleveland) and Heysham (Lancashire). All the AGRs are 1,320-MW
units except Dungeness B (1,200 MW). Construction is in progress on two
further 1,320-MW AGRs—a second station at Heysham and a station at Torness
(Lothian)—and these should be completed by 1988. The CEGB has also applied

results of a public inquiry (completed in 1985) and to the necessary consents
and safety clearances being obtained.

cycle: uranium conversion, uranium enrichment (through its shareholding in
Urenco Ltd), fuel element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel,
and the manufacture of specialised fuel element components. All of its shares
are held by the Government. The company is organised into four divisions,
covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire); fuel manufac¬
ture at Springfields (Lancashire); reprocessing (operations) at Sellafield (Cum¬
bria) where valuable unused uranium and plutonium are recovered from the
spent fuel; and reprocessing (engineering) at the headquarters at Risley
(Cheshire). There is a large-scale investment programme in progress involving
expenditure of some £3,700 million over the next ten years. The major part of
this expenditure relates to the Sellafield site and comprises the refurbishment of
facilities for treating spent fuel from Magnox power stations, the construction of
a thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) which will take spent fuel from
Britain's AGRs and overseas reactors, and the construction of facilities to
process and package radioactive waste. The remainder of the programme
involves the construction of further centrifuge enrichment plant at Capenhurst,
and refurbishment and construction of new plant at Springfields.
The UKAEA carries out research and development to ensure that nuclear power
is economic, safe and environmentally acceptable. Its work is undertaken by
research establishments at Harwell (Oxfordshire), Risley, Winfrith, Springfields,
Windscale (Cumbria), Dounreay and Culham (Oxfordshire). In addition, safety
research is carried out at the Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth
(Cheshire). Work connected with the development of the fast reactor and its fuel
cycle takes place principally at Dounreay and represents a major programme for
the UKAEA.
Since April 1986 the UKAEA has operated as a trading fund, which allows it to
function on a commercial basis. Under the new arrangements the UKAEA s
research and development work for the Department of Energy is on a
customer-contractor basis. The UKAEA also carries out work for a number of
other customers including the electricity generating boards, British Nuclear
Fuels pic, other government departments and industry.
Co-operation on nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements—such as that
signed in 1984 with Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy
setting out collaboration on the development of the fast reactor—membership of
bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, and through direct
links on research between the UKAEA and equivalent organisations overseas.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), including one on establishing the
feasibility of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion. A major component of
this programme is the Joint European Torus (JET) project at Culham, which
started operating in 1983.
The Government and the nuclear industry give high priority to safety and the
industry has an excellent safety record. Responsibility for safety at nuclear sites
rests with the operators who must protect their workers and the public by
complying with the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, with conditions of
their nuclear site licences under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and by

keeping discharges within the limits and conditions set by authorisations
granted under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960. In England authorisations
are granted jointly by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and in Scotland and Wales by their
respective Secretaries of State. The terms of the authorisations are designed to
ensure that those most exposed to the effects of discharges receive less than the
maximum dose limit recommended by the International Commission on
Radiological Protection. Within the limits, operators of nuclear facilities are
required to keep discharges as low as reasonably achievable and failure to do so
makes them liable to prosecution. Compliance with the legislation is overseen by
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive, by the
Radiochemical Inspectorate of the Department of the Environment and inspec¬
tors from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in England and Wales,
and by the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland.
Britain is playing a major part in international discussions on nuclear safety.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has drawn up an outline programme
which would include the establishment of two international conventions: one on
the reporting and exchange of information on nuclear accidents with possible
transboundary effects, and one on co-ordinated emergency response and
assistance in the event of such an accident.
The Electricity Council draws up a general programme of research, some of it
direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards and some of it in
co-operation with selected industrial research associations and through re¬
search contracts placed with universities and other organisations. Some of the
work is done in collaboration with the two Scottish electricity boards and the
Northern Ireland Electricity Service which contribute towards its cost (£157
million in 1985—86). Collaboration on research between the supply industry and
the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering Research
Steering Committee. The research establishments run by the CEGB comprise
the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood Engineer¬
ing Laboratories on Southampton Water. Research on distribution technology
and electricity utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council Research
Centre at Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
The Department of Energy is supporting research to develop the techniques for
the exploitation of renewable sources of energy and to promote the commercial
use of those technologies which are or are soon expected to become cost-
effective. Renewable energy sources, however, are not expected to make a major
contribution to energy supplies this century, although they may have a greater
role in the twenty-first century. The Department of Energy’s estimate is that
some £13 million was spent in 1985—86 in support of its renewable energy
programme; work is being concentrated on the most promising technologies, for
example, wind energy, passive solar design, wastes as fuel, and geothermal hot
dry rocks.
Wind power constitutes a resource of considerable national significance. The
Department is supporting two major construction projects: a 60 m (200 ft)
diameter horizontal-axis wind turbine generator of 3 MW on Orkney and a new
medium-scale vertical-axis machine of 160 kW at Carmarthen Bay (Dyfed). In
addition, the Department, a private sector company, the Central Electricity
Generating Board and the European Community are collaborating on the
construction of a 1-MW, 55 m (180 ft) diameter, wind turbine at the Board’s site
at Richborough (Kent). Four other medium-size horizontal-axis machines have
recently been brought into operation. Three were built by private sector

companies (two on Orkney and one at Ilfracombe, Devon) and the fourth was
built by the Central Electricity Generating Board at Carmarthen Bay. The
Department of Trade and Industry is supporting, through its National Engineer¬
ing Laboratory at East Kilbride, the development of a test site for small-scale and
medium scale wind turbines at Eaglesham, near Glasgow.
Under its geothermal hot dry rock programme, the Department is investi¬
gating the economic possibilities of extracting heat from rocks at great depth.
Research is mainly carried out by the Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall,
where a project is being conducted to establish the technology for creating a
suitable deep underground heat exchange zone from which the heat could be
withdrawn.
The Department and an industrial consortium have jointly funded a study of
the technical and financial viability of a tidal energy barrage in the Severn
estuary, which would be financed, built and operated by the private sector.
Advanced investigations and site exploration are planned, and studies are also
envisaged on a proposal for a similar energy barrage in the Mersey estuary.
The Department's work on passive solar design has shown that this could
meet a significant proportion of the demand for space heating in buildings, and
the adoption of effective passive design features is being encouraged.
Biofuels offer possibly the largest contribution from the renewable energy
resources in the medium term. The main work of the Department’s programme
is on the demonstration of the various technologies involved.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain's requirements of industrial raw materials is met by
imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important contribution
to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1984 totalled 302 million
tonnes, valued at £1,371 million. The total number of employees in the
extraction industry was 37,000 in 1984. The locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p 290.
Exploring for and exploiting indigenous mineral resources to meet the needs of
industry are being encouraged by the Government to enhance security of
supplies. The British Geological Survey is carrying out a long-term programme
for the Department of Trade and Industry aimed at identifying areas with the
potential for economic extraction of minerals.
The tonnage extracted of some of the main non-fuel minerals produced in
Britain is given in Table 23. In terms of value, production of common sand and
gravel was estimated at £388 million in 1984, limestone and dolomite £343
million, clays £219 million, igneous rock £139 million, sandstone £57 million,
salt £56 million, tin £38 million, potash £35 million, gypsum and anhydrite £16
million, fluorspar £14 million and chalk £13 million. Britain is a major world
producer of several important industrial minerals including china clay, ball clay,
fuller’s earth, celestite and gypsum, and also produces significant amounts of
limestone, dolomite, chalk, fluorspar, potash, salt, industrial sands, fireclay,
common clay and shale, barytes and talc, mostly for home consumption. Small
amounts of diatomite, slate, calcspar, chert and flint, anhydrite and china stone
are also produced. In 1984 the production of metal from non-ferrous ores
totalled 15,800 tonnes, mainly lead mostly from northern England, and zinc and
tin from Cornwall—the Cornish mines at that time satisfying about two-thirds
of Britain’s demand for primary tin. Small amounts of copper and silver were
produced in association with tin and zinc. Planning permission has recently
been granted for a large opencast tungsten mine at Hemerdon (near Plymouth).

Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock (from limestone, igneous rock
and sandstone) as aggregates for use in construction constitutes over half, by
value, of Britain’s output of non-fuel minerals. Britain is the world’s second
largest producer of marine-dredged sand and gravel (15-4 million tonnes in
1984).

Water
Britain’s water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and partly from underground sources by
means of wells, adits and boreholes. Water for public supply in Britain
amounted to about 18,700 megalitres (Ml) a day in 1985 and average daily
supply per head was nearly 330 litres. About 99 per cent of the population in
Great Britain and over 96 per cent in Northern Ireland are connected to the
public water supply system.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption. Since 1983 optional metering for domestic
users has been available throughout England and Wales, and legislation to
permit the introduction of compulsory domestic water metering on a trial basis
is planned.
In England and Wales the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
are jointly responsible for policy in relation to the conservation, augmentation,
distribution and proper use of water resources and provision of water supplies:
the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services; the restoration and
maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters: and the

use of inland waters for navigation and recreation. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible for policy
relating to land drainage, flood protection, sea defence, and the protection and
development of fisheries.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services; the development of
water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution;
sewerage; sewage treatment; river management; land drainage; sea defence;
recreation; and freshwater fisheries. Water authorities’ estimated revenue for
1986—87 is some £2,680 million. Their management boards are appointed by
ministers. However, legislation is planned to privatise the water authorities in
England and Wales, with a view to removing government financial controls,
improving services and involving the public and the workforce more closely in
ownership of the industry. ,
District councils usually act as agents of water authorities for the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of public sewers in their areas.
There are 30 statutory water supply companies, accounting for about one-
quarter of total supplies, which are operating under the Water Act 1973. Special
arrangements govern the relationship of these companies to the water
authorities.
Some 29,000 Ml a day were abstracted in England and Wales in 1984, of which
public water supplies accounted for 16,400 Ml a day. The Central Electricity
Generating Board took some 7,000 Ml a day primarily for cooling in connection
with electricity generation, other industry about 4,000 Ml a day and the
remainder was used in agriculture.
Water authorities have powers to restrict consumption when there are severe
water shortages. Under the Drought Act 1976 they can limit or prohibit the use
of water and, if necessary, restrict domestic water supplies.
In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. In addition, the Central
Scotland Water Development Board is primarily responsible for developing large
water sources and supplying water in bulk to its five constituent member
authorities, the regional councils in central Scotland.
Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
About 803 million cubic metres of water were abstracted in Scotland in 1984 for
public water supplies. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for
the promotion of the conservation of water resources and the provision by
water authorities of adequate water supplies, and also has a duty to promote
the cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters and the tidal waters of
Scotland.
The Water Service of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland is
responsible for water supply and sewerage throughout Northern Ireland. The
Department is also responsible for the conservation, cleanliness and planned
development of Northern Ireland’s water resources. Northern Ireland has
abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic and industrial use. An
average of 691 Ml of water a day was supplied in 1985.
Investment is taking place to ensure that there is an adequate water supply to
meet future demand. Recent projects have included the Kielder Reservoir in
Northumberland, officially opened in 1985, one of the largest man-made

reservoirs in Europe. The Thames Water Authority is constructing an 80-km
(50-mile) distribution system to meet the growing demand for water in London.
When completed in 1994, it will be the largest urban distribution system in the
world. In 1985—86 capital expenditure on water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal amounted to some £810 million in England and Wales, £97 million in
Scotland and £27 million in Northern Ireland.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the Water
Research Centre. Its membership includes water undertakings, consulting
engineers, manufacturers and overseas organisations. It has three laboratories:
at Stevenage (Hertfordshire), which deals with water and waste water treatment;
at Medmenham (Buckinghamshire), which is concerned with environmental
protection (including water quality and pollution); and at Swindon (Wiltshire),
which is concerned with instrumentation, water mains and sewers. Other
organisations conducting research include Hydraulics Research Limited, uni¬
versities, the Meteorological Office and the Natural Environment Research
Council.

Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level of efficiency and productivity.
Employing less than 3 per cent of the working population, the industry produces
nearly two-thirds of Britain's food requirements compared with just under a half
in 1960, and four-fifths of that which can be grown in a temperate climate
compared with nearly two-thirds in 1960. The food share of Britain’s total
imports has fallen from about a quarter in the 1960s to around 10 per cent in
1985. Gross output in 1985 was £11,883 million, about 4 per cent of gross
domestic product. Britain is also a major exporter of agricultural produce and
food products, agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
The Government aims to foster an efficient and competitive agriculture
industry through the provision and sponsorship of research, development and
advisory services, the provision of financial support where appropriate,
measures to control disease, pests and pollution, and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It also encourages the industry to
adopt high standards on animal welfare. Legislation proposed in 1986 would
give agriculture ministers a responsibility to achieve a balance between the
interests of agriculture, the economic and social interests of rural areas,
conservation and recreation.
Land Use Just over three-quarters of the land area is used for agriculture, the rest being
mountain, forest or put to urban and other uses. The area of agricultural land
has been declining, although there has been a net reduction in the rate of loss in
recent years. There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and
grass. In hill country, where the area of cultivated land is often small, some 6
million hectares (over 15 million acres) are also used for rough grazing. Soils
vary from the thin poor ones of highland Britain to the rich fertile soils of
low-lying areas such as the fenlands of eastern England. The cool temperate
climate and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season;
streams rarely dry up and grassland is green throughout the year.
Farming The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses of 250
standard man-days1 or more is 125 hectares (300 acres). In 1985 there were
some 240,000 farm holdings in Britain and it is estimated that some 90 per cent
of total output came from full-time businesses capable of providing full-time
employment for at least one person and that these represent just under half the
total number of holdings. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days or
more, although accounting for only 12 per cent of holdings, provided about half

the total output. In Wales and Northern Ireland, output from smaller farms is
more significant than in the rest of Britain.
In England, Scotland and Wales, 70 per cent of holdings are wholly or mainly
owner-occupied. Virtually all the farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied.
The number of people engaged in agriculture is just over 690,000. The labour
force continues to decline slightly, and the level of mechanisation to increase.
Labour productivity rose by 69 per cent between 1975 and 1985. Investment has
increased the level of capital per person employed in the industry which is now
about the same as in manufacturing industry compared with 80 per cent in
1960. Total farming income in 1985 was an estimated £1,154 million.
There are about 365,000 tractors and some 55,000 combine harvesters in use.
A wide variety of other machines for harvesting and preservation of grass are
also employed. Horticultural crops such as blackcurrants and brussels sprouts
are frequently harvested by machine, and milking machines are used on the vast
majority of dairy farms. The majority of farms have a direct electricity supply, the
remainder having their own generators.
Although dairy herd monitoring and account analysis have been computer¬
ised for many years, the recent introduction of the microcomputer has produced
major changes in farm business management. Budgeting and the monitoring of
cash-flow and performance are now frequently computerised, while computer
models of typical farms allow a wide range of crops and livestock to be
considered, along with demands for labour, land, capital and buildings. The
Government provides a topical information service to farmers and growers
through the Prestel viewdata service.
Home production of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight of
total supplies (that is, output plus imports minus exports) in Table 24.

About three-fifths of full-time farms are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle
and sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle are reared in the hill and moorland
areas of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening occurs partly in better grassland areas, as does
dairying, and partly on arable farms. British livestock breeders have developed
many of the cattle, sheep and pig breeds with world-wide reputations, for
example, the Hereford and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey
and Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Because of developments in artificial insemination and embryo transfer, Britain
is able to export semen and embryos from high-quality donor animals.
Table 25 shows the number of livestock and output of livestock products.

Most dairy cattle in England and Wales and a significant proportion in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are bred by artificial insemination. The average size of
dairy herds in Britain was 58 in 1985 while the average yield of milk per dairy
cow has increased from 3,406 litres (748 gallons) in 1965 to 4,748 litres (1,044
gallons) in 1985, a rise of 42 per cent. Average household consumption of liquid
milk per head in 1985 was 1-9 litres (3-3 pints) per week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is predominant. The remainder is derived
from suckler herds producing high-quality beef calves in the hills and uplands,
where the traditional British beef breeds, such as Hereford and Aberdeen Angus,
continue to be important. Imported breeds which have established themselves
include the Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian Blue.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between them. Research has provided vaccine and serum
protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases. Although lamb production is
the main source of income for sheep farmers, wool is also important.
Grass supplies 60 to 80 per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep; grass
production has been enhanced by the increased use of fertilisers, irrigation and
methods of grazing control, and improved herbage conservation for winter feed.
Rough grazings are used for extensively grazed sheep and cattle, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.

Pig production occurs in most areas but is particularly important in eastern and
northern England. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units
and larger herds. Artificial insemination is available throughout Britain.
Output of poultry meat and eggs has continued to benefit from better
husbandry and genetic improvements. Since 1975 poultry meat production has
increased by almost a third and reached about 874,000 tonnes in 1985.
Production of broilers from holdings of over 100,000 birds accounts for just over
a half of total production. In 1985, egg production was over 1,000 million dozen.
About two-thirds of laying birds are in flocks of 20,000 or more. Britain remains
broadly self-sufficient in poultry meat and eggs.
It is an offence to cause unnecessary pain or distress to livestock on commercial
farms. Regulations control such operations as castration and tail docking, and

require owners of intensive units to arrange for the daily inspection of their
stock and the equipment on which it depends. There are advisory codes and
recommendations for the welfare of all major species of farm animals and
compliance with them is monitored by the State Veterinary Service. The welfare
of farm animals is also protected by regulations.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council, an independent body set up by the
Government, keeps under review the welfare of farm animals on agricultural
land, at markets, in transit and at the place of slaughter.
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found mainly in eastern
and central southern England and eastern Scotland. Large-scale potato and
vegetable production is undertaken in the fens (in Cambridgeshire and south
Lincolnshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the
peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in
south-west Wales, Kent and south-west England. High-grade seed potatoes are

About a quarter of the wheat crop is normally used for flour milling, and about
one-third for animal feed. Between 15 and 20 per cent of the barley crop is used

for malting and distilling and about half for animal feed. Exports of wheat and
barley have increased substantially, accounting in recent years for about a
quarter of total production. There has been a rapid increase in the oilseed rape
crop; the seed is crushed to obtain vegetable oil and the solid matter left is used
for animal feed.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides about 50 per cent of requirements,
most of the remainder being refined from raw sugar imported from developing
countries under the Lome Convention.
In 1985 the land utilised for horticulture was about 226,000 hectares (559,000
acres), of which vegetables grown in the open (excluding potatoes) accounted for
157,450 hectares (389,070 acres), orchards for 38,400 hectares (95,100 acres),
small fruit for 15,940 hectares (39,400 acres), bulbs and flowers grown in the
open for 5,180 hectares (12,800 acres) and hardy nursery stock for 7,090
hectares (17,520 acres). Crops grown in glasshouses accounted for 2,230
hectares (5,510 acres).
Field vegetables account for just over 40 per cent of the value of horticultural
output and are widely grown throughout the country. Most horticultural
enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of improved
planting material, new techniques and the widespread use of machinery. Some
field vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks of compressed peat or
loose-filled cells, a technique which reduces root damage and allows plants to
establish themselves more reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, flowers, pot
plants and nursery stock. Widespread use is being made of automatic control of
heating and ventilation, and semi-automatic control of watering. Energy-
efficient glasshouses use thermal screens and other methods, while low-cost
plastic tunnels extend the season for certain crops previously grown in the open.
Under the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (see p 300), a
wide range of horticultural produce is subject to common quality standards.
The Government is keen to encourage the growth of exports related to
agriculture and their value is increasing in real terms; they amounted to £5,759
million in 1985, of which exports of food and drink accounted for £4,728
million, with the main markets being Western Europe, North America and the
Middle East. Exports include speciality products such as fresh salmon, Scotch
whisky, biscuits, jams and conserves, as well as beef and lamb carcasses and
cheese. Food from Britain, a national marketing organisation responsible for
improving the marketing of British produce in the domestic and overseas
markets, was set up in 1983. The British Food Export Council represents its
export arm for fresh and processed food and drink, and identifies suppliers for
customers, organises programmes of visits and meetings for overseas custom¬
ers, and, with the British Overseas Trade Board, co-ordinates British pavilions
at the world's major agricultural exhibitions. The British Agricultural Export
Council provides a similar service for the agricultural and horticultural supply
industries; products and services offered by its members include all types of
machinery, seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, feedingstuffs, livestock and semen,
veterinary preparations and equipment, and consultancy. In 1985, Britain
exported over 90,000 wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, maintaining its
position as the world's largest exporter.
One of the world’s largest agricultural events, the annual Royal International
Agricultural Show, held at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, provides an opportunity
for overseas visitors to see what British agriculture has to offer. A typical
attendance for the four open days is 200,000 including 16,000 from overseas.

ROLE OF THE
GOVERNMENT
Common

Policy
Virtually every British agricultural machinery manufacturer is represented at
the show, which is also the most important pedigree livestock event in the
country. The show's specialised sections cover livestock improvement, farm
mechanisation including working demonstrations of agricultural equipment,
electronics, arable cropping, horticulture, forestry, new technology and re¬
search, tropical agricultural applications and a food hall. Other major agricul¬
tural displays include the annual Royal Smithfield Show, held in London, which
exhibits agricultural machinery, livestock and carcasses, and the annual Royal
Highland Show, held in June at Ingliston near Edinburgh. There are also several
important regional shows.
Agricultural products are marketed by private traders, producers’ co-operatives
and marketing boards, the latter being producers' organisations (each including
a minority of independent members appointed by agriculture ministers) with
certain statutory powers to regulate the marketing of milk, wool and potatoes.
For the most part the boards buy from producers or control contracts between
first buyers; the Potato Marketing Board, however, maintains only a broad
control over marketing conditions leaving producers free to deal individually
with buyers. For home-grown cereals, meat and livestock, apples and pears,
there are marketing organisations representing producer, distributor and
independent interests.
Food from Britain is responsible for improving the marketing of food and
agricultural products, both in the domestic market and abroad. It has
introduced a ‘foodmark’ symbol under which producers are able to guarantee
the quality of fresh and lightly processed foods to the consumer.
Substantial investment—£80 million in new fixed assets in 1975—85—is being
made by agricultural and horticultural co-operatives concerned with marketing
and storing products. A number of central co-operative grain stores have been
established, and new vegetable groups have been formed to meet the demand
from retailers for a continuous supply of fresh, quality produce; fruit marketing
co-operatives are also expanding. Food from Britain provides a full range of
advisory services for co-operatives and the Government assists their develop¬
ment with grants.
Four government departments have joint responsibility—the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland, the Welsh Office and the Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland.
The stated aims of the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy,
which accounts for about two-thirds of the Community’s budget, are to increase
agricultural productivity and thereby to ensure that the agricultural community
has a fair standard of living, to stabilise the agricultural market, to guarantee
regular supplies of food and to provide these supplies at a reasonable price.
Decisions on the level of price support are taken annually by the Council of
Ministers on the basis of proposals presented by the European Commission. For
many commodities these measures consist of a minimum intervention price at
which agencies of the member states will purchase production, thereby putting
a floor in the market, and levies made on imports to maintain internal support
prices. Schemes may be introduced for subsidised disposal of stocks to
consumers within the Community where this can be done without disrupting
internal markets. The export of surpluses is facilitated by the provision of export
refunds to enable Community exporters to sell on world markets at the going
price. There is also provision for certain direct payments, including beef and
sheepmeat premiums, to producers.

The support prices, as well as rates of levy, export refunds and other aids, are
set in European Currency Units and are converted into the currencies of the
member states at fixed rates of exchange (commonly called ‘green rates’) which
do not vary automatically in line with changes in market exchange rates. The
green rates can thus be out of line with the market rate of exchange between
each currency and the European Currency Unit, giving rise to different real
support price levels in the different member states. Monetary compensatory
amounts, based on the percentage difference between the green and market
rates of each currency, are applied to prevent distortions in trade. They operate
as import subsidies and export levies for countries whose currencies’ market
rates are below the green rates, and as import levies and export subsidies in the
opposite case.
In order to reduce the costs of the agricultural policy, the British Government
has sought to obtain improvements in its operations, in particular by bringing
support prices more into line with the realities of the market and by containing
the costs of the policy. In recent years tougher prices have been agreed, but the
Government considers that measures to rationalise the policy further are
necessary.
The Community’s agricultural expenditure is channelled through the Euro¬
pean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund's guarantee section
finances market support arrangements, while the guidance section provides
funds for structural reform, for example, farm modernisation and investment,
and payments to assist certain farmers to change to alternative enterprises.
Expenditures in Britain in 1985—86 on price guarantees, grants and subsidies
and on Common Agricultural Policy market regulations were estimated to be
£320 million and £1,890 million respectively. About £1,310 million was
reimbursed from the Community budget.
Potatoes and wool are not covered by the Common Agricultural Policy; price
guarantees for potatoes are operated through the Potato Marketing Board and
the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, and a price stabilisation
fund for wool is administered by the British Wool Marketing Board.
Producers also receive support through certain capital and production grants,
some based on Community decisions. Grants are available to assist farmers and
horticulturists with farm improvement plans, and there is special financial help
for hill and upland farmers in the form of headage payments on cattle and sheep
(known as compensatory allowances). Community assistance may also be made
to help to improve facilities for the marketing and processing of agricultural
products and to provide a premium payment to specialised beef producers, while
launching aid is available to production and marketing groups in the
horticultural sector.
Local authorities provide some 6,570 statutory smallholdings in England and
964 in Wales. They make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to
their tenants. Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the
Government, which, while now seeking to dispose of holdings to sitting tenants,
still owns and maintains about 121,000 hectares (299,000 acres) of land
settlement estates, comprising some 1,610 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (in Strathclyde, Highland, Western Isles,
Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands) much of the land is held by tenants known
as crofters. Crofting is administered by the Crofters Commission, and benefits
from government grants for land improvements and some other agricultural
work.
The agricultural holdings legislation protects the interests and rights of
landlords and tenants. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and

tenant and may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
Most agricultural tenants have the right to contest a notice to quit, which is
then ineffective unless the landlord obtains consent to its operation from an
independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in
Scotland the Scottish Land Court). On termination of tenancy, the tenant is
entitled to compensation in accordance with a special code. There are provisions
for succession of a close relative on the death of a tenant but this does not apply
in England and Wales to new tenancies coming into effect on or after 12 July
1984.
Practically all farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied, but, under a
system known as ‘conacre’, farmers not wishing to farm all their land let it
annually to others. About one-fifth of agricultural land is so let, and is used
mainly for grazing.
Agriculture ministers have a general duty to have regard to the desirability of
conserving the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside, and a specific
duty to further conservation in exercising certain of their functions relating to
capital grants for farms in areas designated as national parks or sites of special
scientific interest or in the Norfolk Broads. Under proposed legislation
agriculture ministers will have a new duty to try to achieve a reasonable balance
between the interrelated needs of the countryside: agriculture, social and
economic needs, conservation and recreation. In England and Wales the
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (see below) advises farmers on,
and actively promotes, aspects of conservation such as wildlife habitats,
landscape features and farm buildings, and encourages the industry to adopt
high standards of pollution control. In addition, research programmes include
studies on the ecological impact of pesticides and on biological methods of pest
control and other aspects of environmental protection. A countrywide survey of
environmental data on farms was initiated in April 1985, and in February 1986
an initiative was launched to improve the rural environment and provide
opportunities for long-term unemployed people in the rural areas of England,
with a parallel one planned for Wales. Representatives of farming and
conservation interests have developed a network of farming and wildlife advisory
groups to provide a forum for integrating agriculture and conservation.
The Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive is responsible
for enforcing regulations relating to the health and safety of workers in
agriculture. These cover such matters as the guarding of field and stationary
machinery, workplaces, the fitting of safety cabs to tractors, and the use of
chemicals.
In England and Wales the Government's Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) provides a wide range of professional, scientific, technical and
veterinary services for agriculture and its ancillary industries. Some of the
services are free but others are charged for. Similar services are provided in
Scotland by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and three regional
agricultural colleges and a section of the State Veterinary Service, which, in
England and Wales, is a constituent part of ADAS. In Northern Ireland these
services are available from the Department of Agriculture’s advisory service and
specialist divisions, together with agricultural colleges.
ADAS provides information and advice to farmers and growers on such
matters as dairy husbandry, livestock, horticulture, farm management, mecha¬
nisation and agronomy. It identifies problems requiring further investigation
and carries out the necessary research and development. It also advises the
Government on the scientific, technical and business implications of policy

proposals and assists in implementing policies concerning animal and plant
health, disease and pest eradication, land drainage and other capital grant
schemes, and safeguarding agricultural land in relation to other land uses. The
Service runs 19 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations, six
agricultural science laboratories with three sub-centres, one veterinary labora¬
tory and 19 veterinary investigation centres.
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has endorsed the conclusions
of a 1984 review which recommended that ADAS should concentrate more of its
research and development activities on development, be committed to the use of
computer-based information technology as a means of providing information
and advice to the industry, and give more emphasis to conservation and animal
welfare work; and that the industry should contribute more to the cost of the
advisory and other services from which it benefits.
England, Scotland and Wales are free from many serious animal diseases. If they
were to occur, diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular
disease would be combated by a slaughter policy applied to all infected animals
and those exposed to infection, and by control over animal movements during
the outbreaks. Rigorous measures are being taken to eradicate sheep scab and
warble fly. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis is very low; cattle (except for
certain categories) are tested at regular intervals, and reactors to the test are
slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Because of compulsory
measures to eradicate brucellosis, begun on an area basis in 1972, England and
Wales were declared free of the disease for all practical purposes in 1981,
following a similar declaration for Scotland in 1980. In September 1984
vaccination replaced slaughter as the means of controlling Newcastle disease in
poultry.
Strict controls are exercised on the import of animals, meat and meat
products, live poultry and other captive birds, and poultry meat, so as to prevent
the introduction of animal or poultry diseases. Special measures apply to
prevent the introduction of rabies, and most animals are subject to import
licence and six months’ quarantine; exceptions to this rule include such farm
animals as pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. There are severe penalties for breaking
the law. There have been no cases of rabies outside quarantine in Britain since
1970.
Northern Ireland has been kept free from the major animal diseases, including
rabies, foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular disease, and in 1982 the
incidence of brucellosis was reduced to the point where the country was officially
declared brucellosis-free.
Professional advice and action on the control of animal disease and the welfare
of farm livestock is the responsibility of the government veterinary services,
which have laboratory facilities and investigation centres performing specialist
research work and advising private practitioners responsible for treating
animals on the farm.
The agricultural departments are responsible for limiting the spread of plant
pests and diseases and for preventing the introduction of new ones. They also
issue the health certificates required by other countries to accompany plant
material exported from Britain. Certification schemes are operated to encourage
the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks.
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 has given the Government
powers to control the supply and use of pesticides in Britain, these replacing the
previous non-statutory arrangement under the Pesticide Safety Precautions
Scheme. The Act provides for the creation of a statutory scheme for the approval
304

of pesticides on the basis of their safety, efficacy and, where necessary,
humaneness in use. It also provides for controls on the import, sale, supply,
storage, distribution, advertisement and use of pesticides, and for the release of
information to the public about pesticides. Some measures came into force in
1985; others followed in 1986.
The manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products is prohibited
except under licence. Licences are issued by the agriculture ministers, who are
advised on safety, quality and efficacy by the Veterinary Products Committee
comprising independent experts.
The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), the Government and
private industry are responsible for the research effort. There is a network of
institutes financed by the Council and seven Scottish agricultural research
institutes supported by the Department of Agriculthre and Fisheries and
advised by the Council. Known as the Agricultural and Food Research Service,
this network currently conducts work valued at about £130 million annually.
The Council, an autonomous body, receives funds from the science budget,
through the Department of Education and Science, and income from work
commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Some funds
are also received from industry and other outside bodies. The Council supervises
research carried out at a number of sites throughout Britain. Following a review
in 1985 the Council is drawing its existing research stations together
administratively into eight institutes to minimise duplication of work and
provide a more efficient management structure. The new institutes are for
research into animal disease, animal physiology and genetics, grassland and
animal production, arable crops, horticulture, plant sciences, food, and
agricultural engineering. Broadly similar areas are covered by the seven Scottish
research institutes controlled by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
but the research is directed particularly to the needs of northern Britain. The
AFRC advises on research at these institutes. Research in Northern Ireland is
carried out by the Department of Agriculture in association with the Queen’s
University of Belfast and is mainly directed towards local problems; three
agricultural colleges also cover applied research in agricultural science and food
technology.
The Council also has a number of units and groups associated with
universities, and through its research grant schemes, supports projects in
universities, polytechnics and colleges.
Genetic manipulation is a high priority in the Council programme and, apart
from contributing to a basic understanding of plant processes at the molecular
level, is applied in a variety of scientific areas, from animal vaccine production to
the development of new plant varieties. Other research within the Council’s
institutes has led to the development of embryo cleavage and transplantation in
commercial animal husbandry, so that animals with desirable characteristics
can be multiplied much more rapidly than by conventional means. Some of the
techniques can also be applied to transport embryos between countries, thereby
avoiding the risk of carrying disease which may occur when live adult farm
animals are moved. An international vaccine bank for emergency control of
foot-and-mouth disease is held at one of the Council’s institutes.
The Government is planning a programme of collaborative research between
industry and public sector research bodies to investigate the uses of biotech¬
nology in the genetic engineering of plants.
Some 80 per cent of the British wheat acreage and about half the potato
acreage are planted with varieties bred by the publicly financed research
programme. Investigations into some naturally occurring insecticides have led

AND

to the development of a completely new class of insecticides, the pyrethroids,
which are used world-wide. A combination of research in plant breeding,
physiology, disease control and improved storage methods has established a
viable dry bulb onion production industry.
University and other degree and postgraduate courses provide training in the
scientific and technological aspects of agriculture and horticulture, the empha¬
sis being on science and economics. There are also degree and postgraduate
courses in veterinary medicine. Science-based sandwich courses, leading to a
Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC) Higher National Diploma and
available at agricultural colleges, are designed for students wishing to enter
farming or horticulture with a good knowledge of the managerial and
technological aspects of the industry. The three-year BTEC National Diploma,
also organised on a sandwich basis, is a general course in agriculture with some
colleges offering special subjects such as arable farming, livestock production,
dairy farming and farm mechanisation. Both diploma courses, validated by the
BTEC, normally require 12 months' previous practical experience. In addition,
there are one-year full-time National Certificate courses providing a basic
education in agriculture or horticulture, and a one- or two-year part-time
practical course in the basic principles of agriculture, horticulture or forestry
followed by more specialised study. In Scotland new and restructured courses
have replaced the Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board runs the Agricultural and
Horticultural Training Scheme, which can lead to the issue of craft certificates
or to a full apprenticeship. The scheme is flexible to allow mature workers to
participate as well as young people entering agriculture and horticulture
through youth training schemes. In Northern Ireland agricultural training
courses are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture.
Fisheries
Britain is one of Europe’s most important fishing nations. The fishing industry
provides about 66 per cent of British fish supplies, and is an important source of
employment and income in a number of ports. In 1985 there were 16,150
fishermen in regular employment and nearly 5,800 occasionally employed. The
Government aims to encourage the development of a viable, efficient and
market-orientated fisheries industry within the framework of the European
Community’s Common Fisheries Policy. The main concerns of government
fisheries policy are conservation and exploitation of sea fish stocks, financial
support for fleet modernisation and other measures, the improvement of the
industry’s technical and economic performance, the development of a viable fish
farming industry, and protection of the aquatic environment.
In 1985 demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea) accounted for
about 53 per cent by weight of total British landings, pelagic fish (caught near
the surface) for 37 per cent and shellfish for 10 per cent. Landings of all types of
fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British fishing vessels totalled 760,000
tonnes. Cod and haddock each represented about 27 per cent of the total value of
demersal and pelagic fish landed, while whiting (7 per cent), mackerel (7 per
cent) and plaice (5 per cent) were the other most important sources of earnings
to the industry.
The British fish farming industry is a substantial and expanding business
mainly concerned with the production of salmon and trout although shellfish
and eel farming are growing. Estimated production in 1985 was 12,000 tonnes
of trout and 7,000 tonnes of salmon.

Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and canned fish and shellfish in 1985 totalled
385,000 tonnes, those of fish meal 236,000 tonnes and those of fish oils
265,000 tonnes. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products amounted to
304,000 tonnes. Following a British initiative, member states of the European
Community banned from January 1982 the import of primary whale products in
order to help to conserve whale populations.
Some 64 per cent of the British catch is taken by the 7,367 vessels of the inshore
fleet employing a variety of catching methods. The deep-sea fleet, comprising
217 larger vessels, has been reduced in number as fishing opportunities and the
profitability of operations in distant waters have declined.
The fisheries departments are responsible for the administration of legislation
concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under legislation administered by the Department of
Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority provides financial aid for the purchase of new
fishing vessels, vessel improvements, the provision and improvement of
processing plants, cold stores and ice plants and towards the formation of
fishermen's co-operatives. Other functions include research and development,
training, dissemination of information, publicity and promotion.
Community countries, and certain non-Community countries having fishery
agreements with the Community, may fish up to Britain’s 12-mile limit.
Designated countries may also fish in specified areas of Britain’s 6-to-12-mile
zone. No foreign vessels may fish within Britain's 6-mile limit.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles in the mid-1970s, new
arrangements became necessary to control Community fishing in the greatly
extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest in such control, since a
sizeable proportion of the total catch within the 200-mile limits of member
states is taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in
distant waters (such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry’s total catch
more than that of other Community states.
In January 1983 member states reached an agreement on a common fisheries
policy providing for new arrangements on access to coastal waters applicable for
a period of at least 20 years. Its other features include a revised marketing
regime, regulations covering technical conservation measures such as mesh
sizes for nets, the allocation of catch quotas among member states within each
year's total allowable catch, effective enforcement of the rules and financial aid to
promote the adaptation and development of the Community fishing fleet and the
fish farming industry.
Fishery relations between the European Community and other countries are
governed by long-term framework agreements. Reciprocal agreements are in
force with Norway, the Faroe Islands and Sweden. Non-reciprocal agreements
are in force with Canada, the United States, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea,
Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe and the Seychelles. Quotas have also
been established in international waters in the north-west Atlantic.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a research directorate
comprising laboratories dealing with marine and freshwater fisheries, shellfish,
marine pollution, fish farming and diseases. Work on the utilisation of fish is
undertaken by a research station at Torry, Aberdeen. There are also two

seagoing research vessels. In Scotland the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries maintains laboratories on marine and freshwater fisheries research as
well as three seagoing vessels. The two research programmes are co-ordinated.
Department of Agriculture laboratories in Northern Ireland monitor marine and
freshwater fisheries.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in waters outside a limit of six miles from the coasts of the
British Isles. In Scotland, salmon fishing is a private right. In England and
Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary netting.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 21 million hectares (5-2 million acres) in Great
Britain: about 7-3 per cent of England. 12-6 per cent of Scotland and 11-6 per
cent of Wales. The Government supports the continued expansion of forestry in
order to reduce dependence on imports of timber and to provide employment in
forestry and related industries.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain is 2 million hectares (4 -9 million
acres), 44 per cent of which is managed by the Forestry Commission and the
rest by private owners. The rate of new planting in 1985 was 5,200 hectares
(12,800 acres) by the Commission and some 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres)
by private woodland owners mainly in Scotland. Most planting is of conifers
in upland areas though the planting of broadleaved trees is encouraged on
suitable sites. An increasing proportion of new planting is being done by private
owners.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at about 17,000 in 1985, with a further 8,000 people engaged in processing
home-grown timber.
British woodlands meet only 10 per cent of the nation’s consumption of wood
and wood products. At present only just over half of the Commission’s
woodlands are in production. Home timber production, however, is expected to
double over the next 20 years.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority in Great Britain. The
Commissioners give advice on forestry matters and are responsible to the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland and Wales. In pursuing timber production, forestry policy also takes
into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria, and the
Commission’s activities include wildlife conservation, the landscaping of
plantations and the provision of facilities for recreation. The Commission has
also encouraged the setting up of new timber-using industries.
The Government has asked the Commission to sell some of its land and
plantations in order to rationalise its holdings with a view to improving the
Commission's efficiency and the commercial effectiveness of the forestry
enterprise. Holdings have been reduced by 83,000 hectares (205,000 acres) as a
result of sales. The Commission is financed partly by the Government and partly
by receipts from sales of timber and other produce and from rents.
A substantial number of private woods are in ownerships of under 100 hectares
(250 acres) in extent. The Government encourages private forestry through
appropriate tax reliefs. There is also a forestry grant scheme under which the
Commission aids planting by private owners. A special scheme encourages the
planting of broadleaved trees by the payment of higher levels of grant.

Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at three
universities and there are supervisory, craft and managerial level courses. The
Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists the
development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in the state
and private sectors. The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is
concerned with training for private sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Commission at two research stations.
Aid is also given for research work in universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute in Oxford.
The Department of Agriculture may acquire land for afforestation and give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. Financial provision is
made annually by Parliament.
The state forest area has grown steadily since 1945. By 1985, 73,000 hectares
(180,000 acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of which 56,000 hectares
(138,000 acres) were planted. There were about 13,500 hectares (33,000 acres)
of privately owned forest. Some 400 people work in state forests.
15 Transport and
Communications
ROADS
Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight have resulted
from the construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city
rail services (such as those operated by high-speed trains), the modernisation of
many ports, the use by airlines of more efficient and quieter aircraft, and
expansion schemes at many airports. The Channel Tunnel, on which construc¬
tion work could begin in 1987, is expected to have a significant impact on travel
between Britain and the continent of Europe. Communications are benefiting
from developments in microelectronics, computer and satellite technology, and
advances in materials, for example, the application of optical fibres in
telecommunications.
Transport policy rests on the fundamental aims of promoting economic
growth and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of
personal mobility, while improving safety (particularly on the roads), minimis¬
ing damage to the environment and using energy economically. Britain is taking
an active part in the development of a common transport policy by the European
Community, this being seen as essential for the application of the Treaty of
Rome’s competition rules and the development of the Community’s internal
market. While major sectors of transport and communications operations are
publicly owned, the Government is arranging for the introduction of private
capital into a number of them as part of its policy of reducing state involvement
as much as possible. This is also part of the Government’s wider aim of
increasing competition, so ensuring value for money, in transport services, both
within Britain and internationally. Measures to increase competition are being
taken in a number of sectors such as the bus industry and airline services.
Inland Transport
Passenger and freight traffic is carried mainly by road. At the end of 1985 there
were 21-2 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great Britain, of
which 18-2 million were private cars and light goods vehicles, 0-6 million other
goods vehicles, 11 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds, and 120,000
public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of cars has
been growing rapidly for many years and the car is the most popular form of
transport, with car and taxi travel accounting for some 82 per cent of passenger
mileage within Great Britain. Buses and coaches account for about 8 per cent of
passenger mileage, rail for 7 per cent and air 0-6 per cent. Road haulage has a
dominant position in the movement of inland freight, accounting for about 86
per cent of tonnage carried and for over three-fifths of tonne-km. Railways,
inland waterways, coastal shipping and pipelines are important in carrying
certain types of freight, particularly bulk goods.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain is continuing to grow, having risen by 3 per
cent in 1985 to some 284,400 million vehicle-km. Improvements are continually
being made in the network of trunk roads (which form a basic network linking
major centres of population, industrial areas and ports) to accommodate the
growth in traffic. A number of motorways (roads specially designed for
310
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
long-distance traffic) have been built, while other improvements, such as the
construction of bypasses, have helped to make travelling easier and faster,
particularly over long distances and between cities, and have relieved many
towns and villages of heavy through traffic. Although motorways account for less
than 1 per cent of road mileage, they carry nearly 13 per cent of traffic including
16 per cent of heavy goods vehicle traffic. Motorways have attracted a greater
volume of traffic (particularly heavy lorries) than originally expected, necessi¬
tating the structural renewal of a number of the older sections.
In 1985 the road network totalled some 372,016 km (231,160 miles), of which
2,850 km (1,771 miles) were trunk motorways (see Table 27).

a In addition, there were 77 km (48 miles) of local authority motorway in England and 24 km (15 miles) in
Scotland. In April 1986 some 60 km (37 miles) of trunk motorway were under construction in England and 14 km
(9 miles) in Scotland.
The main aims of the Government’s programme to improve trunk roads are to
meet the needs of industry, to keep heavy lorry traffic away from towns and
villages, and to improve road safety. In England particular attention is being
given to improving access to ports on the east and south coasts, and to ensuring
good road access to the planned Channel Tunnel terminal (see p 319). Much of
the London area has benefited from the M25 London orbital route, the final
stage of which will be completed later in 1986. A further crossing of the Thames
is planned at Dartford (Kent) to handle the expected increase in traffic on the
M25 between the north and south banks of the river. In Wales the priorities are
improvements to the coast road in north Wales (including the construction
under the Conwy estuary of a £177 million tunnel, the first immersed tube road
tunnel to be built in Britain) and the upgrading of roads which are important for
industrial redevelopment. Although most of the motorway and dual carriageway
network in central Scotland has been completed, an extension to the southern
end of the M74 is under construction. Other priorities are the improvement of
strategic routes such as those to the north and north-east (which are important
for North Sea oil-related activities), some of the west-coast routes, and the
construction of more bypasses. In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on building
new links to the motorway network, constructing more bypasses, and improving
roads in the Belfast area and other urban areas. Priority for new roads in urban
areas of Great Britain is being given to those designed to meet the needs of
industry and commerce, serve new industrial or housing estates, provide links
to the national trunk road network or to complement traffic management
schemes.

Administration
Road Safety
Responsibility for trunk road motorways and other trunk roads in Great Britain
rests in England with the Secretaiy of State for Transport, in Scotland with the
Secretary of State for Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales.
The costs of construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
government. The highway authorities for non-trunk roads in England are the
county councils, the metropolitan district councils, the London borough
councils and the Common Council of the City of London. In Wales the
authorities are the county councils, and in Scotland the regional or islands
councils. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environ¬
ment is responsible for the construction, improvement and maintenance of
public roads.
Research into all aspects of road construction, traffic engineering and
safety, and into problems associated with transport is carried out by the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory, the research arm of the Department
of Transport.
Britain and the other members of the European Community have promoted
road safety throughout 1986, which the Community designated as European
Road Safety Year. Many conferences and other events were held, and member
states concentrated on a number of major publicity themes, which in Britain
concerned publicity on children and young people, cyclists and motor cyclists,
and drinking and driving. Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a good record on road safety,
experiencing one of the lowest road accident death rates in the Community. In
1985, 5,200 people were killed on the roads, about 71,000 seriously injured and
241,400 slightly injured. A comprehensive framework of legislation summarised
in the Highway Code (which sets out the standard of conduct for road users) has
contributed to the long-term decline in casualty rates. Other factors have been
better road design and construction, segregating vehicles from pedestrians, and
the publicity campaigns conducted nationally by government departments and
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and locally by local authorities
to persuade people to take greater care on the roads. However, the main recent
contributory factor has been the compulsory wearing of seat belts in the front
seats of cars and light vans, which was introduced for a three-year period in
1983; in 1986 the regulations were made permanent. Since the implementation
of compulsory wearing there has been a substantial net reduction in road
casualties, estimated at a minimum of 200 deaths and 7,000 serious injuries a
year. Regulations have been made requiring rear seat belts or child restraints to
be fitted to new cars first registered from 1 April 1987.
Comprehensive regulations govern the design of vehicles, their use on the
roads, and the maintenance and testing of their mechanical condition. Under a
national type approval’ scheme in Great Britain, all new cars must be of a type
that has been certified as meeting the required standards, and there is a similar
scheme for new goods vehicles. Private cars and light vans which are three or
more years old must be tested annually at private garages authorised as test
stations. (In Northern Ireland private cars six or more years old are tested at
official vehicle inspection centres.) Heavy goods vehicles are subject to annual
tests carried out at special testing stations.
Minimum ages are laid down for driving: 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles; 17 for driving cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that of the driver), motor cycles and
goods vehicles not over 3-5 tonnes gross laden weight; 18 for goods vehicles over
3-5 but not over 7-5 tonnes; and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats
and goods vehicles over 7-5 tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles, except new
residents holding certain non-British licences, are required to pass the driving

test before being granted a full licence to drive. Learners must display ‘L' plates
on their vehicle and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a
qualified driver. There are national speed limits of 60 mph (97 km/h) on single
carriageway roads and 70 mph (113 km/h) on dual carriageway roads (including
motorways), unless a lower limit is indicated. In built-up areas there is a general
limit of 30 mph (48 km/h).
Under the Transport Act 1981, breath testing has become the main means of
determining a driver’s alcohol level; the statutory limit of breath alcohol
concentration for drivers is 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
breath. Several measures have been introduced to improve the safety of motor
cyclists, including the restriction of learner drivers to the less powerful
machines, a two-part motor-cycle driving test and a limit on the duration of the
motor-cycle provisional licence.
Traffic management schemes are being operated in, many urban areas to
minimise congestion, create a better environment and improve road safety. They
may include computerised traffic control systems, one-way systems, bus priority
measures, parking controls and limited road construction. Many towns have
shopping precincts which are specially designed for pedestrians and from which
motor vehicles are excluded for all or part of the day. In most town centres
parking is restricted and waiting limits apply. City centres often have controlled
parking zones, where payment is required for on-street parking. An experiment
in central London involving the use of wheel clamps to immobilise illegally
parked vehicles began in 1983 and will continue until 1987 to enable its effects
to be fully assessed.
Urban traffic control systems, with traffic signals controlled by a central
computer, are in operation in 49 cities in Britain. Systems developed by the
Department of Transport and British firms have achieved international repute
and are the most commonly used in the world. The most modern of these
systems, which continuously measures and responds to the flow of traffic, is
already in operation or about to be installed in 25 locations including London,
Coventry, Maidstone, Southampton, Cambridge and Worcester.
Road haulage traffic amounted to 99,100 million tonne-km in 1985. There has
been a move towards larger and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads—about 71 per cent of the traffic, in terms of tonne-km, is carried in
vehicles of over 28 tonnes gross laden weight. Much of the traffic is moved over
short distances, with 76 per cent of the tonnage being carried on hauls of
100 km (62 miles) or less, although the growth in road haulage has been
concentrated on long-distance traffic. Public haulage (private road hauliers
carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for 64 per cent of freight carried in Great
Britain in terms of tonne-km.
The environmental problems caused by lorries have become a matter of public
concern. The Government has introduced a number of measures to bring
economic benefits and increased protection to the environment and the public.
Safeguards on the design of lorries include restrictions on their dimensions,
while a number of measures have been taken to improve the enforcement of lorry
weights and safety. More bypasses are being built to keep lorries away from
residential areas. There is a programme of research and development, involving
vehicle and engine manufacturers, to reduce the noise from heavy lorries to less
than half the 1981 level and produce a quiet heavy vehicle for the 1990s. To
encourage the use of railways and inland waterways for the carriage of freight,
grants of up to 60 per cent are available towards the cost of construction or
modernisation of privately owned facilities where there are significant environ¬
mental benefits by the removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the roads.

Operators
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small, privately owned
businesses. Many of the 130,300 holders of an operator’s licence in 1985 had
only one vehicle and the average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. The
biggest operator in Great Britain is the National Freight Consortium set up by a
consortium of managers and employees to acquire the National Freight
Company from the Government.
Those operating goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross weight (with certain
special exemptions) require an operator's licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and drivers’
hours. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms carrying their own
goods and standard licences, subdivided into ‘national only’ and ‘international’,
for hauliers operating for hire or reward. (In Northern Ireland operators carrying
their own goods do not require a licence.) Proof of professional competence is
required to obtain a standard licence. Regulations lay down limits on the hours
worked by drivers of goods vehicles, and there are also minimum rest periods.
Tachographs (which automatically record speed and distance covered, driving
time and stopping periods) must be fitted and used in most goods vehicles
over 3-5 tonnes gross weight in Great Britain.
International road haulage has grown rapidly and about 23 million tonnes a year
are carried in road vehicles to and from the continent of Europe and the Irish
Republic. Some 870,400 road goods vehicles were conveyed by ferry to the
Continent in 1985, of which nearly half were unaccompanied trailers. France is
the destination for over a quarter of the traffic to mainland Europe. The average
length of haul for British registered vehicles is some 860 km (534 miles) in each
direction, compared with 73 km (45 miles) for internal road haulage. Interna¬
tional road haulage is governed mainly by bilateral agreements which are in
force with 26 other countries. In June 1986 the European Community member
states agreed to the principle of full liberalisation of international road haulage
within the Community, to be implemented by 1992.
There has been a long-term decline in the use of local bus services, mainly
because of the growth in ownership of private cars. In 1985-86 buses or coaches
carried some 5,640 million passengers on local services in Great Britain, 25 per
cent fewer than in 1975. Bus operators have taken action to contain costs and to
improve productivity by increasing the proportion of bus services operated by
one-person vehicles and reducing or rationalising services, particularly in rural
areas. Encouragement has also been given to the promotion of unconventional
services in rural areas, such as community buses operated by voluntary drivers,
postbuses (Post Office vehicles carrying mail and passengers) and social
car-sharing schemes. However, the industry’s decline has continued, and the
Transport Act 1985 (see p 314) contains a number of measures to stimulate
competition in local bus services and increase private sector participation in the
industry.
These measures follow the reforms enacted in the Transport Act 1980, which
removed restrictions on operating long-distance express coach services and
excursions, allowing free competition between operators. This had a noticeable
effect on long-distance express coach services, bringing about reductions in
fares, the provision of more services and an increase of 40 per cent in the
number of passengers carried.
The largest single bus and coach operator in Britain is the National Bus
Company, which operates in England and Wales through some 60 subsidiaries
and has a network of long-distance coach services; it has a fleet of about 14,500
314

vehicles. The Scottish Transport Group operates the main bus services in
Scotland outside the major cities and also runs ferries to the islands off the west
coast of Scotland; it has 3,100 vehicles. In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are provided by subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company. Citybus Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast
and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland.
These companies have some 330 and 1,050 vehicles respectively.
London Regional Transport (LRT) is a nationalised industry, established
under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, with its board members
appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. Within LRT three separate
wholly owned subsidiaries have been established: London Buses Ltd (operating
some 5,000 buses), London Underground Ltd and LRT Bus Engineering Ltd.
Financial support is provided by central government with a contribution from
London's ratepayers. LRT is required to involve the private sector in the
provision of services where this is more efficient, and-has been set targets for
reductions in operating costs and revenue support. Passenger transport
executives are responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of local
transport in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear,
West Midlands and West Yorkshire in England and Strathclyde in Scotland.
Under the Local Government Act 1985 the executives in England report to
passenger transport authorities appointed by the district councils. The execu¬
tives operate 9.000 vehicles, while some 5,300 vehicles are operated by other
local authority undertakings.
There are some 5,700 privately owned undertakings (of which the majority
have fewer than five vehicles) comprising about 30,800 vehicles; only a small
proportion of these operators provide scheduled local bus services.
Double-deck buses are the main type of vehicle used for urban road passenger
transport in Britain and there are some 25,600 in operation. In addition, there
are 43,200 single-deck buses and coaches, and 79 trams (at Blackpool and
Llandudno which have Britain’s only remaining tramway systems).
There are about 39,100 licensed taxis in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas;
London has some 13,500. In London and a number of other cities taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to very strict requirements and drivers must have
passed a test of their knowledge of the area. Hire cars with drivers may be
booked only through the operator and not hired on the street; in most areas
outside London hire cars are licensed.
Major changes in the control of the bus industry and in the operation of bus
services are being implemented under the Transport Act 1985, which is
intended to encourage competition in the industry, making it more responsive
to passenger needs.
The Act provides for the privatisation of the National Bus Company, which is
required to submit to the Secretary of State for Transport a programme for the
transfer of its operations to the private sector for implementation by January
1989. The Government’s intention is that each subsidiary should be sold
individually, with a preference for a buy-out by its management and/or
employees. Passenger transport executives and local authorities running
municipal bus undertakings are required to form public transport companies,
operating under the Companies Acts, to which their bus undertakings will be
transferred. This is intended to lead to the establishment of a number of
separate competing companies except in London.
Under the Act the system of road service licensing (under which a local bus
operator needs a road service licence before starting operations) will be

abolished in Great Britain (except in London) in October 1986. Transitional
arrangements for the new system, under which operators have to register their
services with the traffic commissioners (one for each of the nine traffic areas of
Great Britain)," have been established. Operators wishing to run commercial
local services after October 1986 were required to register by the end of February
1986. Local authorities and passenger transport executives are looking at the
list of 15,000 registered services with a view to identifying gaps and to
examining additional services which they consider to be socially necessary and
are prepared to subsidise. They are inviting applications for operating these
services by open competitive tender to ensure that value for money is obtained.
Registered services must be run for at least three months to the end of January
1987, but thereafter, when the new deregulated system is fully in operation, six
weeks' notice will be required for new registration, variation or cancellation of
services.
The Act also provides for new arrangements for the operation of taxis and hire
cars, with the intention of increasing their role in public transport. Operators of
licensed taxis are able to provide shared-ride services at separate fares.
Restrictions by local authorities on granting taxi licences have been limited so
that a licence can be refused only if a local authority is satisfied that there is no
unfulfilled demand for taxis in its area. Taxi operators are also able to run
regular local services and can tender in competition with bus operators for the
services being subsidised by local authorities. In addition, they may apply for a
‘restricted’ bus operator’s licence, allowing them to run one or two minibuses
without having to obtain a full bus operator’s licence.
Transport services in rural areas are expected to benefit in a number of ways,
primarily through greater competition. In addition, two new grants have been
introduced: a rural innovation grant, administered in England by the Develop¬
ment Commission and in Scotland and Wales by the appropriate Secretary of
State; and a transitional grant, payable on a sliding scale for four years to bus
operators.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be worked
by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway companies
in Great Britain were brought under public ownership, and in 1962 the British
Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary activities. In
Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of
the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service
on some 320 km (200 miles) of track.
In 1985-86 the Board’s turnover, including financial support and income from
other activities but excluding internal transactions, was £3,145 million, of
which £1,333 million was derived from rail passenger services and £499 million
from rail freight services. British Rail received £896 million in grants towards its
operations as compensation for the public service obligation to operate parts of
the rail passenger system which would not otherwise cover their costs. Following
a report, published in 1983, which reviewed the finances of British Rail and
identified a number of opportunities for improved efficiency and reductions in
costs, the Government has set the Board new objectives including a reduction in
its public service obligation grant from the Government to £710 million in
1986-87.
At the end of March 1986 the Board employed some 173,800 people. Statistics
of British Rail’s operations are given in Table 28.
The passenger network (see map, p 316) comprises a fast inter-city network,
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local stopping services; and commuter

services in and around the large conurbations, especially London and south-east
England. British Rail runs about 1,500 Intercity expresses each weekday,
serving about 150 business and leisure centres. Journey times on inter-city
routes have been reduced substantially as more track has been made suitable for
high-speed operations and as a result of faster trains, notably the InterCity
125s, operated by High Speed Trains (HSTs), the world’s fastest diesel trains,
which travel at maximum sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h). InterCity
125 trains (which provide nearly half of InterCity train mileage) operate on the
London—Bristol—south Wales route, the London—Edinburgh—Aberdeen route,
the London-Plymouth-Penzance route, the London-Sheffield route and the
route linking south-west England or south Wales with Birmingham and
north-west England or north-east England and Edinburgh.
Electrification is continuing: in May 1986 electric trains were introduced on a
further 99 route km (62 miles). A number of electrification schemes, involving a
total of 928 route km (577 miles), are in progress. The most significant is a £306
million scheme to electrify the east-coast main line between London and
Edinburgh (including the line from Doncaster to Leeds). Initial work on the
scheme, which will involve electrification of some 636 km (395 miles), began in
1985. The first main stage, involving electrification from Hitchin to Peter¬
borough, is due to be completed by 1987, while the line to Leeds will be
electrified by 1989, with completion of the scheme to Newcastle upon Tyne and
Edinburgh in 1991. New rolling stock, including 31 Electra’ locomotives, which
will have a maximum speed of 225 km/h (140 mph), has been ordered for the
east-coast services. The west-coast main line, British Rail’s busiest InterCity
route, is already electrified. London, the West Midlands and the North West were
linked by electric trains in the 1960s, electrification being extended to Glasgow
in 1974.
British Rail has developed ways of reducing costs on its local passenger
services including the installation of automatic level crossings and radio
signalling. It has begun to replace the fleet of diesel multiple-unit trains by two
new types of vehicle with greater reliability and low maintenance costs: a
lightweight railbus (with a bus-type body) and a medium-weight diesel
multiple-unit.

The most important freight commodities handled are coal and coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum. Over 90 per cent of rail-freight revenue
is obtained from traffic in bulk commodities, most of it in trainloads.
Greater efficiency is being obtained with the introduction of new types of
wagon with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds, and of new, more
powerful locomotives, the latest of which can haul loads of 1,000 tonnes at
speeds of up to 130 km/h (81 mph). A network of some 130 daily scheduled
‘Speedlink’ high-speed freight services has been established between the major
industrial centres. Other developments, such as the concentration of freight
traffic at fewer but better-equipped terminals and a computer-based total
operations processing system, which monitors all consignments and freight
train and wagon movements in Great Britain, have contributed to a significant
increase in productivity and competitiveness.
British Rail has several other subsidiary activities. British Rail Engineering Ltd,
whose income amounted to £471 million in 1985—86, constructs locomotives
and rolling stock as well as undertaking heavy maintenance and overhauls for
British Rail; it also manufactures rolling stock for overseas railways. The
Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest of its type in the world.
Transmark provides consultancy services overseas on railway and associated
operations. Travellers-Fare is responsible for catering facilities at 163 stations,
while Intercity catering provides restaurant and buffet facilities on most
InterCity trains.
In order to concentrate its resources on running the main railway business,
British Rail has privatised its hotels, shipping and hovercraft businesses since
1980 and sold over £350 million of surplus property. It has attracted a further
£350 million of private sector funds for commercial development schemes in
connection with railway and station improvements. British Rail has also
adopted a policy of competitive tendering for its rolling stock needs, and has
invited private sector firms to play a greater role in train and station catering.
Some 762 million passenger journeys were made on London Regional Transport
trains in 1985—86. London’s Underground’ trains operate on 408 km (254
miles) of railway, of which about 167 km (104 miles) are underground, and serve
273 stations. There are 3,875 railway cars. Substantial investment is in
progress, particularly on station modernisation and ticketing facilities. The
Docklands Light Railway, a £77 million project financed by London Regional
Transport and the London Docklands Development Corporation, is under
construction and the 12-km (7-5-mile) route (which will have 16 stations) is
expected to be in operation in 1987.
Other public rail services in Great Britain are the Glasgow Underground and
the Tyne and Wear Metro, a new 55-km (34-mile) light rapid transit system with
over 40 stations, which is the largest provincial urban transport scheme in
Britain in the twentieth century.
There are over 40 small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in Great
Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited services for
tourists and railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of these railways, such
as the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, is the preservation of steam traction.
Britain and France have agreed to facilitate the construction of a fixed link
across the Channel and have chosen the project submitted by the Channel
Tunnel Group/France Manche (now known jointly as Eurotunnel) for twin
single-track rail tunnels with a vehicle shuttle service for cars, coaches and
goods vehicles. The project, estimated to cost some £2,600 million at 1985

prices, will be the largest civil engineering project in Europe to be undertaken by
the private sector, which will provide all the finance. It is expected to bring
substantial benefits to industry and to travellers through the quicker carriage of
both passengers and freight. Members of the Channel Tunnel Group are Balfour
Beatty Construction Ltd, Costain UK Ltd, George Wimpey International Ltd,
Midland Bank pic, National Westminster Bank pic. Tarmac Construction Ltd
and Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd, while Granada Group pic and Mobil Oil
Co Ltd are associate members.
The 49-km (30-mile) link will carry through rail services and a drive-on,
drive-off vehicle shuttle service using specially designed shuttle trains. Journey
time between the two terminals, Cheriton (near Folkestone) and Frethun in
France, will be some 30 minutes, with trains travelling at a maximum speed of
160 km/h (100 mph). Through passenger and freight services are planned, and
British Rail envisages investment of nearly £400 million for these services in
new passenger and freight rolling stock, track and signalling improvements, a
new passenger terminal at Waterloo (London), freight facilities and a train
maintenance depot. The terminal at Cheriton will cover 140 hectares (350 acres)
and will contain a rail loop for the shuttle trains to run into the tracks beside the
platforms. Road improvements in Kent are planned to ensure good access to the
tunnel terminal. The Government is keeping the environmental aspects of the
scheme under review to ensure that damage is kept to a minimum.
The Channel Link Treaty with France was signed in February 1986. It
contains provisions to safeguard the governments' interests in matters such as
safety and the environment, deals with matters of national jurisdiction, provides
arrangements for arbitration in the event of disputes over interpretation of the
Treaty between the governments and the concessionaires, sets out the private
sector nature of the scheme, and provides for compensation to the promoter in
the event of political interference or cancellation by the Government. The
concession agreement between the promoters and the governments was signed
in March 1986. However, this will not come into effect until after the enactment
of the Channel Tunnel Bill (which would authorise construction and make the
necessary financial and legal provisions) and the subsequent ratification of the
Treaty. Subject to the passage of the Bill and the ratification, construction work
could begin in 1987 with a view to services being inaugurated in 1993.
The inland waterways of Great Britain are popular for recreation, make a
valuable contribution to the environment and play an important part in land
drainage and water supply. They are also used to a limited extent for
freight-carrying. An official survey of inland waterway freight traffic reported
that in 1984, 64 million tonnes of freight were carried on inland waterways and
estuaries, covering some 2,400 million tonne-km (1-3 per cent of freight traffic
by tonne-km in Great Britain). About 44 per cent (in tonne-km) was carried in
the South East, mainly on the River Thames. Of the 3,200 km (2,000 miles) of
canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly owned British Waterways
Board, some 550 km (340 miles) are maintained as commercial waterways. The
Board also operates docks, warehouses and inland freight terminals, and has a
barge fleet, although most of the traffic on its waterways is conveyed by
independent carriers. In 1985-86 the Board’s turnover amounted to £18-2
million and it received government grants of £43-5 million to maintain its
waterways to statutory standards.
Ports
There are over 300 ports in Great Britain, but many are small harbours of only
local significance and do not handle cargo regularly. Most port authorities
320
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Port Traffic
Development
operate with statutory powers and responsibilities under private Acts of
Parliament. They are of three broad types: trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies.
Major ports controlled by trusts include Clyde, Dover, Forth, London, Medway,
Milford Haven, and Tees and Hartlepool. Local authorities control many small
ports but also the much larger ports of Bristol, Portsmouth and the new oil ports
in Orkney and Shetland.
Associated British Ports, established under the Transport Act 1981 as a
statutory corporation, wholly owned by Associated British Ports Holdings PLC (a
private sector company), owns and operates 19 ports including Southampton,
Grimsby and Immingham, Hull, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Other port
undertakings owned by statutory companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool and
Manchester.
In 1985 traffic through the ports of Great Britain amounted to 451 million
tonnes comprising 148 million tonnes of exports, 142 million tonnes of imports
and 161 million tonnes of domestic traffic (which included offshore traffic,
landings of sea-dredged aggregates and material shipped for dumping at sea).
About 62 per cent of the traffic was in fuels, mainly petroleum and petroleum
products. Some 72 per cent of the 13-5 million tonnes of traffic (108 million
tonnes of imports and 2-7 million tonnes of exports) which entered or left
Northern Ireland by sea in 1985 represented traffic with the rest of Britain.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total tonnage handled, are given in Table 29.
Offshore oil developments have had a substantial effect on port traffic by greatly
increasing the flow through certain North Sea ports, such as Tees and
Hartlepool and the Forth ports, creating new oil ports at Flotta in Orkney and
Sullom Voe in Shetland, and reducing oil traffic at many traditional oil¬
importing terminals. Two other significant changes have affected traffic at
British ports in the last 20 years. First, traditional major ports, such as London,
Liverpool and Manchester, have lost general (non-bulk) cargo traffic to ports like
Dover and Felixstowe which have developed specialised facilities to meet a
world-wide switch from conventional handling methods to container and roll-on
modes. While non-fuel traffic has been growing only slowly, container and roll-on
traffic has more than trebled since 1970 to 58 million tonnes in 1985 and now
accounts for about 40 per cent of non-fuel foreign and coastal traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are Felixstowe, London and Southampton and
for roll-on traffic are Dover (Britain's leading seaport in terms of the value of
trade handled), Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham, and Harwich. Secondly,
ports on the south and east coasts have increasingly gained traffic at the
expense of those on the west coast as the emphasis of Britain’s trade has
switched towards the continent of Europe.
Modernisation of Britain’s ports has been carried out primarily to accommodate
the growth in container and roll-on traffic, to speed the handling of bulk
commodities, and as a result of the changing nature and direction of Britain’s
trade. Many ports have modernised facilities and improved productivity by
changing port layout, introducing new handling equipment and reducing
manning levels. Most major new developments have been at east- and
south-coast ports. For example, at Felixstowe a £42 million container terminal,
completed in 1986, has raised the port’s container-handling capacity by about
50 per cent. Extra capacity for ferry services is being provided at Dover,
Portsmouth and Ramsgate, and a new freight ferry terminal at Dartford on the
Thames is under construction.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the British sector of the North Sea havfe
been built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe

a Belfast and Larne are the main ports in Northern Ireland and handled 6 million tonnes and 3-6 million tonnes
respectively in 1985.
(one of the largest oil terminals in the world). Three of the four jetties at Sullom
Voe can handle oil tankers of up to 350,000 deadweight tonnes, and the fourth
jetty handles the export of liquefied petroleum gases and can accommodate
vessels with a capacity of up to 75,000 cubic metres. A £54 million terminal has
been built at Braefoot Bay in the Firth of Forth to handle tankers carrying
natural gas liquids brought by pipeline from the plant at Mossmorran (Fife).
Supply bases for offshore vessels have been built at a number of ports, mostly on
the east coast.
Shipping
Britain remains a leading maritime nation, but in common with the fleets of
other developed countries, the British fleet has been adversely affected by the
world recession in shipping and increasing international competition. It has
declined substantially from a peak of 53-4 million deadweight tonnes1 * (33-7
million gross tonnes) in 1975 to 21-8 million deadweight tonnes (14-3 million
gross tonnes) in 1985. A large tonnage of ships, particularly of tankers, has been
scrapped or sold.
In July 1985, 19 million deadweight tonnes of trading vessels of 100 gross
tonnes and over were both owned and registered in Britain: 622 vessels totalling
7-4 million tonnes being usually employed as dry bulk cargo, liner or cellular
container ships; and a further 279 vessels of 11 -6 million tonnes as oil, chemical
or gas carriers. The merchant fleet figure of 21 -8 million deadweight tonnes also
includes non-trading vessels, such as fishing vessels, tugs and dredgers, and
shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.
British cargo liner tonnage is dominated by a relatively small number of large
private sector groups and container consortia. The representative body for the
majority of shipowners is the General Council of British Shipping, although
certain sectors have their own associations.
1 Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can cany before submerging the
load-line. Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed space on a ship.

Role of the
Government
About 94 per cent of Britain’s overseas trade by weight, about 80 per cent by
value, is carried by sea, while the proportion of passengers travelling to or from
Britain by sea is more than one-third, compared with about one-half in the early
1960s.
In 1985 British seaborne trade amounted to 285 million tonnes (valued at
£127,700 million) or 1 million million tonne-km (596,000 million tonne-miles).
Ships registered in Britain carried 23 per cent by weight, 20 per cent in terms of
tonne-mileage and 36 per cent by value. Tanker cargoes accounted for over half
this trade by weight, but only 19 per cent by value, and foodstuffs and
manufactured goods accounted for three-quarters by value.
Many of the deep-sea liner services from Britain are operated by container
ships. There are many roll-on services, accommodating passengers and their
cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles, between Britain and the continent
of Europe and several freight-only roll-on services to the Irish Republic, the
continent of Europe, and to some more distant countries.
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with each
other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is a common tariff of freight rates and other conditions
of service to be applied by each member line. Conferences serve all the major
trades to and from Britain. In 1985 Britain acceded to the United Nations
Convention for Liner Conferences, a wide-ranging code of conduct governing
relations among shipping companies that are members of conferences.
Almost all of the 26-3 million passengers who arrived at or departed from British
ports in 1985 travelled to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic,
services on other routes having largely been withdrawn as a result of the growth
of air services. Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for cruising
and in 1985 some 71,000 passengers embarked on pleasure cruises from British
ports.
Traffic from the southern and south-eastern ports accounts for a substantial
proportion of traffic to the continent of Europe. The main British operators are
Sealink UK Ltd (a subsidiary of British Ferries Ltd) and Townsend Thoresen.
Sealink UK Ltd and its continental partners (Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Franyais, and Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland of the Netherlands) operate
about 15 ships on continental routes.
Cross-Channel hovercraft services are provided by Hoverspeed Ltd, with
routes between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais. A hovercraft
crossing takes about one-third of the time taken by ships, and hovercraft carry
about one-sixth of the traffic on the short-sea crossings to France. Hoverspeed
operates five hovercraft including two British Hovercraft Corporation SR.N
Super 4s which have been structurally enlarged so that each accommodates 418
passengers and 55 cars, making them the largest hovercraft in the world.
Passenger and freight ferry services are also operated to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Orkney, Shetland and a number of other
Scottish islands.
The Department of Transport is the government department responsible for
most matters connected with merchant shipping, including Britain's relations
with other governments and international organisations on shipping matters.
The general policy is one of minimum intervention by the Government and the
encouragement of free and fair competition. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts
the Department does, however, administer many regulations for marine safety

and welfare, and for preventing and cleaning up pollution from ships. The Acts
also contain certain reserve powers for protecting shipping and trading interests
from measures adopted or proposed by overseas governments.
Britain's merchant fleet is one of the safest in the world with a lower record of
ship losses than the world average.
The Coastguard Service, administered by the Department of Transport, is
responsible for initiating and co-ordinating civil marine search and rescue
action in the United Kingdom Search and Rescue Region. It can call upon the
lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (a voluntary body which
operates 257 lifeboats), Ministry of Defence aircraft (including helicopters from
11 airfields around the coast), a long-range civilian helicopter based at
Sumburgh (Shetland), and any other ships or aircraft available to assist in
search or rescue action. In 1985 the Coastguard Service took action in 5,475
incidents (including cliff rescues) in which over 9,700 people were assisted.
The lighthouse authorities (for England and Wales the Corporation of Trinity
House, for Scotland the Northern Lighthouse Board and for Ireland the
Commissioners of Irish Lights) control about 370 lighthouses, many minor
lights and buoys, and a number of lightships, some of which are being replaced
by unattended sea marks or by light towers. In Britain there are 50 pilotage
authorities for the 93 pilotage districts and about 1,425 licensed pilots. Trinity
House is the largest pilotage authority, licensing some 570 pilots in 40 districts
in England and Wales. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is
the pilotage authority. However, the Government is planning to introduce
legislation under which the pilotage authorities would be abolished and their
responsibilities transferred to harbour authorities.
Compliance with traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain is
mandatory for all vessels of countries party to the 1972 International Collision
Regulations. The most important scheme affecting British waters is in the Dover
Strait, the world's busiest seaway. Britain and France operate radar surveillance
of the strait to keep watch on ships not conforming to the scheme and, through
the Channel Navigation Information Service, broadcast navigational informa¬
tion to ships in the strait. The Service, which operates from Dover, has a
radar-linked, automatic data-processing system for detecting and tracking
vessels, making it one of the most advanced centres in the world.
Civil Aviation
Britain’s substantial civil air transport industry is continuing to develop to meet
the increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel. The
airlines are re-equipping their fleets with the most modern aircraft, while many
airports are being substantially modernised and expanded.
The Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with more than 100 other
countries, the licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain
by overseas operators and British participation in the activities of international
aviation bodies), airports policy, amenity matters (such as aircraft noise),
aviation security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims to encourage a sound and
competitive multi-airline industry in Britain, to promote competition in
international and internal services, and to maintain high standards of safety. It
has liberalised airline services within Britain, and in its negotiations with other
countries on bilateral air service agreements it is proposing the adoption of more
liberal measures. Negotiations with some other members of the European

Community have already resulted in greater competition, leading to increased
traffic and lower fares.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body, respon¬
sible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry. It is
also responsible for the aerodrome navigation services at certain British airports
and, jointly with the Ministry of Defence, for the provision by the National Air
Traffic Services of air navigation services. Members of the CAA board are
appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport.
Under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 its primary objectives are to ensure that
British airlines provide air services to satisfy all substantial categories of public
demand at the lowest charges consistent with a high standard of safety and an
economic return for efficient operators, and to further the reasonable interests
of air transport users. Other duties are to ensure that British airlines compete
effectively on international routes, to secure the most effective use of airports in
Britain and to have regard to the need to minimise the adverse effects of civil
aviation on the environment.
In 1985 a total of some 52-9 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) to or from Britain, 3-4 per cent more than in 1984. Total
capacity offered on all services by British airlines amounted to 13,408 million
available-tonne-km in 1985: 10,166 million tonne-km on scheduled services and
3,242 million tonne-km on non-scheduled services. British Airways accounts for
some 76 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines.
In 1985 the value of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air was some £28,700
million and the proportions carried by air amounted to approximately 18-7 per
cent of the value of exports and 16-5 per cent of imports. Air freight is important
for the carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed of movement is essential. Precious stones, live animals, medicinal and
pharmaceutical products, clothing, leather and skins, and scientific instru¬
ments are major categories where a relatively high proportion of exports is sent
by air.
British Airways is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of
international passengers carried and of international passenger-km flown it is
the largest in the world. During 1985—86 British Airways’ turnover was £3,149
million (including £2,981 million from airline operations) and it recorded a net
pre-tax profit of £183 million. British Airways ceased to be a statutory body in
1984 when it was re-established under the Civil Aviation Act 1980 as British
Airways PLC, a public limited company under government ownership. The
Government intends to sell its shareholding in the company to private investors
as soon as practicable.
British Airways’ route network, covering some 520,900 km (323,700 miles) of
unduplicated scheduled route, is among the largest in the world. The airline
serves 145 destinations in 72 countries and in 1985 carried 18-4 million
passengers. International scheduled services are operated to the rest of Europe,
the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, East and South Africa, North
America, South America and the Caribbean. Within Britain it runs some 1,350
services a week to 14 towns and cities. Scheduled Concorde supersonic services
are operated from London (Heathrow) to New York and to Miami via Washington,
crossing the North Atlantic in about half the time taken by subsonic aircraft.
Other activities carried out include engine overhaul work and investments
in a number of hotel companies and air companies in Britain and other
countries.

748s and 7 Concordes.
The independent airlines carry 7-8 million passengers a year on scheduled
services and 14-2 million on charter flights. The main independent scheduled
airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of 27 aircraft and
carried 2-4 million scheduled service passengers in 1985. Its scheduled services
are primarily to the continent of Europe; North, West and Central Africa; the
United States; the Middle East; and Hong Kong. Other operators of scheduled
passenger services include British Midland, Air UK, Dan Air Services and Virgin
Atlantic. Britannia Airways, Dan Air Services, Monarch Airlines, Air Europe and
Orion Airways are the leading independent airlines operating charter passenger
services.
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work, but are mainly employed on the
large-scale operations connected with the development of Britain’s offshore oil
and gas resources. Light aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other
activities, such as charter operations, search and rescue services, crop¬
spraying, and aerial survey and photography. The two main helicopter operators
in Britain are Bristow Helicopters and British Airways Helicopters, with 62 and
31 helicopters respectively.
The CAA is responsible for air safety, both airworthiness and operational safety.
Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and application of safety
requirements concerning airline and private aviation operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Airworthi¬
ness Division is responsible for the airworthiness standards of aircraft
registered in Britain, the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers and the
approval of work schedules to which British transport aircraft are maintained.
Every company operating aircraft used for public transport must possess an
Air Operator's Certificate, which is granted by the CAA when it is satisfied that
the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its aircraft. The CAA's
flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) check that
satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Except for pilots with acceptable
military or other qualifying experience, all applicants for a first professional
pilot's licence must have undertaken a full-time course of ground and flying
instruction which has been approved by the CAA.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). The
Controller of the NATS reports to both the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. At
some 19 civil aerodromes, including most of the major British airports, the
NATS provides the navigation services necessary for the operation of aircraft
taking off and landing, and integrates them into the flow of traffic within British
airspace. To provide its services, the NATS uses radar, some 100 navigational
beacons, landing aids, air/ground communications and an extensive telecom¬
munications network.
Of the 135 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, about one-fifth each handles
more than 100,000 passengers a year. Ten handle over 1 million passengers a
year and these are shown in Table 30. In 1985 Britain's civil airports handled a
total of 71-8 million passengers (70-4 million terminal passengers and 1-4

million in transit), and 850,000 tonnes of freight. London's Heathrow airport is
the world's busiest airport for international travel and is Britain’s most
important airport for passengers and air freight, handling 31-6 million
passengers and 525,000 tonnes of freight in 1985. Gatwick is the world's fourth
busiest international airport.

Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—are owned and
managed by BAA pic, established under the Airports Act 1986 as the successor
company to the statutory British Airports Authority. A separate subsidiary
company will be established to operate each of the airports, which together
handle about 75 per cent of air passengers and 85 per cent of air cargo traffic in
Britain. All of the shares in BAA pic are at present held by the Secretary of State
for Transport, but the Government’s intention is to sell the shares during the
first half of 1987.
Many of the other public airports are controlled by local authorities and the
Act also provides for the larger airports to be formed into companies. Where any
airport’s turnover exceeds £1 million in at least two of the previous three years,
the local authorities will be required to form a company operating under the
Companies Act 1985 to run the airport's business and will be encouraged to
introduce private capital into the new companies.
All airports used for public transport and training flights must be licensed by
the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of adequate fire¬
fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable physical characteristics and
visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is granted. Strict aviation security
measures are in force.
The Government’s policy is to promote a strong and competitive British airline
industry by providing airport capacity where it is needed and by making effective
use of existing resources, especially at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. It is
also encouraging the maximum use of regional airports.
A fourth major terminal at Heathrow was opened in April 1986, raising the
airport's capacity from 30 million to 38 million passengers a year. Gatwick’s
current capacity is some 16 million passengers a year, but the second terminal,
the first phase of which is due to open in 1988. will eventually raise this to
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
327
25 million passengers. Following a public inquiry, planning permission was
granted in 1985 for the expansion of Stansted airport to an eventual capacity of
15 million passengers a year; in 1986 work began on the first phase, which
would provide capacity of some 7 million to 8 million passengers a year.
Facilities have also been improved at regional airports, with major terminal or
runway improvements undertaken at Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds/Bradford
and Newcastle upon Tyne airports. The Government intends to assist in
developing further opportunities for new routes and services, and will encourage
the development of Manchester as a ‘regional hub' airport.
Communications
The Government has introduced two major Acts to establish a new framework
for telecommunications services, one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the
economy. The British Telecommunications Act 1981 separated the Post Office
into two corporations, one for postal and banking services and the other for
telecommunications (British Telecommunications, known as British Telecom),
and provided for a limited relaxation of the statutory monopoly in telecom¬
munications. The Telecommunications Act 1984 strengthened the measures
taken to promote competition in a number of ways including removing British
Telecom’s exclusive privilege of running public telecommunications systems
and instituting new arrangements requiring those running telecommunica¬
tions systems (including British Telecom), with certain limited exceptions, to be
licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or, under delegated
authority, by the Director General of Telecommunications. There is provision for
licences to contain certain conditions including obligations to provide services
and requirements to connect with other systems. In British Telecom's case the
obligations to provide services ensure the continued existence of a universal
telecommunications service throughout the country and that certain essential
services, such as public emergency services, public call box services, maritime
emergency services and services in rural areas, are maintained. Mercury
Communications Ltd is licensed as the second major public telecommunica¬
tions network and provides a full range of services.
In 1982 a general licence for ‘value added network services' was issued,
permitting a wide variety of commercial services (other than the basic service of
conveying or switching a message) to be run in competition with British
Telecom over the public telecommunications networks. The licence was the first
of its kind and has placed the British system among the most liberal in the
world. Over 190 operators have registered under the general licence proposals
for nearly 800 different services, such as viewdata, conference calls, electronic
mail, and message storage and retrieval systems. Further liberalisation of the
licensing arrangements for value added and data network services took effect in
1986.
Private sector firms are now able to supply, install and maintain most types of
subscribers’ apparatus attached to the telecommunications network. British
Telecom’s monopoly over the supply and maintenance of a customer’s first
telephone instrument connected to its network ceased at the end of 1984, and
maintenance of newly installed call-routing apparatus will be fully open for
competition by November 1986.
The Office of Telecommunications, a government department established
under the Telecommunications Act 1984, is the independent regulatory body for
the telecommunications industry. It is headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions are to ensure that licensees comply with
the conditions of their licences; to promote effective competition in the
telecommunications industry; to provide advice to the Secretary of State for
328

General
Services
Trade and Industry and to users on telecommunications matters; and to
investigate complaints about services. The Director General also has a duty to
promote the interests of consumers in respect of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services.
Under the 1984 Act British Telecom was reconstituted as a public limited
company and a majority of the ordinary voting shares were sold to private
investors in 1984. It has nearly 1-6 million registered shareholders and 88 per
cent of its 230,000 employees are shareholders.
British Telecom serves some 17 million residential and 4 million business
telephone customers. It operates one of the world’s largest public telecom¬
munications networks, with almost 21 -5 million telephone exchange lines, more
than 104,000 telex connections, 76,500 public payphones and a wide range of
specialised voice, data, text and visual services. Over 80 per cent of homes in
Britain now have a telephone. The inland telephone and .telex networks are fully
automatic. International services are also highly developed, and international
direct dialling is available from any telephone line in Britain to nearly 170
countries, representing 93 per cent of the world’s telephones. Automatic telex
service is available to nearly 200 countries.
In 1985—86 the company made a pre-tax profit of £1,810 million on a turnover
of £8,387 million. Expenditure on capital equipment and other assets totalled
£1,973 million, of which £422 million went on modernising exchanges with
digital equipment. All capital spending came out of the company’s earned
income. About £160 million was spent on research and development.
British Telecom is investing substantial sums in the modernisation and
expansion of its network to meet the increasing demand for basic telephone
services and for more specialised services. By March 1986 the company had
nearly 125,000 km (78,000 miles) of optical fibre cable laid in its trunk network
in Britain, accounting for some 40 per cent of the network, a higher proportion
than any other world operator. There were more than 180 digital exchanges in
service. About half of its customers are served by modern local exchanges of
various types. The combination of digital exchange switching and digital
transmission techniques, using optical fibre cable and microwave radio links, is
substantially improving the quality of telephone service for residential and
business customers, compared with traditional analogue techniques, as well as
making possible a wider range of services through the company’s main network.
The new main digital exchanges can connect voice and data to customers
simultaneously, and support advanced services including text, fast facsimile,
picture videotext, graphics and slow-scan television. British Telecom was the
world's first operator to offer a pilot service, to selected business customers, over
an ‘integrated services digital network’. This service began in the London area in
1985 and has since been extended to other main business centres in Britain.
A wide range of high-speed switched data transmission services has been
available to business computer users since 1982.
British Telecom provides numerous facilities and services including a free
facility for emergency calls to the police, fire, ambulance, coastguard, lifeboat
and air—sea rescue services; a free directory inquiries service (which has been
modernised and now uses computer-stored information retrieval techniques);
and various other chargeable operator-connected services, such as transfer
charge and alarm calls. The operator-handled Freefone service, enabling users to
contact organisations at the called customer’s cost, has been supplemented
since mid-1985 by new automatic ‘LinkLine’ facilities, enabling callers to
contact organisations anywhere in Britain, either free or at local call rates.

British Telecom provides a number of customer-dialled recorded telephone
information services, now known as Guidelines, including Timeline (formerly
known as the Speaking Clock). The company also provides value-added recorded
services in various centres at higher call charges, and is required to make its
network facilities available for similar premium services provided by other
organisations operating under the general value added network services licence.
A public payphone service modernisation programme, costing some £160
million, is in progress and by March 1987 all public payphones will be equipped
with push-button equipment. A number of cashless call developments are being
carried out including the Phonecard service, using prepaid encoded cards,
which was initially introduced in main railway stations, airports and other
heavily used sites, but has been extended to many other parts of Britain. In the
Bristol and Bath area, an AccountCall facility was introduced in March 1986,
enabling public telephone users to insert a specially coded British Telecom card,
instead of money, and have the cost of calls charged to a private or business
telephone service account. There are some 300,000 rented payphones on
premises to which the public has access and these are also being upgraded with
modern push-button equipment.
Prestel, British Telecom’s public viewdata service, the first of its kind when
introduced in 1979 and enabling a wide variety of computer-stored information
to be called up on a special television receiver via the telephone, increased the
numbers of sets with its registered home and office users by 20 per cent during
1985-86 to nearly 70,000. Through its ‘Gateway’ links with other databases, a
wide range of other services, such as home shopping and banking services and
holiday booking and reservation facilities, has become available. Prestel has
been open to access from anywhere in the world since 1981.
There has been rapid growth in British Telecom's mobile communications
services including the jointly owned cellular radio network (see p 330). Its
radiopaging service had 337,000 customers by March 1986.
Voicebank, which stores recorded telephone messages for callers on a central
computer mailbox, extended its service from London to other main business
centres in England and Scotland during 1985-86.
Telecom Gold, British Telecom’s main electronic mail service, serves some
44,000 mailboxes.
British Telecom International is the company’s division handling international
networks and services. It is the second largest shareholder in the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (of which 110 countries are mem¬
bers) and in the International Maritime Satellite Organisation, with interests in
a number of other consortia.
A digital international exchange is already in service in London and two more
were ordered in 1985. Laying of the worlds first international undersea optical
fibre cable, between Britain and Belgium, was completed during 1986 and work
will begin on laying the first transatlantic optical fibre cable (TATS) in the
autumn of 1987. An agreement was reached in mid-1986 to lay a further
high-capacity transatlantic optical fibre cable (TAT9) in 1991. This will have
twin branches to Britain and France from the main cable and will be the first to
incorporate an undersea exchange.
By the end of March 1986 companies sending computer data world-wide from
Britain were able to use international ‘Packet SwitchStream’ services to 66
networks in 47 countries.
High-speed international satellite links to and from Britain were expanded
during 1985-86. The main business systems terminal at British Telecom
International s Teleport earth station in London became operational at the end
of 1985 and ‘SatStream’ private circuit digital links, using small-dish satellite

earth stations, were extended to cover North America and a number of countries
in Western Europe. An ‘International KiloStream' service, offering digital private
circuits for voice, text and visual services at speeds up to 64,000 bits a second, is
available to the United States, Australia and Japan.
Direct-dial maritime satellite services have been introduced for vessels
world-wide, via the earth station at Goonhilly in Cornwall. Limited in-flight
operator-controlled telephone call facilities have been introduced via Portishead
Radio Station near Bristol, and trials of an automatic service via satellite for
aircraft passengers will begin in 1988 on transatlantic routes, using specially
equipped British Airways aircraft.
Digital transmission techniques have been introduced for services to the
United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia via the Madley earth station
near Hereford. The service to Japan includes the world's first wholly digital
intercontinental public telephone service, giving faster connections and clearer
speech. '
British Telecom's overseas consultancy service, Telconsult, was engaged on 74
contracts in 30 countries during 1985—86.
Mercury Communications Ltd, a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless pic, operates
under licence as the second telecommunications carrier in Britain, enabling the
company to offer a wide range of services, both nationally and internationally. It
is establishing a new telecommunications system involving an optical fibre
trunk network centred on Birmingham, with cables laid alongside railway
tracks between major towns and cities. A southern loop incorporates London
and Bristol, and a northern loop Leeds and Manchester, and the network is
being extended to Scotland, Wales and the south coast of England. International
links are provided by two satellite communications centres: one in London's
Docklands, serving North America; and the other in Oxfordshire, serving the Far
East. Switched telephony services for large-scale customers began in May 1986,
and the provision of services to small business users and to residential
subscribers is planned later in 1986.
Cable and Wireless pic provides or manages a wide range of telecommunications
activities, mostly overseas in over 60 countries. The company used to be in the
public sector, but in 1985 the Government sold its remaining 23 per cent
shareholding.
Racal Vodafone Ltd (part of the Racal Electronics group) and Telecom
Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd (a joint venture between British Telecom and
Securicor) have been licensed by the Government to run competing national
cellular radio systems, which started in 1985 and now cover wide areas of
Britain.
By mid-1986 eight companies had been licensed to run local broadband cable
systems. At present they mainly provide television programmes, but some will
also provide interactive services including (in co-operation with British Telecom
or Mercury) voice telephony services.
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered postal services and was the first to
issue adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. The Royal
Mail provides deliveries to 23 million addresses and handles 43 million letters
and parcels each working day (11,000 million items a year). Mail is collected
from over 100,000 posting boxes, as well as from post offices and large postal
users. The Post Office has a monopoly on the conveyance of letters, but under
the British Telecommunications Act 1981 the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry has the power to suspend the monopoly in certain areas or for certain
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
331
Specialist
Services
categories of mail and to license others to provide competing services. The
Secretary of State has relaxed the monopoly on letters subject to a minimum fee
of £1, and has issued general licences enabling mail to be transferred between
document exchanges and allowing charitable organisations to carry Christmas
and New Year cards.
All the 80 offices equipped with mechanical handling equipment are in
operation and are gradually taking over the work of hundreds of sorting offices
handling letters manually. Each address in Britain has a postcode and the
British system is the most sophisticated in the world, allowing mechanised
sorting down to part of a street on a postman's round and, in some cases, to an
individual address. Some 34 large parcel centres, each serving a group of
counties, have taken over the work of 1,200 offices which handled parcels
manually.
As well as postal and National Girobank services, post offices handle a wide
range of transactions. In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent
for government departments and local authorities. The Post Office has adopted a
scheme for introducing new technology into its counter services to reduce costs
and raise productivity, while providing an improved range of services to
customers. There are nearly 22,000 post offices, of which some 1,500 are
operated directly by the Post Office and the remainder on an agency basis by
sub-postmasters.
The Post Office provides a range of specialist services. ‘Datapost International’, a
door-to-door delivery service, has overnight links throughout Britain and
international services to 82 countries including most of Europe and North
America. ‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery within or between some
84 main cities and towns in Britain. ‘Intelpost’, the world’s first international
public facsimile transmission service sending letters and other documents
electronically, provides high-speed mail links between more than 100 post
offices in Britain as well as to and from the United States and 26 other countries.
The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh handles about one-third of the Post Office’s
philatelic business, much of it involving sales to overseas collectors or dealers.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance on all
aspects of postal business to overseas postal administrations, and nearly 40
countries have used its services since 1965.
16 Employment
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force with high levels of
technical and commercial skill. However, in common with other industrialised
countries, it has suffered in recent years from high levels of unemployment. The
long-term solution to this lies in economic growth, which in turn depends upon
low inflation, financial stability and efficient, competitive industries. Improving
the operation of the labour market should help to create the most suitable
economic climate in which business can flourish and create more jobs. The
Government is helping to achieve this in a number of ways, including increasing
the flexibility of the labour market, removing burdens on employers and making
training more relevant to the economy’s needs.
TRENDS IN The total workforce in June 1985 was 27-6 million, of whom 21-5 million (11-9
EMPLOYMENT million men and 9-5 million women) were classed as employees in employment
(see Table 31). Britain has one of the highest proportions of people of working
age in jobs or seeking work among all the major industrialised countries, and
the workforce (which rose by about 1 million between March 1983 and the end of
1985) is continuing to grow as the population of working age increases and as
more women look for work. Recent trends have included the continuing growth
in the proportion of the workforce accounted for by women, as more married
women have sought work, especially in part-time employment; and a substantial
increase in self-employment. Between 1979 and 1985 the number of self-
employed people rose by 36 per cent to 2-6 million, representing 9-5 per cent of
the working population (the highest proportion since 1951).
There have been substantial changes in the nature and location of employ¬
ment, with a marked shift, as in other industrialised countries, from manufac¬
turing to service industries. Between 1955 and 1985 the proportion of
employees in employment engaged in service industries rose from 45 per cent to
65 per cent as higher living standards and technological developments
stimulated the growth of many service industries. During the period 1977 to
1985 the number of employees in service industries rose by over 1 million (8 per
cent) to 14 million (see Table 32). Employment in most service industries, with
some exceptions, such as public administration, education, transport, postal
services and communications, has grown considerably. The largest rise in this
period was in the banking, finance and insurance sector (by 30 per cent to
nearly 2 million), while other sectors with significant increases included hotels
and catering (21 per cent), medical and other health services (16 per cent) and
wholesale distribution and repairs (14 per cent). Manufacturing industry
accounted for 40 per cent of employees in employment in 1955, but by 1985 the
proportion had fallen to 26 per cent. Between 1977 and 1985 employment in
manufacturing fell by 25 per cent to 5-5 million. Nearly all manufacturing
industries have experienced a decline in employment as markets for manufac¬
tured goods have changed and as new technology has brought greater efficiency
and, in some cases, reduced the demand for labour.
UNEMPLOY- As in nearly all the major industrialised nations, unemployment in Britain has
MENT continued to rise (see Table 31), although the increase in the mid-1980s has
been much smaller than in the first years of the decade. In July 1986 some 3-3
million people, 11-9 per cent of the working population (11-7 per cent on a
seasonally adjusted basis), were unemployed. While unemployment has in-

creased in all regions, the higher rates are in areas which had the greatest
dependence on traditional manufacturing industries.
The Government's employment strategy is to maintain an economic, financial
and industrial climate in which businesses can operate successfully and create
jobs. It is taking action to improve the labour market by encouraging better
training, removing regulatory barriers which hinder recruitment by firms, and
providing an extensive range of employment and training measures for those
most affected by unemployment (particularly the long-term unemployed and the
young) to help them into productive work.

b Excluding adult students. Figures are adjusted for discontinuities and seasonal factors and are on the basis of
calculation in use from March 1986, excluding school-leavers.
c Not seasonally adjusted and including school-leavers.
In 1985—86 over £2,250 million was spent on the Government’s employment
and training measures and up to 700,000 people were being directly helped each
month. Several special schemes, as well as the Youth Training Scheme and adult
training measures (see p 337), are in operation.
The Enterprise Allowance Scheme, introduced for an experimental period in
1982 and extended to the whole of Great Britain in 1983, helps unemployed
people wishing to start their own business but who would be deterred by the
prospect of losing unemployment or supplementary benefit once they began.
Entrants, who must have at least £1,000 to invest in the business, receive an
allowance of £40 a week for a year while they start the business. Some 152,000
people have benefited from the scheme. Provision for the scheme has been
increased, to £153 million in 1986-87, and the number of places available is to
rise to 100,000 a year from 1987—88 onwards.
The Community Programme provides up to a year’s employment for long-term
unemployed adults on projects which are of benefit to local communities and are
run by sponsoring bodies, primarily local authorities or voluntary organisa¬
tions, but with funds provided by the Government. Expenditure on the
programme totalled some £693 million in 1985—86 and by March 1986 the
programme had some 200,000 participants engaged on about 10,300 projects.
Additional resources are being devoted to the programme and the target for the
number of filled places has been increased to 255,000 by November 1986. In
EMPLOYMENT
335
Northern Ireland similar assistance for the long-term unemployed is provided
through the Action for Community Employment scheme and Enterprise Ulster,
which together provided an average of some 5,000 jobs throughout 1985—86 at a
cost of some £25 million.
The Job Release Scheme enables older workers (disabled men aged 60 to 63,
men aged 64 and women aged 59) to retire early with an allowance provided that
their employer replaces them with an unemployed person. Since its establish¬
ment in 1977 some 300,000 workers have taken early retirement under the
scheme.
A number of pilot initiatives to help the long-term unemployed began in nine
areas in January 1986. These led to the establishment of a Restart Programme,
under which everyone in Great Britain who has been unemployed for a year or
more will be invited to an in-depth interview at a local jobcentre by March 1987.
The interviews are designed to see whether the participants can be placed in a
suitable job, enter the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, take up a place on the
Community Programme, enter a suitable training course, work on voluntary
projects or participate in a Jobclub (see p 336). A one-week Restart Course has
been established to assist the long-term unemployed with job-hunting tech¬
niques. To help those accepting low-paid jobs, a Jobstart allowance of £20 a

with gross earnings of less than £80 a week.
Other schemes include the Voluntary Projects Programme (with a similar
Community Volunteering Scheme in Northern Ireland), which allows unem¬
ployed people to take voluntary work without losing entitlement to state
benefits; the Community Industry Scheme, which provides temporary job
opportunities for personally and socially disadvantaged young unemployed
people aged 17 to 19; the New Workers Scheme, introduced in April 1986 to
complement the extended Youth Training Scheme by giving employers a
financial incentive to recruit those aged 18 to 20 at wages reflecting their relative
inexperience; and the Job Splitting Scheme, which is designed to increase
opportunities for part-time work.
In Great Britain responsibility for employment policy and for the payment of
unemployment benefit rests with the Department of Employment, while advice
on manpower policy issues is provided by the Manpower Services Commission
(MSC), a body on which employers, trade unions, local authorities and
educational interests are represented. The MSC is separate from the Govern¬
ment but accountable to the Secretaries of State for Employment, Scotland and
Wales. Most of its activities are financed from public funds. It is advised by a
network of area manpower boards on which employers, employees and other
local interests are represented.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain by the MSC, which offers a comprehensive service for
employers needing staff and for people, whether or not already in employment,
seeking jobs. It operates through a network of about 1,000 local jobcentres’
which handle all except professional, scientific, technical and managerial
occupations, for which the MSC’s Professional and Executive Recruitment is
responsible. Self-service facilities for job-seekers are being increased, with a
number of new small jobcentres being located in libraries and local authority
establishments. New technology is being utilised to provide job-seekers with
direct access through computer terminals to information on training and
employment.
Self-help centres, known as ‘Jobclubs’, for the long-term unemployed were set
up on an experimental basis in 1985 and the MSC is to increase the number of
centres from 37 in April 1986 to 300 by the end of 1986 and to 450 by the end of
April 1987. They are located mainly at jobcentres and provide free facilities (such
as the use of telephones and typewriters), together with intensive coaching and
expert advice on job-seeking techniques.
Registration for employment is voluntary for all unemployed people, whether
or not they wish to claim benefits. In the year to March 1986, 2-5 million
vacancies were notified and 1-9 million people were placed in employment
(including job-seekers who were placed in a job more than once during the year).
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Develop¬
ment, through its network of 28 jobmarkets’, provides a guidance and
placement service for all age groups, offering a range of services for employers
and employees. A computerised vacancy information system is planned to be
introduced in jobmarkets by 1988.
The public employment service provides a resettlement service to disabled
people. Specially trained Disablement Resettlement Officers advise on rehabili¬
tation and training courses and on the comprehensive range of special schemes
and facilities available. In 1985—86 the MSC found jobs for some 78,000
disabled people. The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 requires
employers who employ 20 or more people to include 3 per cent registered

disabled people within their workforce. As part of its ‘Fit for Work’ campaign to
improve the employment prospects of disabled people, the MSC runs a scheme of
annual awards for firms which excel in carrying out constructive policies on the
employment of disabled people.
The MSC runs a network of 27 Employment Rehabilitation Centres, which
provide facilities for those who have been ill or injured or are handicapped to
return to working fitness (some 15,000 a year). It also provides financial
assistance to voluntary and other bodies providing employment rehabilitation
courses.
Sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled in Great Britain
by Remploy Ltd and in Northern Ireland by Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd,
both non-profit-making companies, and by local authorities and voluntary
organisations.
Professional and Executive Recruitment is a specialist branch of the MSC
which, on a fee-paying basis, helps employers looking for professional,
managerial, scientific or technical staff and assists people seeking employment
at this level. It operates nationally, through a network of offices, and offers a
comprehensive recruitment service based on a weekly jobs newspaper which is
issued to all enrolled job-seekers, for whom the service is free. In Northern
Ireland the Professional and Executive Personnel Service is part of the general
employment service offered by jobmarkets.
Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 local education authorities must
provide a careers service to include vocational guidance for people attending all
educational institutions (except universities, which have their own careers
service) and an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities may also
provide an employment service for other people, mainly young people in their
early post-school years. The employment service provided by the MSC is also
available to young people.
The careers services in Wales and Scotland are the responsibility of the
respective Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland it is an integral part of the
Department of Economic Development.
The MSC Careers and Occupational Information Centre publishes material to
help people looking for jobs to make an informed choice, and distributes careers
literature to some 15,000 schools, careers offices and other centres.
Over half of the occupational training in Britain is carried out and funded by
employers. Statutory industrial training boards operate in seven industries to
ensure adequate training by raising a levy from employers and disbursing
grants for approved training. The majority of boards may exempt employers
whose training is satisfactory from payment of most of the levy. In other
industries, non-statutory training bodies, membership of which is voluntary,
take responsibility for the development and encouragement of training.
The Government funds training through the MSC. In recent years the MSC
has evolved a comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply of trained
manpower needed by the economy, to provide opportunities for people to acquire
new skills, and to improve the effectiveness of training generally. In 1981 the
Government announced a new initiative on training based on three important
objectives for the 1980s and beyond: better arrangements for skill training to
agreed standards: improving the vocational education and training of all young
people; and opening up more opportunities for adults to train.
The Youth Training Scheme, introduced in Great Britain in 1983, was expanded
from April 1986 so that it now offers two years of training for 16-year-old
school-leavers (including at least 20 weeks off-the-job training) and one year for
338
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Vocational
Qualifica tions
Adult
Training
17- year-old school-leavers, with a minimum of seven weeks off-the-job training.
The scheme is primarily employer-based and is open to both employed and
unemployed young people. All trainees will have the opportunity to obtain a
vocational qualification or credit towards such a qualification, and a certificate
giving their qualifications and experience. Broadly based training is provided in
the first year, with more specific training thereafter. Over 1 million young people
participated in the original one-year scheme and about 60 per cent of those
leaving went into jobs. In 1986—87 about 360,000 people are expected to enter
the two-year programme and by 1988—89, when it is fully in operation, about
500,000 people are likely to be in training at any one time, up to 200,000 more
than under the original programme. Government funding is planned to rise
from £800 million in 1985—86 to £925 million in 1986—87 and to over £1,100
million in 1988—89.
In Northern Ireland the Youth Training Programme, launched in 1982 and
administered jointly by the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Develop¬
ment and the Department of Education, is intended to meet the vocational
education and training needs of young people in the two years following the
minimum school-leaving age of 16. In their first year the young people receive
off-the-job training, work experience and further education, and in the second
year they are able to develop their vocational skills within employment (with at
least eight weeks off-the-job training and/or further education) or within
full-time training. In 1986—87 some 17,800 young people are expected to enter
the programme.
The Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, administered by the MSC
in Great Britain in co-operation with local education authorities, is intended to
stimulate the provision of technical and vocational education for 14- to
18- year-olds. Projects provide an integrated course of full-time education leading
to nationally recognised qualifications. Some 85 per cent of education authori¬
ties are operating or have applied to run such schemes, and by mid-1986, 74
projects were in operation, covering some 39,500 students. The results of these
pilot projects have been encouraging, and the Government has announced the
extension of the initiative to give all those aged between 14 and 18 the
opportunity to experience the wider curriculum available.
Following the report of a review group, a major reform of the system of vocational
qualifications is being implemented. A new national framework of such
qualifications, to be called the National Vocational Qualification, will be fully
operational in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 1991. A National Council
for Vocational Qualifications has been set up and will be responsible for
developing and monitoring the framework and accrediting qualifications of
bodies offering awards within it.
In line with the new initiative on training, in 1984 the MSC launched its adult
training strategy, under which its adult training programmes have been
restructured to provide help for a substantially greater number of people, and
training has been more closely directed towards the skills needed by employers.
The number participating in the adult training programmes rose from some
100,000 in 1983-84 to 220,000 in 1985-86.
The MSC’s largest programme is the Job Training Scheme, which comple¬
ments the training given in industry and commerce by providing people aged 18
and over with the opportunity to acquire new skills and improve existing skills.
Training is carried out in a nationwide network of skillcentres under the control
of the MSC’s Skills Training Agency and at many colleges and other training
providers. About 500 different courses are available in a wide range of
occupations. Greater emphasis is being given to training for those running or
hoping to start small businesses. The MSC's Training for Enterprise Scheme
EMPLOYMENT
339
offers courses in business management skills to those interested in becoming
self-employed or running a small business.
The MSC also provides support for employers' training efforts to help improve
the skills of the workforce and to encourage more and better training. A
programme of local grants to employers provides help for training employers’
workforces or new recruits, and the National Priority Skills Scheme is run
through industrial training organisations to help to tackle key skill needs. The
adult training strategy aims to develop a better and more responsive training
system, by using its own training programmes to demonstrate to employers and
individuals the benefits of good training and by encouraging training providers
to be responsive to labour market needs and modern training methods.
Training for the unemployed in basic work-related skills is being expanded
under the Wider Opportunities Programme. The MSC is paying particular
attention to improving the way training is carried out. Increased use of open
learning methods and materials is being supported through the Open Tech
Programme, with the aim of making training at technical and supervisory levels
available to all adults who can benefit from it in a form which can be adapted to
meet their own study circumstances. By April 1986, 250,000 people had
participated in the Open Tech Programme and by April 1987 the number
involved is expected to have increased to 500,000. A pilot training loans scheme,
designed to encourage adults to undertake vocational training of their choice,
was launched for a three-year period in April 1986.
The Skills Training Agency provides training services to employers in a wide
range of trades designed to equip selected employees with new or improved skills
of direct and immediate benefit to their companies. This training, specially
tailored to the employer's needs, is carried out either at the local skillcentre or,
using the Agency's Mobile Training Service, in the company’s own premises. The
Agency also provides training for overseas clients, either training students in
Britain or sending instructors abroad.
CONDITIONS OF The Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 provides a number of
EMPLOYMENT safeguards for employees. For example, most employees are entitled to receive
from their employers written information on their terms and conditions of
employment, disciplinary rules and the procedure available to employees
wishing to raise complaints; minimum periods of notice when employment is to
be terminated are also laid down for both employers and employees. Employees
with a minimum period of service of two years are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to exist (for example, because of
technological improvements or a fall in demand) and their employers cannot
offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed
to by both sides of industry. Protection against unfair dismissal is provided by
machinery under which an employee who has been in continuous employment,
normally for two years or more, may complain against an employer of unfair
dismissal, and, if successful, obtain reinstatement, re-engagement or com¬
pensation. Legal support is given to the right to trade union organisation (with
certain exceptions) by making it unfair to dismiss a person because of
membership or participation in the activities of an independent trade union;
rights of employees are also protected in regard to penalisation short of
dismissal because of trade union membership or activities. Other rights for
employees include limited payment when work is not available for reasons other
than as a result of a strike, lock-out or other industrial action, and maternity
rights for female employees.
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached the
statutory minimum school-leaving age (16).

In general, people coming to Britain for employment need a work permit issued
by the Department of Employment. Among other conditions, work permits are
issued only for work requiring a recognised professional qualification, or a high
degree of skill or experience, where the Department is satisfied that the worker
is necessary and there is no suitable worker in Britain or in other European
Community countries to fill the post. In general, the age limits for permits in
most categories are 23 to 54 years. People coming for certain kinds of specialist
employment (for example, ministers of religion and representatives of the
overseas media) and the self-employed do not require work permits but may
require entry clearances issued by a British Consulate or High Commission.
Permits are also issued under the Training and Work Experience Scheme for
nationals of countries outside the European Community who are undertaking
limited periods of training or work experience leading to the acquisition of a
particular occupational skill or qualification and to young people from outside
the European Community to undertake short periods of employment to broaden
their work experience and, if appropriate, to improve their knowledge of
English.
European Community workers entering another member state have the same
rights as nationals of that state as regards facilities of the national employment
services, pay and working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training
facilities, access to housing and property, and social security and industrial
injury benefits.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of
colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters. The Department of Employment
operates a Race Relations Employment Advisory Service with advisers based in
the main areas where there are large ethnic minority communities. Its general
aim is to promote equal opportunity in employment and its advisers offer help
and guidance to employers and unions on a wide range of issues which arise in
the employment of a multiracial workforce. The Commission for Racial
Equality's code of practice gives practical guidance to employers and others on
the best arrangements for implementing policies to eliminate racial discrimina¬
tion and to enhance equality of opportunity.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes it unlawful to discriminate on the
grounds of sex or marital status in employment, training and related matters.
The Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, requires that a woman doing the
same or broadly similar work as a man, or work which has an equal value,
should receive equal pay and conditions of employment. The Sex Discrimination
Bill includes provisions which would result in British legislation conforming
more fully to a European Community directive on equal treatment. The Bill
would also make unlawful the dismissal of a woman on the grounds of age when
a man in similar circumstances was allowed to continue in employment.
Pay rates for manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupa¬
tions, are normally set by collective bargaining (see p 345). Basic rates of pay
vary widely, and in private industry rates paid locally often exceed the rates
specified in national agreements. Higher rates are usually paid for overtime and
shift work, and weekly earnings may be further increased by incentive bonus
schemes.
According to the latest available information from the Department of
Employment’s New Earnings Survey, the average weekly earnings (including
overtime payments) in April 1985 of full-time employees on adult rates were
£171 (£192-40 for men and £126-40 for women). Earnings were higher for

Benefits
non-manual employees (£184-60) than for manual employees (£153). Some 49
per cent of manual employees and 19 per cent of non-manual employees received
overtime payments. Women’s earnings are markedly lower than those of men,
partly because on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at
premium rates, and partly because they tend to be concentrated in the less
well-paid jobs.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £15,000 to £30,000 a year gross before tax.
The posts with salaries in the range of £30,000 to £100,000 a year include those
of Cabinet ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions
in government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of
daily newspapers, leading members of professions and the higher managerial
posts in industry, commerce and banking. A number of company directors have
salaries exceeding £100,000 a year and some other people, such as leading pop
musicians and other star entertainers, may receive similar amounts through
fees, royalties or fixed contracts.
The basic working week in Great Britain is in the range 37-5 to 40 hours for
manual work and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually
worked. Actual hours worked differ from basic hours; in 1985 for full-time
employees they were 41-9 for men compared with 37-3 for women. Men and
women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than manual
workers.
Legislation limits the permissible hours of work for young people. Hours of
work of adult men and of women in non-industrial jobs are not restricted by
statute, but the maximum hours of women employed in industrial undertakings
are controlled and, in addition, they are not allowed to work at night or perform
shiftwork. However, the Sex Discrimination Bill would provide for the removal of
these restrictions.
Apart from industries where conditions are controlled by wages councils (see
p 347), there are no general statutory entitlements to holidays, and holiday
entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements. These generally
provide for at least four weeks’ paid holiday a year, and over 80 per cent of
manual workers covered by national collective agreements have entitlements of
more than four weeks, with some 20 per cent having five weeks or more.
Non-manual workers tend to have longer holidays than manual workers. Holiday
entitlements may also be dependent upon length of service.
Additional benefits exist in varying degrees. About half of employees in
employment are covered by pension schemes provided by their employers. Many
employees are also covered by occupational sick pay schemes which are
additional or complementary to the state schemes, and by schemes to provide
private medical treatment. A smaller number are covered by schemes for
redundancy payments above the statutory minimum. Such benefits are more
usual among clerical and professional employees receiving a standard salary
than among manual workers. Employees may have use of a company car and
some firms provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes. The Government
has encouraged employee share ownership by extending tax reliefs to profit-
sharing and share option schemes. The number of schemes open to all
employees in a company has increased from less than 30 in 1979 to over 1,000
in 1986 involving over 1 -25 million workers. The provision of low-priced meals at
the place of employment is usual in large undertakings and quite common in
smaller ones. Many offices and shops which are unable to provide canteen

facilities for their staff have adopted luncheon voucher schemes. Among the
other executive fringe benefits sometimes available are life assurance, free
medical insurance, telephone allowances and low-interest loans.
Trade unions have members in virtually every occupation and represent nearly
half the working population. As well as negotiating pay and other terms and
conditions of employment with employers, they provide certain benefits and
services—for example, educational facilities, legal advice and benefit payments
during industrial disputes—which vary from union to union. Trade unions vary
widely in the composition of their membership, and may be organised either by
occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed) or
by industry, while some are based on a combination of both.
During the 1970s trade unionism increased, particularly among clerical,
supervisory, technical and administrative workers, but in the 1980s there has
been a decline, greater than the fall in employment, reflecting the relatively
greater decline in certain industries (especially in manufacturing) with a high
level of union membership. At the end of 1984 the total membership of British
trade unions was about 111 million, of whom 79 per cent were in the 22 largest
unions with over 100,000 members. The number of unions has also fallen as
there has been an increase in mergers, and a number of small unions and of
long-established craft unions have been absorbed by larger unions. At the end of
1985 there were 409 trade unions on the list maintained by the Certification
Officer under the Employment Protection Act 1975. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers and
that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between workers
and employers, or between workers and employers' associations. Certain rights
and privileges are reserved for independent trade unions.
Among the largest unions are the Transport and General Workers Union (1 -5
million members), the Amalgamated Engineering Union (1 million) and the
General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (847,000); of the
non-manual workers' unions, the largest are the National and Local Government
Officers' Association (766,000 members) and the National Union of Public
Employees (673,000).
The central organisation of most unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by a secret ballot of the individual members of the union
and responsible to the annual conference of delegates from local branches.
Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of unions, and carry
out policy decisions made by the conference delegates. Most unions also have
regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual member there
are local branches, covering one or more workplaces. The organising of members
in individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
management at the workplace, may be done by full-time district officials of the
union, or, in many cases, by workplace representatives, often called ‘shop
stewards’, who are chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to
represent them. Where two or more unions have members in the same
workplace, representatives’ or shop stewards' committees may be formed to
discuss matters of common concern.
A number of trade unions are affiliated to the Labour Party and some sponsor
Members of Parliament. Any trade union wishing to use money for political
purposes must set up a separate fund, subject to special rules, one of which
must allow any member who objects to contributing to the fund to opt out. Some
5-9 million members contribute to a political fund and at the end of 1985,
50 unions maintained such a fund.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUG), which was founded in 1868. The TUC's objects are to promote

the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 91
trade unions which together represent 9-9 million people, or some 90 per cent of
all trade unionists in Britain, and it exercises power through influence rather
than through sanctions. The TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions, both nationally and internationally, and provides a forum
in which affiliated unions can collectively determine policy. It is consulted by
the Secretary of State for Employment before the appointment of employee
representatives on the Manpower Services Commission, the Advisory, Con¬
ciliation and Arbitration Service and certain other official bodies with an
interest in employment matters. There are eight TUC regional councils for
England, and a Wales Trades Union CounciL
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists. A General Council represents it between Congresses and is
responsible for carrying out Congress decisions, watching economic and social
developments, providing educational and advisory services to unions, and
presenting to the Government the trade union viewpoint on economic, social
and industrial issues. The TUC is also empowered to mediate in inter-union
disputes in certain circumstances, and uses its authority to try to resolve such
difficulties.
The TUC, as well as many individual unions, conducts extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade union¬
ism, and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers'
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, which in many respects is similar in constitution and
function to the TUC. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU),
although the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions
based in Great Britain. Over 75 per cent of Northern Ireland trade unionists are
members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority belong to
unions which are also affiliated to the TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU has no political affiliations and enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
The beginnings of the present law on industrial relations were established a
century ago, when trade union members were freed from liability to charges of
criminal conspiracy; at the same time trade unions were granted certain
immunities, including immunity from liability to damages for the economic
effects of strike action. Peaceful picketing during strikes was also made legal. At
the beginning of the present century unions were given a wide degree of
immunity from legal action under the civil law, and the immunities of those
organising industrial action were also strengthened.
The Employment Acts 1980 and 1982 were designed to obtain a better balance
between rights and responsibilities in industrial relations. The 1980 Act
enabled the Government to make funds available to encourage the wider use of
secret union ballots and to produce codes of practice to promote good industrial
relations. It limited lawful picketing to the picket’s own place of work and
restricted the scope for secondary action such as blacking and sympathetic
strikes. It provided greater protection for the individual working in a ‘closed
shop' (that is, under an agreement between the employer and one or more
unions that union membership is a condition of employment) and removed legal
344
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
EMPLOYERS’
ORGANI¬
SATIONS
protection from any new closed shop which had not been approved in a secret
ballot by 80 per cent of the employees affected. As provided for in the Act, the
Government has published codes of practice on the conduct of picketing and the
closed shop. Illegal activities such as violence on picket lines are subject to the
criminal law, which is enforced by the police, but unlawful picketing is a matter
for employers to restrain by means of civil law.
The 1982 Act was designed to carry the process further. It increased the
compensation for employees unfairly dismissed for non-membership or
membership of a union and introduced compensation (from government funds)
for certain employees dismissed because of non-membership of a union in a
closed shop between 1974 and 1980, when they had no protection. The Act also
removed legal protection from all closed shops (not only from new ones, as in the
1980 Act) where within two years of the legislation taking effect the closed shop
had not been supported in a secret ballot held in the previous five years by 80 per
cent of the employees affected or by 85 per cent of those voting in the ballot.
Where legal protection is removed, any dismissal for non-membership of a union
is unfair. Terms in commercial contracts specifying the use of union labour only
were made unenforceable and discrimination on the basis of union membership
in the awarding of contracts was made unlawful. Industrial action which seeks
to persuade employers to discriminate in this way or to interfere with the supply
of goods or services on grounds of union membership is unlawful. The Act also
ended the position which gave trade unions almost complete immunity from all
civil actions by bringing their position into line with that of their individual
officials and members. This means that trade unions now have immunity only
for action taken in furtherance or contemplation of a lawful trade dispute. There
were also changes to the definition of a trade dispute upon which immunity for
civil actions depends. Disputes between employer and employees (that is, most
industrial action) continue to qualify as lawful trade disputes, but disputes
which have become unlawful are those where there is no disagreement between
an employer and his or her employees, or those which have little to do with the
normal subject of a trade dispute (such as terms and conditions of work).
The Trade Union Act 1984 was introduced by the Government to increase
democracy in trade unions. It requires that all voting members of the principal
executive committee of a union should be elected by a secret and direct ballot of
the members at least once every five years, and requires unions to compile and
maintain a register of members’ names and addresses. It also removes legal
immunity from trade unions which call a strike or take other industrial action
without first holding a secret ballot of members concerned and securing a
majority vote for this action. In addition, the Act requires trade unions with
political funds to ballot their members at regular intervals to decide whether the
funds should be retained. Unless members had been balloted in the previous ten
years, trade unions with political funds were required to hold a ballot in
1985-86 and all of the 38 unions involved voted to retain their funds. In general,
the new legislation was opposed by the TUC and by most trade unions, and the
TUC is looking at industrial relations legislation with a view to putting forward
alternative proposals.
Northern Ireland has a broadly similar but separate system of industrial
relations legislation.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers' organisations, some of
which are wholly concerned with labour matters although others are also
concerned with commercial matters or trade associations. The primary aims of
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of
employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety,
health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient

use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may
arise. Combined employers' organisations and trade associations may also
represent members’ points of view as manufacturers or traders to the
Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis, for example, the Engineering Employers' Federation. A few
are purely local in character or deal with a section of an industry or, for example,
with small businesses; most are national and are concerned with the whole
of an industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional
organisations combined into national federations, while in others, within which
different firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a
complex structure with national and regional federations for parts of an
industry as well as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 340
employers' associations known to the Certification Officer. Those which are
national organisations negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned; most of these national organisations
belong to the Confederation of British Industry.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is the largest central employers’
organisation in Britain, representing directly or indirectly some 250,000
businesses which together employ about half the working population. It aims
primarily to ensure that Government, national and international institutions
and the public understand the needs, intentions and problems of business.
Membership ranges from the smallest to the largest companies, private sector
and nationalised, and covers a broad spectrum which includes manufacturing,
agriculture, construction, distribution, mining, finance, retailing and insur¬
ance. Most national employers’ organisations, trade associations and some
chambers of commerce are members. Policy is determined by a council of 400
members, and there is a permanent staff of 340, while there are 13 regional
offices and an office in Brussels. The CBI is the British member of the Union of
Industries of the European Community. The CBI nominates the employers’
representatives on a number of bodies including the National Economic
Development Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and
Safety Commission and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of employees
and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on freely
conducted negotiations at all levels. The government-funded, but independent.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) provides its services
where the usual methods of resolving disagreements have failed. Because of the
publicity they receive, strikes are commonly thought to occur much more
frequently in Britain than in other countries. International comparisons show,
however, that Britain's record on industrial disputes is better than those of a
number of other major industrialised countries. In 1985 some 6-4 million
working days were lost in Britain through industrial stoppages, of which about
two-thirds were accounted for by a major dispute in the coal industry, while the
number of recorded disputes was the lowest for nearly 50 years.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for the
conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement between
employers or employers’ associations and trade unions. Agreements may be
industry-wide, as is generally the case in the public sector, but are often
supplemented by local agreements in companies or factories (plant bargaining),
and bargaining and consultation are increasingly being conducted at plant level.

In some industries, companies and factories, negotiations are conducted by
meetings held when necessary, while in others, joint negotiating councils or
committees have been established on a permanent basis. The scope of the
various bodies (from national joint industrial councils for whole industries to
works councils and committees in individual workplaces) varies widely, and can
cover such additional matters as production plans, investment, training,
education, welfare and safety. Normally these arrangements for collective
bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but there is often
provision for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent
conciliation or arbitration. The Employment Protection Act 1975 as amended by
the Employment Act 1980 makes provision for information needed for collective
bargaining purposes to be disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service is an independent statutory
body with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial
relations, and in particular of encouraging collective bargaining and the
development and (where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
ACAS is controlled by a council consisting of a full-time chairman and nine
part-time members experienced in industrial relations, of whom three are
nominated after consultation with the CBI, three after consultation with the
TUC, and three are independent. The Service conciliates in industrial disputes
in both the public and private sectors. ACAS assistance is sought in some 1,500
disputes each year. In addition, there are some 160 further requests a year for
ACAS to provide arbitration, which it may do either by appointing single
arbitrators or boards of arbitration or by referring cases to the Central
Arbitration Committee (see below). Although ACAS has prime responsibility for
helping to resolve disputes, and has also set up major committees of inquiry, the
Secretary of State for Employment retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry
or committee of investigation into a dispute, but these are rarely used.
The Service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and employment
policies to employers, managers, trade unions, employee representatives and
individuals, and it handles nearly 280,000 inquiries a year. Specialist staff make
nearly 10,000 advisory visits a year. ACAS also carries particular responsibility
for attempting conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual em¬
ployee rights (such as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints
under the Equal Pay Act 1970, including claims for equal pay for work of equal
value, and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination Act
1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976). There are nearly 43,000 such cases each
year. In 1985 the Work Research Unit, whose task is to promote, jointly through
trade unions and employers, the improvement of work structures and the
quality of working life, was incorporated within ACAS.
The Central Arbitration Committee is an independent standing arbitration
body. It provides boards of arbitration for the settlement of trade disputes
referred to it with the consent of the parties concerned and adjudicates on
claims, including those made under the disclosure of information provisions of
the Employment Protection Act and under the Equal Pay Act.
The Office of Manpower Economics is an independent non-statutory organisa¬
tion responsible for servicing independent review bodies which advise on the
pay of various public-sector groups. These are the Top Salaries Review Body,
the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body, the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body, and
the Review Body for Nurses and other National Health Service professions. The
Office also provides services for the Pharmacists’ Review Panel, the Police

In a small number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers
or employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sector, with three independent
members. There are 26 wages councils covering about 2-75 million workers,
primarily in service industries such as retailing, catering and hairdressing. The
system has been criticised as an obstacle to the creation of jobs, and the Wages
Act 1986 provides for changes in the powers and functions of wages councils
with the intention of simplifying the requirements imposed by the councils.
Wages orders will be restricted to workers aged 21 or over and the councils will
be able to set only a single minimum hourly rate, a single overtime rate and a
limit on deductions for accommodation provided. Before making an order, a
council will be required to consider the effect on employment.
Employers have a duty at civil and criminal law to take reasonable care of their
employees, and others affected by their work activities, and to provide a safe
system of working, while employees have a duty of care towards each other and
also to take care of their own safety. The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Its purpose is to secure the health, safety and
welfare of people at work and to provide for the protection of the public whose
health and safety might be affected by work activities. The Act places general
duties on everyone concerned with work activities, including employers, the
self-employed, employees, manufacturers and suppliers.
The 1974 Act is superimposed on earlier health and safety legislation, such as
the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, the Factories Act 1961 and the Offices, Shops
and Railway Premises Act 1963 and the various regulations made under them.
The earlier legislation imposes specific obligations and standards on, for
example, occupiers of particular types of premises or employers engaged in
particular activities and covers such matters as the fencing of machinery,
precautions against the exposure of people to toxic dusts and gases, precautions
against fire, dangerous substances and special risks, the safe condition of
premises, and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
Some of the earlier legislation was replaced immediately by the 1974 Act, but
the remainder continues in force pending its progressive replacement by
regulations and codes of practice. Regulations made under the Act govern the
establishment of first-aid facilities, the control of work with lead and the control
of major accident hazards in industry, each set being supported by either an
approved code of practice or other guidance material, and there are others in the
course of development.
A basic principle underlying the 1974 Act is that employers, in consultation
with their employees, should have the responsibility of working out health and
safety arrangements, within the broad obligations of the law, to suit their own
workplaces. Employers with five or more employees must draw up a written
policy for safety and health, and must inform their employees of the policy and of
the arrangements for its implementation. In workplaces where negotiations take
place with a trade union, the union may appoint safety representatives to be the
employees' official channel for representation and consultation over safety
matters.
The Health and Safety Commission, established by the 1974 Act and account¬
able to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Employment, has
responsibility for developing policies, including guidance, codes of practice, or
348

proposals for regulations. In the case of proposals for changes in legislation, the
Commission consults the people who will be affected by them and makes
recommendations to the Secretary of State concerned. The Commission has an
independent chairman, three members appointed after consultation with the
CBI, three after consultation with the TUC, and two after consultation with local
authority associations. The Commission has six subject advisory committees
(on toxic substances, on dangerous substances, on dangerous pathogens, on
genetic manipulation, on the safety of nuclear installations, and on medical
matters), and 11 industry advisory committees, for agriculture, ceramics,
construction, education, foundries, health services, oil, paper and board,
printing, railways and rubber.
The 1974 Act also set up the Health and Safety Executive, which includes
government inspectorates covering a range of work activities: the Factory
Inspectorate (which also deals with a large number of activities outside factories
such as hospitals and educational establishments) and inspectorates for mines
and quarries, agriculture, major sources of industrial air pollution, nuclear
installations, and explosives. It also includes the Medical Division and the
Research and Laboratory Services Division. The inspectors, who have powers of
entry and enforcement, seek compliance with health and safety legislation in
individual workplaces and give advice. The Medical Division, through the
Employment Medical Advisory Service, provides a nationwide service of advice
on the medical aspects of employment problems to employers, employees, trade
unions, doctors and others.
The Research and Laboratory Services Division provides scientific and
medical support and testing services, and carries out research both in its own
laboratories and through universities and other institutions on a contract basis,
often jointly funded by industry. Areas of study include explosion risks, fires,
protective equipment, methods for monitoring airborne contaminants, occupa¬
tional medicine and hygiene, and the safety of engineering systems.
In some premises, mostly offices, shops, warehouses, restaurants and hotels,
health and safety legislation is enforced by inspectors appointed by local
authorities, working under guidance from the Health and Safety Commission.
Some other official bodies work under agency agreement with the Health and
Safety Commission, for example, the Railway Inspectorate (concerned with
worker safety on railways), the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate for Scotland
(concerned with the control of emissions to the atmosphere) and the Depart¬
ment of Energy (concerned with health and safety in the oil industry).
In Northern Ireland, the Health and Safety Agency, roughly corresponding to the
Health and Safety Commission, and an Employment Medical Advisory Service
were set up by the Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978. The Northern
Ireland Department of Economic Development, through its Health and Safety
Inspectorate, is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety
legislation, which is broadly similar to that for Great Britain.
17 Public Finance
PLANNING
PUBLIC
FINANCE
The Planning
Cycle
Public finance is concerned with taxation, expenditure and borrowing by central
and local government and the financing of public corporations. Central
government raises money from individuals and companies by direct and indirect
taxation and from National Insurance contributions. It spends money on goods
and services, such as health and defence, and in payments to people, such as
social security and pensions. Local government receives substantial grants from
central government and raises revenue mainly through rates (local property
taxes). From these resources it provides services such as education, police and
fire services, and refuse collection. The external finance of the nationalised
industries and other public corporations also has to be financed by
government—from taxation or borrowing. The diagram (see p 357) shows the
relative importance of the various items of receipts (including borrowing) and
expenditure for the public sector.
The government department responsible for broad control of public finance
and expenditure is the Treasury. The Bank of England (the central bank) advises
the Government on financial matters, executes monetary policy and acts as
banker to the Government.
The background to the present Government’s planning of public finance is the
medium-term financial strategy introduced in 1980. The Government’s aim is to
maintain a firm financial framework, with a progressive reduction in monetary
growth and public borrowing as a proportion of national output, in order to
secure a fall in inflation and create the conditions for sustainable growth. With
commitments also to reduce taxation and curb the role of the state, the
Government has therefore sought to reduce public expenditure as a proportion
of national output as well. The objective is to hold public expenditure broadly
level in real terms so that economic growth will lead to the reduction sought.
Public expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product fell from over 46
per cent in the early 1980s to 44-5 per cent in 1985-86. A continued steady
decline is projected, to 41 per cent by 1988-89.
Table 33, showing projections for the public sector borrowing requirement,
indicates the planning total for public expenditure rising from £139,100 million
in 1986—87 to £153,000 million in 1989—90.
Each year the Government conducts a review (the ‘public expenditure survey’) of
its expenditure plans for the forthcoming three years and publishes the
resulting totals, together with any changes in National Insurance, in the
Autumn Statement around November. Details of these plans and of the aims of
government expenditure and the output obtained are given in the annual public
expenditure White Paper which appears early in the following year, before the
Budget.
The Government’s updating of the medium-term financial strategy and
consequent plans for financing expenditure over the following year, including
any tax changes, are set out in the Financial Statement and Budget Report,
published with the Budget around the end of the financial year (31 March).
Details are announced subsequently in the Finance Bill, which is presented to
Parliament shortly after the Budget and becomes law during the summer.

a These imply lower taxes or higher expenditure than assumed in the figures for general government expenditure
and receipts.
Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
Planned public expenditure for 1986—87 has been set at just over £139,000
million. Of this, £103,000 million is allocated to central government, £35,000
million to local authorities and £2,000 million to nationalised industries and
other public corporations (excluding those to be privatised in 1986—87). The
reserve (see below) accounts for £4,500 million. In line with international
conventions, proceeds from privatisation, projected at £4,750 million, count as
negative public expenditure.
Central government spending is largely voted by Parliament through the
annual Supply Estimates (see p 352). The rest consists mainly of those social
security payments which are made out of the National Insurance Fund. The
largest departmental programmes are those on social security payments (31 per
cent of planned departmental spending in 1986—87), defence, and health and
personal social services (each 13 per cent). See Table 34.
About half of local authority spending is financed by grants from central
government. The rest is met from rates and from borrowing. Education
accounts for around one-third of local authority spending.
Of the total contribution of public corporations to the planning total, about
half is attributable to the external finance (that is, grants from the Government
and borrowing within Britain and from overseas) of the nationalised industries.
Of planned expenditure in 1986—87, cash payments to the personal sector—
for example, pensions and other social security benefits—comprise over
one-third; pay (other than that included in departmental running costs) and
purchases of goods and services each about one-quarter; and departmental
running costs a little under one-tenth. The economic breakdown of each
department's spending varies. Planned capital spending in 1986—87 by central
and local government is £14,200 million and that by nationalised industries and
other public corporations £4,600 million.
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated reserve to cover all additions to
departmental spending during the year, whether arising from revisions to the
estimated size of demand-led programmes, policy changes or new initiatives. For
1986—87 the reserve is £4,500 million. Larger amounts have initially been set

b Difference between total and the sum of its component parts is due to rounding.
Note: Expenditures on certain services (such as education) are made under the programmes for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland in addition lo other departmental programmes.
Some 40 per cent of public expenditure is subject to control by cash limits
(external financing limits in the case of nationalised industries). Another 40 per
cent consists of demand-led services (for example, social security benefits) on
which, once policy and rates of payment have been determined, expenditure in
the short run depends on the number of eligible recipients. The remaining 20
per cent is current expenditure of local authorities, which central government
does not directly control; however, the major part of the contribution by central
government to such expenditure, the rate support grant, is subject to cash
limits.
Once fixed, cash limits are not usually revised during the course of the year
unless a decision is taken to alter the level of provision for the service concerned.
There is, however, a limited facility for carrying forward underspending on the
capital components of cash limits. If any overspending of cash limits occurs, a
corresponding deduction is normally made from the limits for the following year.

The annual public expenditure survey conducted by the Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each government department submits to the
Treasury in December, giving details of its cash requirements for the financial
year beginning in the following April. After approval by the Treasury, these
Supply Estimates are presented to Parliament in March, usually at the same
time as the Budget (see p 353). Parliament approves them in July as part of the
Annual Appropriation Act, expenditure between 1 April and this date being
covered by Votes on Account approved before the start of the financial year.
Supplementary Estimates may also be presented to Parliament during the
course of the year. If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the Public Accounts
Committee (see below) will investigate fully before Parliament is asked to approve
any Excess Vote to balance the account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for debates on the Supply Estimates,
following scrutiny by select committees of the House of Commons.
In 1986—87 the Supply Estimates totalled £99,000 million of which £75,000
million was direct spending by central government and £24,000 million
transfers to other parts of the Government or the public sector. Some items of
central government expenditure, for example, the salaries and pensions of
judges, are paid directly out of the Consolidated Fund (see below) as standing
services and are not subject to annual approval by Parliament.
Examination of public expenditure is carried out by select committees of the
House of Commons, which study in detail the activities of particular government
departments and require the attendance of ministers and officials for cross-
examination. The audit of the Government's spending which follows up the
control inherent in parliamentary approval of the Estimates is exercised
through the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public
Accounts Committee.
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an officer of the House of Commons
appointed by the Crown, has two distinct functions. As Comptroller General, he
has the duty to ensure that all revenue and other public money payable to the
Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund (see below) is duly paid and
that all payments out of these funds are authorised by statute. As Auditor
General, his duties are to certify the accounts of all government departments
and those of a wide range of other public sector bodies; to examine revenue
accounts and inventories; and to report the results of his examinations to
Parliament. He also has wide statutory powers to carry out, and report to
Parliament on, examinations of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use
of resources by those bodies he audits or to which he has right of access.
The Public Accounts Committee considers the appropriation and other accounts
of government departments and the Comptroller and Auditor General’s reports
on them and on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of departments' use of
their resources. The Committee takes evidence from the official heads of
departments and relevant public sector bodies and submits to Parliament
reports which carry considerable weight, and its recommendations are taken
very seriously by the departments and organisations that it examines. The
Government's formal reply to the reports is presented to Parliament by the
Treasury in the form of Treasury minutes and the reports and minutes are
usually debated annually in the House of Commons.
The Government's sterling expenditure is largely met out of the Consolidated
Fund, an account at the Bank of England into which tax receipts and other
revenues are paid. This is also known as the Exchequer. Any excess of
expenditure over receipts is met by the National Loans Fund, which is another

THE BUDGET

REVENUE
official sterling account at the Bank of England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National Insurance Fund, into which
contributions are paid by all employers and employed people, is used mainly to
pay for social security benefits; a small proportion of the Fund is used to help
finance the National Health Service.
The Budget—usually in March or April—sets out the Government’s proposals for
changes in taxation and is the main occasion for an annual review of economic
policy. The proposals are announced to the House of Commons by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget statement and are published in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report. This report also contains a review of
recent developments in the economy, together with an economic forecast—one
of the two which the Government is required to publish each year (the other
being contained in the Autumn Statement)—and sets out the fiscal and
monetary framework within which economic policy operates. This is the
medium-term financial strategy (see p 349).
The Budget statement is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means (or
Budget) resolutions in which the proposals are embodied. When passed by the
House of Commons, these resolutions give temporary effect, under the
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, to certain of the tax proposals; they are
the foundation of the Finance Bill, in which the proposals are set out for detailed
consideration by Parliament, becoming law as the Finance Act, usually in
the following July. The effect of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act is
thus to enable the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, at the
levels provided by the Budget proposals, pending enactment of the Finance
Bill.
The bulk of the tax proposals are concerned with changes in the rates or
coverage of taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the abolition of existing ones
and changes in the administrative machinery. These changes are made not only
with regard to the revenue required but also with regard to their effect on the
way the economy performs.
For two taxes—income tax and corporation tax—annual Ways and Means
resolutions followed by Finance Act clauses are required to maintain their
existence, since they are annual rather than permanent taxes. Thus, a Budget
and a Finance Act are necessary at or about the beginning of each financial year.
Tax changes can be made at other times of the year, however, either by specific
legislation or by the use of the regulator, which permits limited changes between
Budgets in value added tax (by up to 25 per cent) and the main excise duties (by
up to 10 per cent).
The 1986 Budget provided for a cut in the basic rate of income tax—from 30
per cent to 29 per cent—to improve incentives. It introduced the Personal Equity
Plan to encourage wider share ownership. It also aimed to reduce unemploy¬
ment, both through increasing flexibility in the labour market and by means of a
programme of direct help.
The three principal sources of tax revenue are: taxes on income, which include
income tax and corporation tax; taxes on capital, which include capital transfer
tax and capital gains tax; and indirect taxes, which include customs and excise
duties, value added tax (VAT), rates (which are set and collected by local
authorities to help meet their expenditure), stamp duties and licence duties (for
example, on motor vehicles).
Table 35 shows the provisional revenue of central government from taxation
and other sources in 1985-86 and the forecasts for 1986—87.
Taxes on individual incomes are progressive in that larger incomes bear a
proportionately higher rate of tax. Thresholds and rate bands for income tax,
354
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Taxes on
Income
Income Tax

Tax
capital transfer tax and capital gains tax are raised automatically each year in
line with the rise in retail prices over the previous calendar year unless the
Government proposes otherwise and Parliament approves. The Inland Revenue
assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties. The
Customs and Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure (the
customs and excise duties and VAT).
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. For
1986—87 the basic rate of 29 per cent applies to the first £17,200 of taxable
income. A rate of 40 per cent applies to the £17,201-£20,200 band, 45 per cent
to the £20,201—£25,400 band, 50 per cent to the £25,401—£33,300 band and
55 per cent to the £33,301—£41,200 band, ending with a maximum rate of 60
per cent on taxable income over £41,200. These rates apply to both earned and
investment incomes.
A number of personal allowances and reliefs reduce the amount of a person's
taxable income compared with gross income. The main allowances are £2,335
for the income of a single person or the earned income of a wife and £3,655 for
the income of a married man. Among the most important of the reliefs is that for
mortgage interest payments on borrowing for house purchase. Relief at the
basic rate is usually given ‘at source’ (that is, passed directly by the tax
authorities to the building society or bank making the loan rather than to the
individual taxpayer). Another relief is that under the business expansion
scheme, whereby certain investors in trading companies without a Stock
Exchange quotation (usually small companies) are able to obtain relief on up to
£40,000 invested in any one year.
Assuming only the basic personal allowances, a single person with an income
of £10,000 a year in 1986—87 pays £2,223 in income tax while a married man
with the same income pays £1,840. The amount of tax payable by a single
person varies from, for example, £773 on an annual income of £5,000 to
£26,702 on one of £60,000.
The income of married couples is usually taxed as if it all belonged to the
husband. A couple may, however, choose to have the wife's earnings charged
separately for tax on condition that the husband receives the single instead of
the married personal allowance. Any investment income is taxed jointly.
In March 1986 the Government published a Green Paper on the reform of
personal taxation. This discussed the possibility of introducing a system of
independent taxation with a uniform—transferable-—personal allowance. Inde¬
pendent taxation would give married women the same opportunity for privacy in
their tax affairs as their husbands. Transferable allowances would enable
married couples to reduce their tax bill by transferring any ‘unused' portion of
one partner’s allowance to the other partner.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in Britain
(including, from April 1987, the earnings of overseas entertainers and sports¬
men) and on all income arising abroad of people resident in Britain. Interest on
certain British government securities belonging to people not ordinarily
resident in Britain is exempt. Britain has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is often allowed. British residents working abroad
for the whole year benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Company taxation in Britain is at a significantly lower rate than in most other
industrialised countries. Companies pay corporation tax on their profits

payment of corporation tax. In general, this payment is set against a company’s
liability to corporation tax on its income and the recipient of the distribution is
entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies his or her liability to income tax at the
basic rate.
The main rate of corporation tax is 35 per cent, with a reduced rate of 29 per
cent for small companies (those with profits below £100,000 in a year). Marginal
relief between the main rate and the small companies’ rate is allowed for
companies with profits between £100,000 and £500,000. There is a 4 per cent
annual writing-down allowance for industrial buildings and a 25 per cent
writing-down allowance for machinery and plant; short-life machinery and plant
may be wholly written off over its life.
Petroleum revenue tax (deductible in computing profits for corporation tax) is
charged on profits from the production, as opposed to the refining or other
forms of processing, of oil and gas under licence in Britain and on its
Continental Shelf. The rate of tax is 75 per cent. Each licensee of an oilfield is
charged on the profits from that field after deduction of certain allowances and
reliefs which, among other things, encourage exploration, appraisal and future
field development. The tax is computed at half-yearly intervals and the bulk of it
is collected in monthly instalments.
Inheritance tax applies to transfers of personal wealth made up to seven years
before the donor’s death and to transfers relating to property held in most types
of trust. It is chargeable on a cumulative basis over a seven-year period. The
rates of tax are progressively higher on successive slices of the cumulative total
of chargeable transfers. The first £71,000 is exempt; the rates on higher
amounts rise from 30 per cent on the slice between £71,000 and £95,000 to 60
per cent on the excess over £317,000. There is, however, tapered relief for
transfers made between three and seven years before the donor’s death. This
ranges from relief of 20 per cent for transfers made between three and four years
of death to relief of 80 per cent for those made between six and seven years of
death.
Capital gains realised on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax or,
in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is 30 per cent but
individuals are exempt from tax in respect of total net gains of up to £6,300 in
any one year and most trusts on gains of up to £3,150. The effects of inflation
since April 1982 are allowed for when measuring gains. The tax on gifts and
certain deemed disposals of assets may be deferred until the assets are sold.
Certain assets, including the principal private residence, chattels worth less
than £3,000 (and any chattels with a predictable life of less than 50 years except
those on which the expenditure qualifies for a capital allowance), private motor
cars, and National Savings Certificates and Bonds are normally exempt. Gains
on government securities and corporate bonds are exempt from the tax, as are
gains on shares owned under the Personal Equity Plan provided they have been
held for at least one calendar year.
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly based tax, chargeable at 15 per cent. It is
collected at each stage in the production and distribution of goods and services
by taxable persons (generally those whose business has a turnover of more than
£20,500 a year). The final tax is borne by the consumer. When a taxable person
purchases taxable goods or services, the supplier charges VAT (the taxable
person’s input tax). When the taxable person supplies taxable goods or services
to customers, then they in turn are charged VAT (the taxable person’s output
tax). The difference between the output tax and the input tax is paid to Customs
and Excise.

There are two methods by which certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT: one is by charging VAT at a zero rate (a taxable person does not charge tax
to a customer but reclaims any input tax paid to suppliers): the other is by
exemption (a taxable person does not charge a customer any output tax and is
not entitled to deduct or reclaim the input tax). Zero-rating applies to most food;
books, newspapers and periodicals: fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for
road use) and power; construction of new buildings: exports; certain interna¬
tional services; public transport fares; caravans and houseboats; young
children's clothing and footwear; drugs and medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people; and certain supplies by or to charities.
Exemption applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal services, betting,
gaming (other than by gaming machines and lotteries), finance, education,
health, burial and cremation, and supplies by trade unions and professional
bodies to their members.
Oils used for road fuel bear duty at the basic rate. Heavy oil not used for road fuel
and light oil used for furnace fuel bear a lower duty and, except for lubricating
oil, are zero-rated for VAT. Oil used as chemical feedstocks, or otherwise than as
fuel, and most lubricating oils are relieved from duty. There are duties on spirits,
beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry, mainly related to alcoholic strength. The
cigarette duty is based partly on a charge per 1,000 cigarettes and partly on a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other tobacco products is based on the weight
of the finished product. The principal betting duties are the general betting
duty, which is charged at a rate of 8 per cent of the stake money, except for
on-course betting, which is charged at 4 per cent; pool betting duty (which
applies to football pools), charged at a rate of 42-5 per cent of the stake money
(33-3 per cent for charity pools); and bingo duty, charged at 10 per cent.
Revenue is also raised from licences on the operation of gaming machines and
casinos.
The licence duty on a private motor car or light van is £100 a year; for motor
cycles it is £10, £20 or £40 a year according to engine capacity. The licence duty
on goods vehicles is charged on the basis of gross weight and, if over 12 tonnes,
according to the number of axles; the duty is designed to ensure that such
vehicles cover at least their road costs through the tax paid (licence duty and fuel
duty). Taxis and buses are taxed according to seating capacity.
New cars, motor cycles, scooters, mopeds and some motor caravans, whether
British made or imported, are chargeable with car tax at 10 per cent on the
wholesale value. VAT is charged on the price including car tax.
Transfers or sales of property (other than of stocks and shares) above a value of
£30,000 are subject to stamp duty of 1 per cent on the whole of the purchase
price. Transfers or sales of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0-5 per
cent regardless of the amount. Transfers by gift are subject to a fixed 50p duty.
Transfers to charities are exempt.
Customs duties are chargeable in accordance with the Common Customs Tariff
of the European Community (no such duties are chargeable on goods which
qualify as Community goods). Special customs import and export procedures
are operated under the Common Agricultural Policy and Community levies are
chargeable on a wide range of agricultural products from non-Community
countries.
A continuing reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) as a
percentage of gross domestic product is an important part of the Government’s
medium-term financial strategy; the percentage is projected to fall steadily from
PUBLIC FINANCE
359
The National
Debt
2 per cent in 1985—86 to 1 -5 per cent in 1988—89 and 1989—90 (see Table 33). As
part of the policy of controlling the rate of growth of the money stock, the
Government seeks to finance the PSBR by sales of public sector debt to the
public outside the banking system. The outturn for the PSBR in 1985—86 was
£5,900 million compared with a forecast of £7,100 million at the time of the
1985 Budget. Sales of government stock (known as gilt-edged stock as there is
no risk of default) to the non-bank private and overseas sectors amounted to
£5,100 million in 1985—86 and sales of National Savings instruments £2,200
million. Gilt-edged stock is marketable and is traded on The Stock Exchange.
Individuals may also make transactions through post offices in stocks included
on the National Savings Stock Register. Pension funds and insurance com¬
panies have the largest holdings. The Government issues both conventional and
indexed stock (on which principal and interest are linked to the movement in
the retail prices index).
National Savings instruments are non-marketable and are designed to attract
personal savings. Their importance relative to gilt-edged stock as a source of
government funding has increased in recent years. The chief instruments are
National Savings Certificates, Income Bonds, Indexed Income Bonds, Deposit
Bonds, National Savings Investment and Ordinary Accounts, Premium Savings
Bonds and Yearly Plan. In 1985—86 the main contributors to funding were
Income Bonds (£890 million net) and fixed-interest Savings Certificates (£808
million net). The contribution made by net accrued interest from National
Savings as a whole (that is, interest added less that paid out) amounted to
£1,610 million in 1985—86.
The other principal debt instruments of central government are Treasury bills
and certificates of tax deposit. Treasury bills are 91-day bills sold at a weekly
auction to the discount houses, which guarantee to take up the whole of the
offer; certificates of tax deposit are non-marketable and may be purchased by
individuals or corporate bodies to be tendered in settlement of a range of taxes.
The bulk of public corporations' borrowing is met by central government
through the National Loans Fund although their temporary borrowing needs are
met largely from the market, often under Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan Board from the National Loans
Fund. (The Board remains an independent body even though it is merged for
administrative purposes with the former National Debt Office, forming the
National Investment and Loans Office.) The local authorities also borrow directly
from the market, both short-term and long-term, through a range of instru¬
ments. Some public corporations and local authorities also borrow on occasion,
under special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
Net central government borrowing each year represents an addition to the
National Debt. At the end of March 1986 the National Debt amounted to some
£171,000 million of which about £4,000 million was in currencies other than
sterling. Of the £168,000 million sterling debt, £130,000 million consisted of
gilt-edged stock; of this, 34 per cent had a maturity of up to five years, 39 per
cent a maturity of over five years and up to 15 years and 27 per cent a maturity of
over 15 years or undated. The remaining sterling debt was made up mainly
of national savings (£24,000 million), certificates of tax deposits. Treasury
bills, and Ways and Means advances (very short-term internal government
borrowing).
*
18 Banking
and Financial
Institutions
Britain's position as a major financial centre reflects the wide range of
specialised financial services provided. The City of London has the greatest
concentration of banks in the world (responsible for about a quarter of total
international bank lending), the world's biggest insurance market (with about
one-fifth of the international market) and a Stock Exchange with a larger listing
of securities than any other exchange, and remains the principal international
centre for transactions in a large number of commodities. Its tradition of
informal dealing and its position between the time zones of the United States
and the Far East enable it to complete large-scale transactions with economy
and speed.
The financial services sector accounts for 5 to 6 per cent of the total output of
the British economy and for 4 to 5 per cent of employment. The net overseas
earnings of British financial institutions in 1985 were £7,584 million.
Development of
Financial
Services
The increase in the rate of international movements of capital in the 1960s and
1970s took the form mainly of increased bank lending and foreign exchange
trading. London became the international centre of this activity, particularly in
the eurocurrency markets (see p371), and the number of overseas banks
represented in London is larger than in any other financial centre. In the 1980s,
with increasing international competition in financial services and with
developments in technology, there has also taken place a rapid growth in the
international markets for securities. London again has played an important
role, especially in the market for eurobonds, in a variety of currencies (see
p 371). The London Stock Exchange (see p 370) is reorganising itself, partly in
order to adapt to this situation, and has changed its membership rules with the
result that numerous financial institutions in London, both British and
foreign-based, have formed new alliances with each other. A new trading system
for The Stock Exchange is expected to come into operation in October 1986.
To help Britain s financial services industry to respond to the new competitive
climate, while at the same time maintaining adequate safeguards for the
investing public, the Government proposes to establish a new supervisory
framework and associated institutional structure for much of the industry,
under legislative proposals introduced in December 1985. Investment
businesses (those effecting transactions in, managing or giving advice on
securities of all kinds, financial and commodity futures, life assurance, options
contracts and certain other instruments—but not wholesale moneymarket
instruments) will require authorisation and will have to obey rules of conduct
based on principles set out in the legislation. When this comes into force, powers
will be given to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to authorise and
regulate the carrying on of investment business. However, the majority of these
powers will be transferable to a designated agency as long as it meets specified
362
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE BANK
OF ENGLAND
criteria. The agency, in turn, will be able to recognise self-regulatory organisa¬
tions (SROs) provided that they offer investors protection at least equivalent to
that provided by the agency. Both the agency and the SROs will be practitioner-
based bodies: the Securities and Investment Board has already been established
to fulfil the agency role. Membership of an SRO will be one of the ways for
investment businesses to become authorised.
The Government also in late 1985 put forward proposals for improving the
supervision of Britain's banking system and introduced legislation aimed at
widening the range of activities that building societies are able to engage in.
In making these various proposals the Government has made provision for
improved co-operation between supervisors in different financial sectors, while
seeking to avoid any harm thereby to efficiency, competitiveness and flexibility
within the sectors themselves. The Bank of England, H.M. Treasury and the
Department of Trade and Industry have prime responsibility for supervision in
different parts of the financial sector. '
Changes within the financial services sector as a whole are expected to erode
traditional distinctions between financial institutions, with single firms provid¬
ing a broader range of services, both in domestic and international markets.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. The Bank's main functions
are to execute monetary policy, to act as banker to the Government, to act as a
note-issuing authority and to exercise prudential supervision over and provide
central banking facilities for the banking system. It also manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account on behalf of the Treasury. More generally the Bank has a
responsibility for overseeing the soundness of the financial system as a whole.
The Government’s economic policy is based on the medium-term financial
strategy, which aims to achieve a continued fall in the rate of inflation by means
of successive reductions in the rate of growth in the money supply, and thus of
‘money GDP' (the average measure of gross domestic product at current market
prices), over a medium-term period. On behalf of the Government the Bank
conducts operations in the financial markets (see p 370) designed to influence
the trend rate of monetary growth and of interest rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England is responsible for
arranging government borrowing and for managing the National Debt.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
banknotes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern Ireland
banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount
specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by holdings of Bank
of England notes. Responsibility for the provision of coin for circulation lies with
the Royal Mint, a government department.
The Bank is able to influence money market conditions through its dealings
with the discount houses (see p 366), which developed in the nineteenth
century as bill brokers for industrialists. The discount houses hold mainly
Treasury, local authority and commercial bills and negotiable certificates of
deposit financed by short-term loans from the banks. If on any given day there is
a shortage of cash in the banking system as a result, for example, of large tax
payments or heavy sales of government securities, the Bank relieves the
shortage either by buying bills from the discount houses or by lending directly to
them. This permits the banks to replenish their cash balances at the Bank by
recalling some of their short-term loans to the discount houses. The Bank
conducts its operations in such a way as to keep short-term interest rates within
an unpublished band.

INSTITUTIONS
The Banks
Under the Banking Act 1979 deposit-taking businesses require authorisation
from the Bank of England unless they are specifically exempted from the
authorisation provisions of the Act and are subject to the Bank of England’s
supervision.
On behalf of the Treasury, the Bank manages the Exchange Equalisation
Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign exchange,
SDRs (which are claims on the International Monetary Fund) and European
Currency Units (ECUs). Using the resources of the EEA, the Bank may intervene
in the foreign exchange markets to check undue fluctuations in the exchange
value of sterling.
Deposit-taking institutions may be broadly divided into the ‘monetary sector’,
which includes the banks and is supervised by the Bank of England, and those
institutions outside the monetary sector, of which the most important are the
building societies and the National Savings Bank. Within the monetary sector a
further distinction is drawn by the Bank of England, under the Banking Act
1979, between recognised banks and licensed deposit-taking institutions. The
latter include smaller banking institutions providing a range of services too
narrow to qualify them for recognised status, and the majority of the finance
houses (see p 369). In June 1986 there were 296 recognised banks, the main
types being the members of the Association for Payment Clearing Services,
merchant banks, discount houses and foreign banks. The monetary sector also
includes Girobank (see p 365), certain banks in the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, the Trustee Savings Banks (see p 365) and the Banking Department of
the Bank of England. (The Government proposes to abolish the distinction
between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and to make them all
subject to the same Bank of England authorisation and supervisory arrange¬
ments.)
Another useful distinction is that between ‘retail’ banking and ‘wholesale’
banking. Retail banking is mainly concerned with the cash withdrawal and
transmission of deposited funds—the main reason why people keep bank
accounts. Competition between the banks and the building societies in the
provision of money transmission services increased during the 1970s and is
expected to increase further. Wholesale business involves the taking of large
deposits at high rates of interest, the deployment of funds in money market
instruments (see p 371) and the making of large loans and investments. Nearly
all the commercial banks in Britain engage in some wholesale activities and
some, like the merchant and overseas banks, centre their business on them.
Many of such wholesale dealings are conducted on the inter-bank market, that
is, among the banks themselves.
The major retail banks are those with a significant branch network, which offer
a full range of financial services to both individuals and companies, including
the provision of current and deposit accounts and various kinds of loan
arrangements, together with a full range of money transmission facilities.
The dominant banks in England and Wales are the ‘big four’: Barclays, Lloyds,
Midland and National Westminster. The major Scottish banks are Bank of
Scotland, Clydesdale and Royal Bank of Scotland. Following its merger with
Williams and Glyn’s in 1985, the Royal Bank of Scotland is the only bank to have
a significant network of branches throughout Great Britain. Other important
retail banks are the Trustee Savings Bank, Co-operative Bank, Yorkshire Bank
and Girobank. Northern Ireland is served by branch networks of four banks, two
being subsidiaries of British banks and two subsidiaries of Irish banks.
With the growth of the financial services sector since the 1970s, and with a
relaxation of restrictions on competition among financial institutions, the

major banks have increasingly diversified the services they provide. They have
lent more money for house purchases, and have established or acquired
substantial interests in finance houses, leasing and factoring companies,
merchant banks and unit trust companies. In view of proposed reforms in the
securities industry, some banks have in the 1980s established links with
traders in stocks and shares.
The banks provide loan facilities to companies and, since the 1970s, have
provided more medium- and long-term loans than they did formerly. They have
also become important providers of finance for small firms: they have supported
the loan guarantee scheme under which 70 per cent of the value of loans to small
companies is guaranteed by the Government, and some banks have set up
special subsidiaries to provide equity finance for small companies.
The clearing banks also conduct extensive international operations which
account for a substantial proportion of their assets and profits. In addition to
maintaining overseas subsidiaries they are very actiye in the eurocurrency
markets (see p 371).
The sterling deposits of the London and Scottish banks amounted to some
£126,000 million in February 1986, of which £48,000 million was sight
deposits (that is, could be withdrawn on demand) and £78,000 million was time
deposits. Foreign currency deposits were £75,500 million. Total deposits of the
big four banks were: National Westminster £59,400 million, Barclays £44,300
million. Midland £35,500 million, and Lloyds £32,900 million. The total assets
of the London and Scottish banks amounted to some £236,000 million (of which
£147,000 million was in sterling). Sterling advances to British residents
amounted to some £85,000 million, of which £32,000 million was for
individuals. The banks’ main liquid assets consist of balances at the Bank of
England, money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), their holdings of
Treasury and some other bills, and short-dated British government securities.
They also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio investments (mainly
longer-dated British government securities) or trade investments.
The ‘big four' banks operate through some 10,440 branches and sub-branches.
National Westminster has the largest number (3,170), followed by Barclays
(2,870), Lloyds (2,230) and Midland (2,160). Nearly two-thirds of all adults in
Britain have a current account and over one-third a deposit account.
In December 1985 the London-based inter-bank clearing systems were reorga¬
nised to place the administrative responsibilities under the control of three
separate companies operating under a newly formed umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services. These responsibilities had previously
been exercised by the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (which was
replaced in September 1985 by a wider-based representative body, the Commit¬
tee of London and Scottish Bankers). The three clearing companies cover bulk
paper clearings (cheques and credit transfers); high-value clearings for same-
day settlement (automated payments and ‘town clearing’); and bulk electronic
clearings (through Bankers Automated Clearing Services, comprising standing
orders and direct debits). Membership of each of these clearing companies is
open to any bank or financial institution that meets certain published criteria,
which include meeting a minimum volume of transactions in that clearing and
having settlement account facilities at the Bank of England.
In addition to the money transmission services handled by the three clearing
companies, nearly all the major banks (and increasingly building societies) have
substantial networks of automated teller machines or cash dispensers. These
give customers access to cash and other services up to 24 hours a day.

All the major retail banks offer their customers cheque guarantee cards which
entitle holders to reciprocal encashment facilities up to £50 a day. The same
card will also guarantee transactions with retailers up to the same amount.
Credit cards associated with the major retail banks are becoming an
increasingly popular means of payment. Access operates within the Mastercard
world system and Barclaycard within VISA.
Uniform eurocheques supported by a uniform eurocheque card are now
available from all major banks. These standard-format, high-security cheques
may be used to obtain cash or make payments in Britain or overseas. The
cheques are made out in the currency of the country in which they are being
used, with a guarantee limit of approximately £100 per cheque, but without
limit on the number of cheques that may be drawn in respect of a single
transaction.
Girobank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office, provides a wide range of
banking and money transmission services for personal and corporate custom¬
ers, operating through more than 20,000 post offices. It became a clearing bank
in 1983 and in 1985 it became a recognised bank under the Banking Act 1979.
Accounts and transactions are maintained by a central computer at Bootle,
Merseyside, which is linked to a network of regional offices. In March 1986
Girobank had 1-9 million personal customers, with balances of some £535
million; business balances amounted to £484 million. There were about 420
million transactions in the year ended March 1986.
The Trustee Savings Banks (TSBs), originally founded as small local banks in
the nineteenth century, have operated for much of their history under the
supervision of government agencies. The Trustee Savings Banks Act 1985
provides for the TSB Group to reorganise under the Companies Act as a public
limited company and to issue shares.
TSBs provide a wide range of banking services including cheque accounts and
credit services for businesses as well as individuals. The Group has its own
credit card, Trustcard, which operates within the VISA system, and TSB Trust
Company provides a wide range of savings, insurance, life assurance and unit
trust facilities.
There are four individual banks in the Group with about 1,600 branches, 13
million accounts and total deposits of over £10,000 million.
Merchant banks have traditionally been primarily concerned with the accepting
(or guaranteeing) of commercial bills and with the sponsoring of capital issues
on behalf of their customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex
range of activities with important roles in international finance and the
short-term capital markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services
to British industrial companies, especially where mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of
investment holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds. A number of
merchant banks have become part of financial conglomerates offering an even
wider range of financial services than hitherto.
Some 460 overseas banks and financial institutions were represented in Britain
in 1986 through branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and consortia. A
total of 399 were directly represented while 64 were represented only through a
stake in a consortium. Of those directly represented, 64 were from the United
States, 40 from Japan and 150 from Europe. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade
not only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.

Citibank of the United States is expanding its activities in the retail banking
market in Britain and has joined the high-value clearing system (see p 364).
A number of banking institutions have their head offices in Britain but operate
mainly abroad, often specialising in particular regions such as Latin America or
East Asia through extensive branch networks. The major bank in this sector is
Standard Chartered.
The discount houses represent an institution unique to the City of London.
They act as intermediaries between the Bank of England and the rest of the
banking sector, promote an orderly flow of short-term funds between the
Government and the banks, and lend to the Government by guaranteeing to buy
up the whole of the weekly offer of Treasury bills (which are 91-day instruments).
In return for acting as intermediaries, the discount houses have privileged
access to the Bank of England as ‘lender of last resort’*. Assets of the discount
houses consist mainly of Treasury and commercial bills, government and local
authority securities and negotiable certificates of deposit denominated in both
sterling and United States dollars.
Building societies are mutual institutions which raise short-term deposits from
individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw their money on demand or
at short notice, and provide long-term loans at variable rates of interest on the
security of property—usually private dwellings purchased for owner-occupation.
Building societies have grown very rapidly since 1918, reflecting a continued
high growth of owner-occupation. They account for most lending for house
purchase in Britain and in recent years they have overtaken the banks as the
principal repository for the personal sector's liquid assets; over a half of all
adults have building society accounts. The societies have expanded the range of
services to investors, a variety of saving schemes have been established, and a
growing number of societies provide cheque facilities and automated cash
withdrawal systems.
Competition among the building societies and between building societies and
other financial institutions has increased in the 1980s and a system of agreed
rates of interest for loans by and deposits with the societies has fallen into
disuse.
The three largest societies (the Halifax, Abbey National and Nationwide)
account for 45 per cent of the total assets of the movement and the 15 largest for
some 85 per cent. Mergers between building societies are a continuing trend. At
the end of 1985 there were 167 registered building societies with total assets of
£121,000 million; over £26,000 million was advanced in new mortgages in the
course of the year.
The Government has introduced new legislation which would relax some of
the present restrictions and allow the societies to diversify their financial and
housing services. Among these are that up to 10 per cent of a society’s
commercial assets could be used for purposes other than loans on first mortgage
of owner-occupied houses, with up to 5 per cent placed in new types of asset
such as unsecured loans, housing and investments in subsidiaries and
associates. Societies would also be allowed to offer a wider range of banking and
money transmission services (including reciprocal encashment and paying
arrangements with other financial institutions) as well as estate agency,
insurance broking, share dealing, personal pensions and other facilities. There
would also be changes to the arrangements for the prudential supervision of
building societies, including the establishment of a new supervisory commis¬
sion, and provisions allowing a society to convert into a company. The
legislation is planned to come into effect early in 1987.

The National Savings Bank is run by the Department for National Savings and
provides a system for depositing and withdrawing savings at 20,000 post offices
around the country or by post. There are about 18-5 million accounts. Ordinary
Accounts earn interest at 3 or 6 per cent a year (depending on the balance
maintained); the first £70 of annual interest is tax free. Investment Accounts
earn a higher variable rate of interest, which is taxable. At the end of June 1986
the sum of the two accounts totalled £7,400 million. The National Savings Bank
does not offer lending facilities. As with other National Savings instruments, its
deposits are employed to finance the Government’s public sector borrowing
requirement. The other instruments include tax-free savings certificates, which
either pay fixed rates of interest or a (lower) fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking; and taxable Income Bonds, Indexed-Income Bonds and Deposit
Bonds, where interest is paid without deduction of tax at source. At the end of
June 1986 the total amount of money invested in National Savings was £32,000
million.
The investing institutions are those which collect savings and invest them in the
securities market and other long-term assets. The main investing institutions
are the insurance companies, the pension funds, the unit trusts and investment
trusts.
The British insurance industry provides a comprehensive and competitive
service domestically and internationally. It has been estimated that British
insurers handle some 20 per cent of general insurance business placed on the
international market. The London market is the world's leading centre for
insurance where, in addition to the British companies and Lloyd's, a large
number of overseas companies are also represented. It is the world centre for the
placement of international reinsurance and, partly as a consequence, many
British companies have formed close relationships with overseas companies.
Some British insurance companies confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking general business transact a substantial
amount overseas through branches, agencies or affiliated local companies. Over
a half of the non-life premium income of British insurance companies and
Lloyd's is derived from overseas. Insurance companies carrying on business in
Britain are supervised by the Department of Trade and Industry under the
Insurance Companies Act 1982. About 840 companies are authorised to carry
on one or more classes of insurance business in Britain, of which some 160 are
from overseas. The total net assets of these companies were £134,135 million at
the end of 1984.
Around 400 companies belong to the Association of British Insurers and these
account for about 90 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Long-term insurance is handled by some 280 authorised insurance com¬
panies and is also available through certain friendly societies. Some 90 per cent
of this business is transacted through the members of the Association of British
Insurers. Lloyd's underwriters also write short-term life business.
Lloyd's, established in the seventeenth century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its activities were originally confined to
the conduct of marine insurance business, a very considerable world-wide
market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets has been built up. Long-term life and financial
guarantee business is not covered. Lloyd's, which does not accept insurance
itself, is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament, dating from 1871 to
1982.

Lloyd's is not a company but a market for insurance administered by the
Council of Lloyd's, where business is carried out for individual underwriting
members for their own account and risk and in competition with each other and
with insurance companies. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd's
brokers who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriting agents on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, for whom insurance is
transacted with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Council, are permitted to accept
insurance risks at Lloyd's; these and other safeguards give security to a Lloyd’s
policy.
In January 1986 there were some 28,940 underwriting members of Lloyd's
grouped into about 370 syndicates managed at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents
who are responsible for accepting risks and for settling claims on behalf of the
members of their syndicates.
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the insured, are an essential part of the
Lloyd’s market and a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers
specialise in reinsurance business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of
contracts between companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as
London representatives of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act
1977 provides for the registration of insurance brokers with the Insurance
Brokers Registration Council and makes Britain the first country to introduce
self-regulation of insurance brokers. In November 1985, 17,500 individuals and
3,300 companies were registered with the Council. The British Insurance
Brokers' Association, which sponsored the Act, has about 3,800 members.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and reinsurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the governments
of member states and intended to harmonise the legislation of the various
member countries. Directives cover reinsurance, compulsory motor insurance,
freedom of establishment for life and non-life insurers. Community co-
insurance and insurance intermediaries. Britain strongly supports the removal
of national regulations and exchange controls that restrict the creation of a full
common market in services, particularly financial services, within the European
Community.
Virtually all occupational pension schemes are supervised in order to protect the
interests of the members. Pension contributions are invested either directly in
the securities and other investment markets or through intermediaries such as
insurance companies. The market value of assets held by pension funds rose
from £2,000 million in 1957 to about £157,270 million in 1985 when 17 per
cent was in British government securities and 66 per cent in company
securities. The pension funds have grown strongly since 1960 to become a
dominant force in securities markets. Under government proposals to encour¬
age the expansion of occupational schemes and personal pensions, it is
envisaged that both types of provision for retirement will be subject to investor
protection legislation (see p 361).
Investment and unit trusts enable investors in securities to spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management. Investment trusts are companies
which observe certain requirements of The Stock Exchange and the tax
authorities and invest in securities for the benefit of their shareholders. At the
end of 1985 their investments totalled over £17,170 million, of which nearly
one-half was held overseas.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company and

a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell units to
the public and also repurchase them on demand. The sums held must be
invested in securities. The costs of running the trust are met partly by an initial
charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a periodic service
charge which is usually taken out of the trust’s income. Authorisation by the
Department of Trade and Industry is needed before units can be offered to the
public; this is granted only if the trust deed meets the Department’s require¬
ments. Trusts are allowed to hold up to 25 per cent of their assets in shares
traded on the Unlisted Securities Market (see p 371) and certain other secondary
markets; within this total up to 5 per cent may be held in the form of other
unlisted securities. Under the Government’s proposals for the financial services
industry (see p 361), authorised unit trusts will be able to invest in a wider
range of assets in order to allow a greater variety of investment opportunities to
be offered to the public. In April 1986 there were 2-8 million unit holdings with a
total value of £26,000 million.
The specialised institutions are agencies created to meet the needs of specific
groups of borrowers—mostly industrial and commercial—which were not
adequately covered by other institutions. They are to be found in both the public
and the private sectors. Some of the latter were set up with official support but
with financing from banks and other financial institutions. They may offer loan
finance or equity capital.
The main private sector institutions are described below. Among public sector
agencies are the British Technology Group, the Scottish and Welsh Development
Agencies, the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland, the Co¬
operative Development Agency and the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Finance houses are major suppliers of hire-purchase finance for the personal
sector and of short-term credit and leasing to the corporate sector. Some 80 per
cent of all their business is accounted for by the 46 firms which constitute the
Finance Houses Association (FHA). At the end of 1985 credit outstanding to the
members of the FHA was over £20,600 million. Many of the finance houses are
owned by banks, and most of them are licensed deposit-taking institutions.
Leasing companies buy and own plant or equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental. This form of finance grew quickly in
importance in the 1970s, partly because the leasing companies were able to take
advantage of investment incentives to the benefit of customers whose tax
position would otherwise have made them unavailable. The restructuring of
capital allowances in the 1984 Budget, however, is expected to reduce the
advantage of some forms of leasing after an interim period. In 1985 the 73
members of the Equipment Leasing Association acquired assets in Britain
valued at some £5,800 million, which represented about 20 per cent of total
private sector investment in plant and machinery.
Factoring consists of making cash available to a company in exchange for the
sums owing to it. Since the early 1960s factoring has developed as a major
financial service, covering international activities as well as domestic trade. In
1985 member companies of the Association of British Factors handled business
of £4,600 million (representing over 90 per cent of all factoring business in
Britain) and 4,170 companies made use of the Association’s services.
Finance corporations meet the need for medium- and long-term capital
(including venture capital) when such funds are not easily or directly available
from traditional sources such as The Stock Exchange or the banks.

Investors in Industry (known as 3r) supports investment programmes over the
whole range of industry. During the year ended 31 March 1986 the corporation
invested £320 million. Within the last few years it has become increasingly
prominent in financing management ‘buy-outs’, which involve the purchase of
businesses by managing and other staff from their owners. The shares in
Investors in Industry are owned by the Bank of England (15 per cent) and the
individual London and Scottish clearing banks.
Other finance corporations include Equity Capital for Industry, the Agricul¬
tural Mortgage Corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Com¬
pany and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (the last two being no
longer confined to the Commonwealth in their activities).
A number of venture and development capital companies have been formed
since the late 1970s which take equity stakes in small and medium-sized firms.
Many of these companies are subsidiaries of the banks.
i
The main organised financial markets are the securities markets, of which The
Stock Exchange is the most important, and the money markets. Other
important markets in the City of London are the foreign exchange market, the
financial futures market, the Lloyd's insurance market (see p 367) and the gold
bullion and commodity markets.
The Stock Exchange has its main trading floor and central administration in
London. There are also trading floors in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham and
Dublin.
Transactions on The Stock Exchange are undertaken on behalf of individuals
and institutional investors (pension funds or insurance companies, for
example) by brokers who effect purchases or sales with dealers in securities
known as jobbers'. The broking and jobbing functions have been kept separate
traditionally, in what is known as the ‘single-capacity" system. This system is to
be replaced by a new one in October 1986, however (see p 371).
The number and variety of securities (stocks and shares) officially listed on
The Stock Exchange are greater than in any other market in the world and its
turnover of company securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the other
European exchanges combined. Some 6,900 securities are quoted on The Stock
Exchange; at the end of March 1986 these had a market value of £1,247,580
million. About 5,000 securities of companies were quoted including a number of
leading overseas securities. Company issues represent four-fifths of the
securities at market valuation, the remainder being British, Irish Republic and
other overseas government and corporation stocks as well as eurobonds (see
p371). Institutional investors, such as pension funds, now own a higher
proportion of ordinary shares than individuals.
A market in traded options, in the shares of prominent British companies,
enables investors not only to buy options to purchase or sell shares in future at
pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves. In May 1984 trading
began in a stock index option and in May 1985 a currency options market came
into operation.
In recent years the largest market for new issues has been that for British
government securities (known as ‘gilt-edged’ stocks), which have accounted for
75 to 80 per cent of transactions by value. New issues are made on the
Government’s behalf by the Bank of England.
The Stock Exchange has agreed to certain changes which will make it more
competitive internationally. In particular, membership rules were relaxed in
March 1986, permitting wider ownership of Stock Exchange member firms, and
in October 1986 minimum scales of commission charged to the investing public

by brokers are to be abolished, together with the single-capacity system. Dealers
in securities will thus be able to deal both on behalf of clients and on their own
behalf as principals. New arrangements are being implemented to prevent
conflicts of interest from arising in this situation. A new automated system for
share quotations will also come into operation by October 1986. The scale of the
changes taking place has led to their being referred to colloquially as the ‘Big
Bang'.
The securities industry is subject to a combination of statutory regulation,
under competition policy and company law, and non-statutory regulation by the
Council of The Stock Exchange, the Council for the Securities Industry (CSI)
and the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. Under the Government's proposed
regulatory framework (see p 361), the Council of the Stock Exchange is expected
to become a recognised self-regulatory organisation. The CSI was wound up in
1985 and will be replaced by a body with more extensive statutory powers—the
Securities and Investments Board (see p 362). The Takeover Panel will continue
to function as a non-statutory body.
The Unlisted Securities Market, which deals generally in the securities of small
companies unable or unwilling to obtain a full Stock Exchange listing, was
opened in 1980, since when the number of companies with shares traded has
risen from about a dozen to nearly 350. The Stock Exchange also proposes to set
up a ‘third tier' market for securities in small unlisted companies in October
1986. This will formalise trading in a number of securities, mainly those of small
companies trying to raise risk capital, which is currently carried out directly
with securities dealers in the ‘over-the-counter’ market. Limited trading in listed
securities takes place through a telephone-based dealing system, ARIEL, owned
mainly by the ‘accepting' house merchant banks.
The London money markets channel wholesale funds (mainly short-term) from
lenders to borrowers. They consist of a series of integrated groups of financial
institutions conducting negotiations primarily by telephone, telex and auto¬
mated dealing systems, there being no physical market-place. The discount
houses play an important role (see p 366). Money transactions are negotiated
through money broking firms. The main financial instruments dealt in are bills,
certificates of deposit (CDs) and short-term deposits. The bill markets and the
markets on which the discount houses borrow from the rest of the banking
system are often referred to as the ‘traditional’ markets. Newer markets, known
as ‘parallel’ markets, emerged in the 1960s, and include the inter-bank market
and the market in CDs. Since a large proportion of the latter are held by banks
the CD market is effectively an extension of the inter-bank market.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange trades on the floor of the
Royal Exchange. Some 220 banks and other financial institutions are members
of the market, which allows parties affected by movements in interest rates or
exchange rates to reduce their vulnerability. Trading takes place in financial
instruments of differing maturities and denominated in a number of currencies.
The eurocurrency market enables banks to deal in deposits and loans
denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the bank is
situated. Transactions can thus be carried out in eurodollars, eurodeutsch-
marks, euroyen and so on. While Paris is the main centre for the eurosterling
market, London is the main world centre for other eurocurrency markets.
The eurobond market performs a similar service in transferring funds from
lenders to borrowers but over a longer period by means of bonds issued in
currencies other than that of the issuing country. Transactions in both markets

tend to be in large denominations. The markets developed in the late 1950s
following the restoration of convertibility between the major currencies, partly in
order to avoid incurring the costs of exchange control and other regulations. The
participants in the markets include multinational corporations, nationalised
industries, and central and local governments as well as the international
banking community.
The market consists of banks, other financial institutions and several firms of
foreign exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It
provides those engaged in international trade and investment with foreign
currencies for their transactions. The banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
forward delivery in a wide range of currencies and maturities. The forward
market enables traders who, at a given date in the future, are due to receive or
make a specific foreign currency payment, to contract in advance to sell or buy
the foreign currency involved for sterling at a fixed exchange rate. A Bank of
England survey in 1986 showed that average daily turnover on London's foreign
exchange market is about £60,000 million, making it the largest such market in
the world.
Anyone may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the
hands of the five members of the London gold market, who meet twice daily to
establish a London fixing price for gold. This price provides a reference point for
world-wide dealings. Although much interest centres upon the fixings, active
dealing takes place throughout the day. London and Zurich are the main world
centres for gold dealings.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London relate
to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The need for
close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance services
often determined the location of these markets in the City of London. There are
also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and barley), rubber, soya
bean meal, sugar, pigmeat, non-ferrous metals (aluminium, copper, lead,
nickel, silver and zinc), potatoes, gas oil (heating oil) and crude petroleum oil.
The markets are collaborating in the development of new arrangements to
safeguard participants.
In ship brokerage, London's Baltic Exchange is responsible for about a half of
the world’s tramp fixtures; some four-fifths of air-freight broking business is
also conducted there. A freight futures market came into operation in 1985.
Many of the commodities markets are also operated from the Baltic Exchange.
19 Overseas Trade
Although small in area and accounting for only about 1 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fourth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area,
which accounts for about one-third of all trade.
Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the economy for hundreds of
years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century, when the rapid growth
of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by Britain’s development
as an international trading centre. Exports of goods and services in 1985 were
equivalent to about one-third of gross domestic product. Britain is a major
supplier of machinery, vehicles, aerospace products, electrical and electronic
equipment and chemicals, and a significant oil exporter. It relies upon imports
for about one-third of total consumption of foodstuffs, and for many of the raw
materials needed for its industries. Trade in invisibles is also of great
significance to the economy: in 1985 overseas earnings from services were
equivalent to about 30 per cent of those from total visible exports.
VISIBLE In 1985 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £78,100 million and its
TRADE imports of goods at about £80,100 million on a balance of payments basis (see
Table 36). Between 1984 and 1985 the volume of exports rose by 5 per cent,
while import volume grew by 3 per cent. The value of exports and imports
increased by 11 and 7 per cent respectively during the same period.

Commodity Britain has traditionally been an importer of food and raw materials and an
Composition exporter of manufactured goods. In recent years manufactured goods have
accounted for a growing proportion of imports but a declining proportion of
exports partly due to a rising oil surplus. However, the proportion of exports
374
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
accounted for by manufactured goods increased slightly in 1984 and 1985.
Manufactured goods were responsible for about two-thirds of exports in 1985
with machinery accounting for 23 per cent of the total (see Table 37). Chemicals
accounted for 12 per cent. Sectors which have become relatively less important
include passenger motor cars and textiles, the latter accounting for a little over
2 per cent of exports in 1985 compared with 5 per cent in 1970.
The growth in importance of North Sea oil exports is reflected in the rapid rise
in the share of fuels in total exports, from 5 per cent in 1976 to 21 per cent in
1985.
Recent changes in Britain's import pattern are similar to those which have
affected other major industrialised countries, although to a lesser degree. There
has been a large rise in the share of finished manufactures, which accounted for
44 per cent of imports in 1985 compared with 23 per cent in 1970. Since 1962
imports of semi-manufactures have formed a larger part of the total import bill
than basic materials, reflecting the tendency for producer countries to

undertake processing of primary products up to the semi-finished and,
occasionally, the finished stage. The decline in the proportion of food imports (to
some 9 per cent of total imports in 1985 compared with 40 per cent in the 1950s)
reflects the increasing extent to which demand for food has been met by
domestic agriculture as well as the smaller share of expenditure devoted to food.
About four-fifths of Britain’s exports and imports are with developed countries
(see diagram below). In the last 30 years or so trade with Western Europe has
become increasingly important, representing about 60 per cent of Britain's
trade in 1985 compared with about 30 per cent in 1950. Trade with other
Commonwealth countries has declined in importance.
European Community countries accounted for six of the top ten export
markets and for six of the ten leading suppliers of goods to Britain in 1985 (see
Table 38). From 1981 to 1985 the United States was Britain’s largest single
market while the Federal Republic of Germany was Britain s largest single
supplier from 1982 to 1985; in 1985 each accounted for some 15 per cent of total
exports or imports. There have been a number of changes in the trends of
Britain's overseas trade in recent years. The increase in wealth of the
oil-exporting countries during the 1970s led to a sharp increase in their imports
from all sources; by the early 1980s they were taking some 12 per cent of
Britain’s exports. There was then a fall in the capacity of these countries to
absorb imports so that, by 1985, their share of Britain’s exports had fallen to 8
per cent. In 1973 the oil-exporting countries supplied 10 per cent of Britain’s
imports but, with Britain achieving self-sufficiency in oil, the proportion had
fallen to 3 per cent by 1985. Japan now accounts for around 5 per cent of
Britain’s imports, about twice the proportion of ten years previously.

a On an overseas trade statistics basis. Exports are f.o.b.; imports c.i.f.
Transactions on invisible trade fall into three main groups: services (receipts
and payments arising from services, as distinct from goods, supplied to and
received from overseas residents); interest, profits and dividends (income
arising from outward and inward investment and other capital transactions);
and transfers between Britain and other countries.
Invisible trade is of fundamental importance to Britain’s economy; overseas
earnings from invisibles amounted to £80,608 million in 1985. Britain’s
earnings are usually exceeded only by those of the United States and France.
Britain has nearly always earned a surplus on invisibles and there has not been
a deficit since 1947; its surplus is normally second in size to that of the United
States though some way behind it. In 1985 Britain’s surplus was £5,713 million
(see Table 39). The British Invisible Exports Council, which is financed almost
entirely by contributions from the private sector, promotes measures to
encourage invisible trade.
Earnings from services rose in value by 13 per cent in 1985 to £24,253
million; in volume terms this represented a rise of about 9 per cent. Debits, at
£18,441 million, were about 5 per cent higher by value and 2 per cent greater in
volume terms. The surplus on services increased to £5,812 million in 1985, with
improvements in civil aviation, travel, financial services and other services more
than offsetting deteriorations in the government and sea transport accounts.
The surplus on interest, profits and dividends is estimated to have been
£3,400 million in 1985. Earnings on portfolio investment (investment in
overseas securities) rose by about 45 per cent above the 1984 level to £5,459

million, reflecting the continuing growth in overseas investment following the
abolition of exchange controls in 1979 and changes in the method of foreign
currency lending by banks located in Britain.
The deficit on transfers in 1985 was £3,499 million, largely on government
transactions (mainly contributions and subscriptions to the European Com¬
munity and other international organisations and bilateral aid).

Britain remains committed to the open multilateral trading system and to the
further liberalisation of world trade. To this end it has taken a leading part in
the activities of such organisations as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development and has given full support to a new round of multilateral
trade negotiations. Since joining the European Community in 1973, Britain has
conducted its external commercial policy through the Community. Britain has
consistently sought liberalisation of the Community’s internal market and
has been pressing for action to be taken on the harmonisation of technical
standards, the reduction of frontier formalities and the establishment of a free
market in services. The Community’s common customs tariff is, at an average of
7 to 8 per cent, at a similarly low level to the tariffs of other major industrialised
countries.
Tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade have been considerably reduced in the
seven rounds of multilateral trade negotiations completed since 1947 under the
auspices of the GATT, the most recent being the Tokyo Round (1973—79).
Britain participates in these negotiations as a member of the European
Community. In 1982 the GATT devised a programme to liberalise and expand
trade. GATT members also agreed to make determined efforts to ensure that

trade policies and measures were consistent with the principles and rules of the
GATT, and to resist protectionist policies in formulating and implementing
national trade policies. Britain has contributed to the implementation of the
GATT programme, in particular to work on trade in services, which is of great
importance to Britain's employment and overseas earnings. An eighth round of
multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT is in prospect.
There is duty-free trade between those member states which joined the
European Community prior to 1 January 1986. Portugal and Spain joined on
that date; duties on their trade with other Community countries are being
phased out over a seven- to ten-year period. Britain applies the common customs
tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor having any special arrangement
with, the Community.
The Community has reciprocal preferential trading agreements with the
European Free Trade Association countries (Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland), Cyprus, Israel, Malta and Turkey, and non-reciprocal
agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria,
Yugoslavia, and, under the third Lome Convention, a group of 66 African,
Caribbean and Pacific developing countries. The Lome Convention gives these
countries free access (subject to certain safeguards) to the Community for
industrial goods and most agricultural products.
Tariff preference is also given to developing countries (under the Generalised
Scheme of Preferences), the Faroe Islands and the overseas dependencies and
territories of member states.
Britain maintains few restrictions on its international trade. Most goods may be
imported freely and only a narrow range of goods is subject to any sort of export
control.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has progressively removed almost all quantita¬
tive import restrictions imposed on economic grounds. Only about 7 per cent of
Britain’s visible imports are subject to any form of non-tariff restraint and about
80 per cent of imports are admitted into Britain duty free. The few remaining
quantitative restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in view of the rapid
contraction of the domestic textile industry) and stem primarily from the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) under which there exists a series of agreements
covering international trade in textiles, designed to balance the interests of both
exporting and importing countries. The last MFA expired in July 1986.
Negotiations on a renewal for a further four to five years are in progress. All
quantitative restrictions have been removed from imports of goods of Commun¬
ity origin (except for restraints for a three- to four-year transition period on
imports of certain categories of textile product from Portugal and Spain), but
certain internationally recognised restrictions operated by the Department of
Trade and Industry on a few goods such as firearms, ammunition and nuclear
materials continue to apply. Other government departments operate certain
restrictions on non-economic grounds (on goods such as meat and poultry,
animals, birds, bees, fish and plants and some of their derivatives, controlled
drugs, explosives, certain citizens’ band radios and indecent or obscene articles)
for reasons of health, safety, conservation or social policy.
The great majority of British exports are not subject to any government control
or direction. However, there are controls governing exports of military equip¬
ment and industrial goods of strategic significance as well as nuclear products
and certain metals, and metal scrap. There are also controls, for health

certification purposes, on cattle, swine and certain meat exported to another

£16,000 or more (£4,000 or more in the case of British historical portraits);
controlled drugs; British spirits (beverages) in casks of less than 40 litres; and
Common Agricultural Policy products.
The Government assists exporters by creating conditions favourable to the
export trade and by providing information and advice about opportunities for
trade in other countries, services designed to help exporters and improve
exporting practices, and credit insurance facilities.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain's official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assist¬
ance to British exporters in appointing agents and researching potential
markets overseas, help at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in trade missions. It mainly comprises repre¬
sentatives of commerce and industry with personal involvement in exporting,
but also includes representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry, the
Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), and the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office; it operates under the general authority of the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, who is the president.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the regional offices of
the BOTB throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts
of the British Diplomatic Service overseas. The Scottish Export Office (Industry
Department for Scotland), the Welsh Office and the Industrial Development
Board for Northern Ireland (Department of Economic Development) also act as
BOTB regional offices.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department provides credit insurance for about
one-third of the country's export trade and insures exporters of both goods and
services against non-payment by overseas buyers. The main risks covered
include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, governmental action which
stops the British exporter receiving payment, new import restrictions, and war
or civil disturbance in the buyer's country. Cover may commence from the date
of shipment or from the date of contract (at higher premiums).
This insurance may be supplemented by guarantees of repayment given direct
to banks financing exports sold on credit of two years or more, whether in
sterling or in foreign currencies. Alternatively, for contracts over £1 million, the
ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling them to pay on
cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed buying programme of
an overseas country. The banks provide finance against these guarantees. The
ECGD is also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the
commercial market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over
£250,000.
Investment insurance is provided for new British investment overseas against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
The balance of payments statistics record transactions between residents of
Britain and non-residents. The transactions are classified into three groups:
current account (visibles and invisibles); investment and other capital trans¬
actions; and official financing. The balance on current account shows whether
Britain has had a surplus of income over expenditure.

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Capital Flows
Traditionally Britain has had a deficit on visible trade and a surplus on trade
in invisibles and this was again the case in 1985. However, in 1980, 1981 and
1982 visible trade was also in surplus. In 1985 Britain had a surplus on current
account for the sixth consecutive year. The deficit on visible trade in 1985 was
more than £2,000 million lower than in 1984. when performance was more
seriously affected by a dispute in the coal industry. The surplus on invisibles in
1985 was only slightly higher than a year earlier but its composition was very
different. The surplus on services rose sharply in 1985 with improvements in
financial services and travel. The surplus on interest, profits and dividends fell
as net payments on the foreign currency operations of British banks increased.
The deficit on transfers rose with an increased deficit on transactions with
European Community institutions.
A description of visible trade and invisible transactions is given on pp 373—7.

Britain's exchange controls were abolished during 1979 and residents are free to
acquire foreign currency for any purpose including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. Controls on the lending of sterling abroad have also been
removed and non-residents may freely acquire sterling for any purpose. Gold
may be freely bought and sold. The abolition of exchange controls means that
Britain meets its full obligations on capital movements under the OECD Code on
Capital Movements and under European Community directives. The Govern¬
ment welcomes both outward and inward investment. Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports, while providing earnings in the
form of interest receipts, profits and dividends. Foreign investment in Britain
creates employment; introduces new technology, products, management styles
and attitudes; and provides an opportunity to increase exports or substitute
imports. Inward investment is particularly encouraged by the Department of
Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau.
In 1985 direct investment overseas by British residents was £7,307 million.
British residents’ portfolio investment overseas totalled £18,220 million, most
of which was investment by banks located in Britain, reflecting a change in their

At the end of 1985 Britain's identified external assets exceeded identified
external liabilities by £80,400 million; private sector net assets were estimated
at £79,700 million and public sector net assets at £800 million.1
Direct private investment overseas by British residents (investment in
branches, subsidiaries and associated companies) totalled £76,700 million at
the end of 1985 and portfolio investment £100,600 million. At the end of 1981
(the latest year for which data are available) more than four-fifths of direct
investment was in developed countries. One-third of the total was in the United
States and just under one-fifth in the European Community. In terms of
industries, manufacturing accounted for 37 per cent of direct investment
holdings, distribution for 28 per cent, oil for 20 per cent and banking and
insurance for the remaining 15 per cent.
Direct investment in Britain by overseas residents amounted to £40,600
million at the end of 1985 and portfolio investment to £32,100 million. At the
end of 1981 investment from developed countries accounted for virtually all of
overseas direct investment in Britain. Fifty-seven per cent originated in the
United States and 23 per cent in the European Community. Slightly under 50
per cent was in manufacturing industry.

of claims and obligations are included that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of
valuation.
20 Promotion
of Science and
Technology
Britain has for centuries encouraged research and innovation, and its record of
achievement in relation to size of population is in many respects unsurpassed.
This record has been maintained throughout the twentieth century. For
example, fundamental contributions to modern molecular genetics were made
by the working out of the structure of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) by Professor Francis Crick, Professor Maurice Wilkins, and an American
colleague, James Watson, at Cambridge University in 1952. More recent
achievements include the research carried out by Mr Patrick Steptoe and Dr
Robert Edwards which made possible the birth of the world s first test-tube baby
in Britain in 1978, and work on brain and body scanners (based on
computerised X-ray readings, nuclear magnetic resonance or ultrasonics) and
on monoclonal antibodies (used to diagnose animal diseases and which have the
potential to combat human virus diseases). Other notable contributions in
recent years have been made by Professor Dennis Gabor on holography (the
production of three-dimensional images using lasers). Professor Stephen
Hawking on black holes (hypothetical regions of space) and Professor Frederick
Sanger on molecular biology. Nobel prizes for science have been won by 68
British citizens, a number exceeded only by the United States, and Table 42 lists
British citizens who have won Nobel prizes for science (excluding economic
science) since 1970.
Total expenditure in Britain on research and development in 1983 was about
£6,700 million, 2-6 per cent of the gross domestic product. About half was
provided by industrial enterprises, with a significant contribution also being
made by private endowments, trusts and charities. Nationalised and private
sector industries finance their own research programmes, and many run their
own laboratories. Expenditure on industrial research and development in 1983
was £4,163 million, of which £3,637 million was spent by private sector
companies and £526 million by the public sector and by some 40 research
associations formed by groups of companies in a particular sector. The main
areas of expenditure were electronics (£1,463 million), chemicals and allied
products (£735 million), aerospace (£720 million), mechanical engineering
(£290 million) and motor vehicles (£240 million).
The Government finances about half of the total expenditure on research and
development in Britain, of which roughly a quarter is carried out in government
research establishments. Government finance for research and development
also goes to industry and the universities. Considerable expenditure is directed
towards applied research and the development of new or improved materials,
products and processes. In many areas Britain participates in European and
other international projects.

Responsibility for basic civil science in Britain rests with the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, and responsibility for technology mainly with the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, but in all cases the Prime Minister has
overall responsibility. In general, applied research and development is under¬
taken in accordance with the ‘customer—contractor principle’ under which
government departments, as customers, define their research requirements.
The work is undertaken by contractors including government laboratories,
research councils, universities, research associations and industry. Depart-

merits with major scientific or technological needs generally have a Chief
Scientist's organisation, which helps to formulate requirements, select the most
suitable contractors and co-operate with them to obtain the best value for
money.
Advice on scientific and technological matters is provided to the Secretary of
State for Education and Science by the Advisory Board for the Research
Councils and to the Prime Minister by the Advisory Council for Applied Research
and Development (ACARD). A committee of Chief Scientists, under the
chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser, Cabinet Office, is responsible for
co-ordination among departments. These three bodies ensure that scientific
questions are brought before ministers as appropriate and that scientific
priorities reflect those of the Government as a whole.
ACARD (whose members include senior industrialists and academics) pro¬
duces reports on applied research, design and development in Britain; the
application of research and technology, developed in Britain and elsewhere, for
the benefit of both the public and private sectors in accordance with national
economic needs; the co-ordination (in collaboration with the Advisory Board for
the Research Councils) of these activities with research supported through the
Department of Education and Science; and advice on the annual review of
government-funded research and development. It also advises on Britain's role
in international collaboration in applied research, design and development
related to technology.
Total government expenditure on research and development in 1986—87 is
estimated to be some £4,800 million. The largest departmental research and
development budget is that of the Ministry of Defence. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of Education and Science, which
supports the research councils and the universities; the Department of Trade
and Industry; the Department of Energy; the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland; the
Department of the Environment; and the Department of Transport.
Research and development in the Ministry of Defence is aimed at meeting the
needs of the Armed Services. The research programme is undertaken both in the
Ministry’s research establishments and as funded research in industry,
universities and other institutions of higher education. In 1986—87 the Ministry
plans to spend some £2,300 million, of which some £400 million will be for
research and £1,900 million for development. An increasing emphasis is placed
on research funded jointly with industry, and initiatives are also being taken to
promote ‘spin-off from defence technology to the civil market.
Although most industrial research and development is financed by industry, the
Department of Trade and Industry provides support, some £440 million in
1985—86, to stimulate activities which would bring economic benefits but would
not otherwise be undertaken by industry. The main areas of expenditure are
aeronautics and space (some £185 million in 1985—86), while a wide range of
industrial projects, and technology transfer, awareness, training and advisory
activities is also undertaken. The Department has four research establishments:
the National Physical Laboratory, the National Engineering Laboratory, the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist and the Warren Spring Laboratory.
The Department of Education and Science discharges its responsibilities for
basic and applied civil science mainly through the five research councils, to
which it allocates funds from its science budget (£615 million in 1986—87). The
councils and their allocations are: the Science and Engineering Research

Council (£315-5 million), the Medical Research Council (£128-3 million), the
Natural Environment Research Council (£70-3 million), the Agricultural and
Food Research Council (£52-7 million) and the Economic and Social Research
Council (£23-6 million). Science budget grants are also made to the British
Museum (Natural History), the Royal Society and the Fellowship of Engineering.
The allocations provide support for research in the form of grants and contracts
to universities, polytechnics and elsewhere, research units and other establish¬
ments of the research councils, postgraduate support and subscriptions to
international scientific organisations. The Department is also responsible for
some aspects of international scientific relations and helps to co-ordinate
government policy regarding scientific and technical information.
The Department is also the main source of funding for the universities, whose
allocations are determined by the University Grants Committee. Although
individual universities decide upon the allocation of their resources between
teaching and research, the proportion committed to ‘research is generally
believed to be between 25 and 30 per cent.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State on
civil science, particularly with regard to the research council system, on the
support of postgraduate students, on the proper balance between national and
international scientific activities, and on the allocation of the science budget
among research councils and other bodies. It also promotes close liaison
between the councils and users of their research. Its membership includes the
chairman or secretary of each of the research councils, the chairman of the
University Grants Committee, the Chief Scientists from departments with a
major interest in the work of the research councils, the Chief Scientific Adviser,
Cabinet Office, and independent members drawn from universities, industry
and the Royal Society.
Each of the five research councils is an autonomous body established under
Royal Charter with membership drawn from the universities, professions,
industry and the Government. They conduct research through their own
research establishments and by supporting selected research, study and
training in universities and other higher education establishments. They also
receive income for research commissioned by departments under the customer-
contractor principle and from the private sector. Income from commissioned
research is particularly important for the Agricultural and Food Research
Council and the Natural Environment Research Council.
In 1985 the Government announced new arrangements intended to make it
easier for educational establishments to exploit research carried out with the
support of grants from the research councils. Under the arrangements the
rights and responsibility of exploitation will rest with the institution receiving
the grant, subject to the existence of procedures agreed with the sponsoring
research council.
The Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) is responsible for the
support of basic research work and postgraduate training in pure and applied
science (including engineering) outside the areas of agriculture, medicine and
the environment. It encourages active collaboration between higher education
establishments and industry, particularly in areas of national importance,
including the award of studentships to suitable graduates for training in
methods of research or a specialised branch of science or engineering of
importance to British industry.

SERC maintains four research establishments: the Daresbury Laboratory at
Warrington (Cheshire), the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux
(East Sussex), the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, and the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton (Oxfordshire). The establishments are centres of special¬
ised research, and are also used for the development and operation of central
experimental facilities beyond the resources of an academic institution. They
provide support for scientists whose research needs access to facilities run by
international research organisations, such as the powerful particle accelerators
at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva and the
high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) at Grenoble.
SERC provides national contributions to CERN and the European Incoherent
Scatter Facility, and part of Britain's contribution to the European Space
Agency (see p 394). It also contributes to the European Science Foundation, and
shares with its French and Federal German partners the control of the ILL
nuclear reactor at Grenoble. In addition, SERC encourages scientists and
engineers to initiate or extend collaborative projects with colleagues overseas by
using its fellowships, studentships and grant schemes.
Developments in engineering research and training related to the needs of
industry are major concerns of SERC. Some special programmes are being
supported within a general effort to develop research and postgraduate training
in university and polytechnic engineering departments. Among subjects receiv¬
ing major support are information technology (including software engineering,
intelligent knowledge-based systems and device fabrication), radio communica¬
tions, the application of computers to manufacturing, biotechnology, marine
technology, polymer engineering, materials, particulate technology, medical
engineering, combustion engines and coal technology. The Teaching Company
Scheme, jointly sponsored by SERC and the Department of Trade and Industry,
supports collaborative ventures between academic engineering departments
and industrial companies to improve their manufacturing methods and
performance. A network providing an interactive computing facility to universi¬
ties is serviced at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
Britain has a leading position in most major branches of astronomy including
radio astronomy, infra-red astronomy. X-ray astronomy and theoretical re¬
search. In optical astronomy (carried out in university departments and, within
SERC, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh) it is expected to regain its leadership as a result of three optical
telescopes which form the basis of a new international observatory on the island
of La Palma in the Canary Islands. Two telescopes (the Isaac Newton Telescope,
2-5 m in diameter, and the 1-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope) are in use, while the
4-2-m William Herschel Telescope comes into operation in 1987. On Mauna Kea,
Hawaii, SERC has a 3-8-m infra-red telescope, the largest telescope in the world
designed specifically to make infra-red observations, and the 15-m James Clerk
Maxwell radio telescope (which has been built in collaboration with the
Netherlands and is scheduled to open in 1987) for observing wavelengths of less
than a millimetre. Much of the observation will eventually be carried out under
remote control from Britain and the Netherlands using computer communica¬
tions networks. Cambridge and Manchester universities are the main centres
for research in radio astronomy, with substantial support from SERC.
The Starlink network of computer systems, centred at Chilton and located at
many centres of astronomical research in Britain, provides and co-ordinates
image processing and data reduction facilities for use by British astronomers.

SERC establishments concerned with the provision of facilities for university
research in nuclear physics are at Chilton, which supports university teams
engaged in experiments in particle physics at CERN and other overseas centres,
and the Daresbury Laboratory, where there is a 20-million-volt tandem
accelerator for research into nuclear structure. Projects using these and other
facilities are funded through research grants to universities.
Support is provided for high-quality research in biological and natural sciences,
and mathematics. Where experimental facilities are too expensive to be financed
by individual universities and polytechnics, central facilities have been pro¬
vided. For example, the Daresbury Laboratory operates a synchrotron radiation
facility which provides high-intensity electromagnetic radiation used in a wide
range of experiments in materials science, surface physics, crystallography and
molecular biology. Other central facilities include a high-powered laser facility at
Chilton, which is used to study plasmas, and a spallation neutron source, also at
Chilton, to provide a pulsed beam of neutrons.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main government agency for the
support of biomedical research, both at its own centres and by means of grants.
Its major research establishments are the National Institute for Medical
Research at Mill Hill, London, which carries out fundamental research relevant
to medicine, the Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, London,
and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge. The Council also has 53
research units, mostly located in university departments, medical schools and
hospitals in Britain. Its primary objective is to advance knowledge that will
improve the level of health. Major areas of activity include neurosciences,
molecular and cell biology, reproduction and development, and cancer.
The MRC is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurosciences and Mental
Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physiological Systems
and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research Board.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has responsibility for
research in the physical and biological aspects of the natural environment. The
work is divided among three directorates: Earth Sciences, Marine Sciences, and
Terrestrial and Freshwater Sciences. The Council’s research institutes are: the
British Antarctic Survey, the British Geological Survey, the Institute of
Hydrology, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the Institute of
Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of
Virology and the Sea Mammal Research Unit. The Council also operates a
research vessel base and maintains a central computing service in support of all
its institutes.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom and the
Scottish Marine Biological Association. Units based at universities include the
NERC Unit for Thematic Information Systems at the University of Reading, and
the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology at Sheffield University.
Commissioned research accounts for about one-third of NERC’s income.
Contract research is carried out for public authorities, industry and commerce,
both in Britain and overseas, and NERC is able to supply experienced personnel
and material facilities across the spectrum of environmental science. Many
applied projects are in progress overseas, for example, on biological pest control,
regeneration of tropical hardwoods and drip irrigation techniques for tropical
crops.

The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), together with the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, supports a network of
research institutes in Britain collectively known as the Agricultural and Food
Research Service. The Service is involved with research into a wide range of
topics relevant to the agricultural, horticultural and food industries: animals,
plants, soils, engineering, nutrition and food. The results of this research are
applied to increase the efficiency of these industries and those that support
them, including the chemical and engineering industries. However, under the
AFRC’s long-term strategy, greater emphasis is being given to those areas of
science related to agriculture and food, especially human food and nutrition
research. Organisational changes have been implemented to consolidate
research work into eight new institutes, each responsible for one area of
research.
The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) supports research, mainly
in universities, polytechnics and research institutes. Among the research
interests of its standing committees are the competitiveness of British industry,
social change and economic life, information technology and education,
efficiency in government, and the changing urban and regional system. The
Council acts as agent for the Advisory Board for the Research Councils in
preparing a programme of research on science policy, and for the Department of
Trade and Industry in commissioning studies of public acceptance of new
technologies.
Of the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the
academic year 1984—85 (£700 million), the largest government contribution
(£360 million) was through the University Grants Committee.
Scientific research in the universities and other institutions of higher
education is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, almost half of the postgraduate students in science and
technology receive maintenance awards from the research councils, through
postgraduate studentships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up to
three years of training in research work and in others for shorter periods for
advanced studies. Secondly, grants and contracts are given to the universities
and other institutions by the research councils for specified projects, particu¬
larly in new or developing areas of research. The AFRC, MRC and ESRC main¬
tain a number of research units within universities. In addition, the research
councils provide central facilities in their own establishments for use by
university research workers. The other main channels of support for scientific
research in the universities are various government departments, the Royal
Society, industry and the independent foundations.
A number of universities in industrial centres have acquired outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industry and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
Of special interest are science parks, sites containing science-based industries,
which have been designed to facilitate advanced technology through collabora¬
tion between university and industrial scientists and technologists. Britain’s
first science park was established in 1972 at Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh. At the end of 1985 there were some 20 university-based science
parks in Britain, with a further six in various stages of planning. In addition,
there were more than 20 non-university high technology developments similar
to science parks.
There are some 300 tenants on Britain’s science parks, employing about

3,800 people. The parks vary widely in size, scope and management. The
Listerhills high-technology development at Bradford University, on a site of only
6,000 sq m (64,000 sq ft), provides accommodation for 28 businesses, most of
which are involved in microelectronics and computing, which together employ
some 200 people. The Cambridge Science Park occupies a 53-hectare (130-acre)
site, and the 65 tenants are engaged in a wide range of activities including the
manufacture of ultra-violet light sources and pharmaceuticals, and services
such as oil exploration consultancy and venture capital funds. Some 1,700
people are employed by companies on the science park.
Charitable foundations sponsoring research in Britain include: the Cancer
Research Campaign, the Chester Beatty Institute for Cancer Research, the Ciba
Foundation, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Institute for Cancer
Research, the Leverhulme Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation, the Wellcome
Trust and the Wolfson Foundation.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which promote their own disciplines or are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. The Council of Science and Tech¬
nology Institutes has 15 member institutes representing, among others,
biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists, physicists and geologists.
The Fellowship of Engineering, formed from distinguished engineers in the
Royal Society and the leading chartered engineering institutions, advises the
Government and other relevant bodies on all aspects of engineering. It also
arranges lectures, seminars and conferences on matters of national importance
in engineering. The Fellowship was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1983. Up
to 60 leading engineers from industry, the academic world and the public service
in Britain are elected each year and there were 660 Fellows in 1986.
More than 300 learned societies in Britain play an important part in the
promotion of science and technology. Through meetings, publications and
recognition by the scientific community, they help to maintain high academic
and professional standards and facilitate the spread of knowledge. The Royal
Society, the oldest of these societies, is also the national academy of science,
while the Royal Colleges in the various fields of medicine and the Fellowship of
Engineering have similar leading roles in their areas. In addition, the Royal
Society of Arts, the Royal Institution and the British Association for the
Advancement of Science are also broadly concerned with the promotion of
science and technology. In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh, founded in
1783, is concerned with the promotion of science and literature.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in Britain’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous
existence. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows:
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 90; and the main body of Fellows
numbering over 1,000. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is restricted
to 40 people a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments to research
councils (other than the Economic and Social Research Council) and Fellows
serve on most of the governmental advisory councils and committees concerned
with research. The Society is financed through a parliamentary grant
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
391
(£6 million in 1985—86) and through funds from private sources (£3 million in
1985-86).
The Royal Society recognises the highest standards of scientific and technolo¬
gical achievements through its elections to the Fellowship and the award of its
medals and endowed lectureships. It awards 15 medals (not all annually)
including the Copley Medal (its highest award) and three Royal Medals, while
there are eight endowed lectureships. The Society encourages research through
the award of grants and research appointments. It administers 18 research
professorships, of which four are supported from private funds and the
remainder from its parliamentary grant. In addition, over 130 senior research
fellowships and research fellowships are supported in British universities.
Grants for research are made from its private funds and from its parliamentary
grant, and particular funds are available for field research overseas, for travel by
individual scientists, for studies in the history of science and for scientific
publications. The dissemination of scientific knowledge is encouraged by a
programme of scientific discussion meetings and through its publications. It
has an extensive library of works relating to the history of science. The council
gives advice to the Government and other bodies on matters relating to science
and technology and their application, and study groups on particular aspects of
science are established at intervals to prepare reports which are widely
distributed to the scientific community. The Society, jointly with the Fellowship
of Engineering, established in 1986 a Science and Engineering Policy Studies
Unit to undertake detailed studies in areas important to national science policy.
A number of committees of the council, some of them jointly with other bodies,
promote improvements in education in science subjects and links between
industry and higher education.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. As the national
academy of science, it represents Britain in all but two of the 19 international
unions comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions. It is a
member of the European Science Foundation and certain other organisations,
and also plays a leading part in international scientific programmes. It has
agreements for exchange visits by scientists and co-operative research with
many academies throughout the world, and maintains informal relations to
promote scientific co-operation with many other countries; some 3,000 visits
abroad for periods ranging from a few days to two years are supported annually.
The largest formal scheme is the European Science Exchange Programme,
which provides for fellowships (usually of one year) and study visits (lasting
about two months) with 15 other countries in Western Europe.
Royal Society
of Arts
Royal
Institution
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) is concerned with arts, architecture and
design, science and technology, industry and commerce, the environment and
education. Since its foundation in 1754, one of the Society’s principal objects
has been to promote the progress of all branches of practical knowledge, chiefly
by means of lectures and conferences, and by the publication of a monthly
journal designed to enable leading authorities to report on developments of
public as well as specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. It has extensive laboratories
which undertake research on subjects including photophysics, photochemistry,
photobiology, crystal structure and catalysis. Lectures are given to members and
schoolchildren on recent developments in science and other branches of
knowledge; the Institution has an extensive programme of educational activi-

ties, with particular emphasis on encouraging young people to take an interest
in science.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as by
eminent scientists. In addition, the Association plans special lectures, exhibi¬
tions, conferences and discussions, appoints study groups and publishes
pamphlets. The Association has 16 branches and five lectureships for young
scientists (dealing with the physical, biological and social sciences) to encourage
scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences.
The Zoological Society of London, an independent scientific body, runs the
world-famous London Zoo, which occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s
Park, London. The Society also runs Whipsnade Park Zoo near Dunstable
(Bedfordshire) where some 2,000 animals roam a 200-hectare (500-acre) park.
The Society is responsible for the Institute of Zoology, which carries out
research in conservation and comparative medicine. It also organises scientific
meetings and symposia for zoologists, publishes scientific journals and
maintains one of the largest zoological libraries in the world. Other well-known
zoos include those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington,
Marwell (near Winchester) and Jersey. There are also a number of ‘safari parks’
containing wild animals; the public can drive through the parks in closed motor
cars.
The Royal Botanic Gardens (founded in 1759) cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at
Kew (west London) and a 187-hectare (462-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place,
Ardingly (West Sussex). They contain the largest collections of living and dried
plants in the world. The Herbarium is primarily concerned with research into
the classification of plants and the preparation of floras and plant lists as well as
the identification of about 50,000 specimens a year from overseas. A Conserva¬
tion Unit gathers and provides information on endangered species of plant on a
world-wide basis. The study of plant anatomy, plant biochemistry, cytology and
genetics is undertaken in the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew. The laboratory’s plant
physiology section is based at Wakehurst Place where research is being carried
out into seed germination and storage, and a seed bank of temperate and
tropical species is maintained. A wide range of living plants, comprising some
50,000 plant species representing most families, is displayed at Kew.
The Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh was founded in 1670. The Garden
has three outstations, at Benmore (near Dunoon), at Logan (near Stranraer) and
at Dawyck (near Peebles). The large collection of living plants, both out of doors
and in greenhouses, is used for taxonomic (plant classification) and related
research. An important botanical library with over 75,000 volumes is main¬
tained at Edinburgh.
The British Museum (Natural History) is one of the world’s principal centres for
the general study of natural history, particularly for specialised research into
taxonomy. It has five scientific departments: botany, entomology, mineralogy,
palaeontology and zoology. It possesses extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science Museum
illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all countries, but
chiefly in Britain. The geology of Britain is probably known in more exact detail
than that of any other country in the world, and there is an outstanding
collection of exhibits in the Geological Museum. These three museums are in
South Kensington, London. Other important collections include the Museum of

Britain is fully involved in the European Community committees concerned
with the co-ordination of national policies on scientific and technological
research and the implementation of joint projects of interest to the Community.
It is also an active member of the Committee for Scientific and Technological
Policy of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Other
intergovernmental organisations involved in scientific co-operation with which
Britain is concerned include: specialised agencies of the United Nations such as
the International Atomic Energy Agency: European Co-operation in Science and
Technology; the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency:
the European Centre for Nuclear Research; the European Space Agency; the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory; the International Agency for Research
on Cancer; the Institut Laue-Langevin; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa¬
tion Science Committee. Britain is the host nation for a number of major
international scientific facilities, such as the European Atomic Energy Com¬
munity’s Joint European Torus nuclear fusion project at Culham (Oxfordshire)
and the Spallation Neutron Source at Chilton.
Among non-governmental organisations Britain is represented in the interna¬
tional unions comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions (see
p 391). The five research councils, the Royal Society and the British Academy
were founder members of the European Science Foundation in 1974. Since
1968 Britain has signed over 35 intergovernmental agreements with other
countries on co-operation in science and technology or technical co-operation.
These agreements are usually intended to promote mutually beneficial ex¬
changes and are administered by various government departments. Britain has
also played an active part in the Eureka initiative to promote collaborative
projects by European companies in high technology sectors.
There are science and technology sections in the British Embassies in
Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and Moscow, while staff in other British
Embassies and High Commissions also promote contacts in science and
technology between Britain and the countries to which they are accredited. They
serve all central government departments concerned in overseas scientific
affairs, as well as research councils and the Royal Society, which is the main
representative of Britain in areas of non-governmental scientific collaboration.
Substantial use of their services is made by industrialists. Reports from the
embassies on overseas science and technology are disseminated to over 1,000
British companies. Administrative support for the overseas scientific network is
provided by the Department of Trade and Industry’s Overseas Technical
Information Unit.
The British Council (which promotes an understanding of Britain overseas
through cultural, educational and technical co-operation) fosters co-operation
between British scientists and those of overseas countries to promote among
overseas specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its
scientific achievements, and, in the developing countries, to identify and
manage development projects in the technological, scientific and educational
sectors. The Council helps British scientists to visit other countries, makes its
own awards for postgraduate study in Britain by scientists from overseas and
supervises programmes for senior specialists and students who come to Britain
through United Nations agencies or bilateral technical co-operation schemes.
The main tasks of the British National Space Centre (BNSC), established in
1985, are to produce a national space plan, to co-ordinate British space efforts
and to foster the development of space technology. Its staff are drawn from the
394
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defence, the Science and
Engineering Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council and
industry. Government expenditure on civil space research amounts to about
£100 million a year.
Britain is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) together with
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, while Austria
and Norway will become members in 1987. The BNSC is responsible for leading
the British delegation to the ESA. In the ESA’s space applications programmes,
British industry has led the consortia which have developed all of the satellites
for the International Maritime Satellite Organisation and the European
Communications Satellite series leased to the European telecommunications
satellite authority (EUTELSAT). A much larger satellite, Olympus, is under
development and is expected to be launched in 1987. This series of develop¬
ments has been complemented by a national space programme administered by
the BNSC which leads a British industry with advanced and wide-ranging
capabilities, particularly in telecommunications.
In the ESA’s other applications programmes, Britain is developing the main
microwave instrument for an earth observation satellite, ERS-1, to be launched
in 1989. Britain is also participating in the Ariane 4 launcher programme and in
the Columbus preparatory programme. The latter, started in 1985, is designed
to define the European contribution to the international space station proposed
by the United States, and Britain is leading the studies on astronaut-tended
platforms.
The BNSC is also responsible for Britain’s space science programme, funding
British experimenter groups and representing British interests in the ESA’s
science programme. British groups have been selected to participate in all but
one of the ESA’s science missions. The most recent was the mission to observe
Halley’s Comet — Giotto, which used a British-built spacecraft. British groups
have been selected to participate in the ESA’s infra-red observatory satellite
project, which has recently been approved.
Participation in ESA missions is complemented by bilateral arrangements for
space research with other countries, notably the United States through its
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). British groups have
participated in several NASA space science missions, and are currently
developing a payload for NASA’s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Other
collaborations include the development of the wide field camera for the Federal
Republic of Germany’s X-ray satellite ROSAT.
Through these programmes, British experimenter groups have gained an
international reputation for their scientific work, especially in astronomy,
geophysics and climate research.
21 Promotion
of the Arts
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest standards of
professional performance to the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for drama, music, opera
and dance, and festivals held in towns and cities throughout the country attract
much interest. Many British playwrights, composers, film-makers, sculptors,
painters, writers, actors, singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy interna¬
tional reputations. Television and radio play an important role in bringing a
wide range of artistic events to a large audience. At an amateur level, activities
which make use of local talent and resources take many forms: choral,
orchestral, operatic, dramatic and other societies for the arts abound, and
increasing numbers of people take an interest in crafts such as pottery, weaving
and woodwork. Arts activities introduced by the ethnic minorities are also
flourishing, and range from Indian dance to Pakistani poetry and Caribbean
steel bands.
Policies The broad objectives of the Government’s policies for the arts are to assist the
provision and development of the performing and visual arts; maintain and
enhance the collections of the national museums and art galleries; help preserve
objects of importance to the national heritage; and sustain and develop national
collections of literary material, archive and information stores. The general aim
underlying these objectives is to meet the need for public access to, and
enjoyment and appreciation of, the nation’s cultural heritage and talents. The
Government is maintaining existing levels of support for arts activities;
encouraging private funding of the arts by various means including spon¬
sorship; and making the arts more available to people in the regions. National
museums and galleries are encouraged by the Government to increase their
receipts either through trading activities or by making admission charges. An
important concept in its funding policy is the ‘arm’s length principle’ by which
government funds are distributed to arts organisations indirectly, through
bodies such as the Arts Councils and the British Film Institute; this helps to
safeguard against political interference in arts activities.
Administration Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities play an active part, and
a substantial and increasing amount of help also comes from private sources,
including trusts and commercial concerns.
The Minister for the Arts, a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, is
responsible for general arts policy and heads the Office of Arts and Libraries
which administers government expenditure on national museums and art
galleries in England, the Arts Council, the British Library and other national
arts and heritage bodies. Responsibility for the upkeep of ancient monuments
and historic buildings is exercised by the Department of the Environment; the
Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (known as English
Heritage) manages 400 ancient monuments and buildings on behalf of the
396
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Finance
Arts Councils
Secretary of State for the Environment. The regulation of the film industry and
of broadcasting is conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Home Office, respectively. The Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland are
responsible for the national museums, galleries and libraries in their countries,
and for other cultural matters. In Northern Ireland the Department of Education
has responsibility for these affairs.
Local authorities support a wide range of artistic and cultural activities. They
maintain more than 1,000 local museums and art galleries, and some 4,000
public libraries; provide grant aid for professional and voluntary organisations
including orchestras and theatre, opera and ballet companies; and undertake
direct promotions through local arts councils. They also contribute to the cost of
new or converted buildings for the arts.
Arts education in schools, colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres is the responsibility of central government education
departments, in partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies.
Planned central government expenditure through the Office of Arts and
Libraries amounts to some £320 million in 1986-87. About one-third of current
expenditure is being spent on nine national galleries and museums in England,
about a fifth on the British Library and two-fifths channelled through the Arts
Council to support the performing and visual arts throughout Britain. Grants
are also made to bodies including the British Film Institute, the Crafts Council,
certain other museums, and to the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Fund
provides assistance to organisations wishing to acquire, for the public benefit,
land, buildings, works of art and other objects associated with the national
heritage. Additional central government expenditure on arts and libraries in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland amounts to over £100 million.
Planned spending on the arts and libraries by local authorities in 1986-87 is
about £500 million. Some 80 per cent of current expenditure by the authorities
in England is on the public library service, and the remainder on local museums
and art galleries. Following the abolition of the upper tier of local government in
Greater London and the metropolitan counties in April 1986, extra central
government funding totalling £43 million in 1986-87 is being allocated to
support the performing arts, films and museums to replace funding from these
sources.
Industrial and commercial concerns offer a vital and growing source of
sponsorship and patronage to a wide range of arts, including exhibitions,
concerts and opera seasons, and are often advised by the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts and the Arts Councils. The Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme was launched by the Office of Arts and Libraries
in 1984, and in 1986—87 it has available £1-75 million to match new business
sponsorships. The value of business sponsorship is currently some £20 million
a year. Further support is encouraged by tax concessions announced in 1986
which will allow companies and individuals to obtain tax relief on donations to
arts charities.
Two of the most generous acts of private patronage in recent years were made
in 1985: an endowment of £20 million, to be followed by a further £30 million in
subsequent years, was made to the National Gallery by Mr J. Paul Getty II, KBE,
of the United States, and a gift to the nation of a new extension to the gallery
(which is likely to cost in the region of £20 million) was made by the Sainsbury
family.
The independent Arts Council of Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in
1946, is the main channel for government aid to the performing and visual arts.

Its main objects are to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and
practice of the performing and visual arts, increase their accessibility to the
public, and advise and co-operate with government departments, local authori¬
ties and other organisations. The Council gives financial help and advice to
organisations ranging from the major opera, dance and drama companies,
orchestras and festivals, to small touring theatres and experimental groups. It
encourages such interests as contemporary dance, mime, jazz, literature,
photography and art films, and helps professional creative writers, choreo¬
graphers, composers, artists and photographers through a variety of schemes. It
also promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and drama companies
and of contemporary music groups, and provides funds for some specialist
training courses in the arts.
Under a development programme for the next decade, launched in 1984, the
Council is increasing its funding of the arts in the regions. In the first five years
support for new activities is being concentrated in five main areas of the
arts—art, dance, drama, music and education—focusing on 13 main centres of
population throughout England. Increased funding and responsibilities are also
being given to the regional arts associations (see below).
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies through the
Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils, which are committees of the Arts Council of
Great Britain with a large measure of autonomy. Northern Ireland has an
independent Arts Council with aims and functions similar to those of the Arts
Council of Great Britain.
Following the abolition of the Greater London Council, the Arts Council of
Great Britain assumed responsibility for London’s South Bank arts centre.
Regional co-operation in development of the arts is encouraged through 15
regional arts associations in England and Wales, which bring together all those
in a region, ranging from local authorities and private companies to local artists,
with an interest in improving the artistic life of their area. Their aim is to ensure
that the arts are more widely available and that artists receive support at
regional as well as national level. They offer financial assistance to artists and
arts organisations, and advise on, and in some eases promote, activities. They
are financed mainly by the Arts Council, the British Film Institute, the Crafts
Council and local authorities, and these interests are represented on their
governing bodies. Business sponsorship is also an increasingly important
source of regional funds.
About 220 arts centres in Britain provide opportunities for enjoyment of and
participation in a range of arts activities. Amateur activities are supported by
resident professional staff. The centres are supported mainly by regional arts
associations and local authorities with some help from the Arts Council and
other organisations. Many theatres and art galleries also provide a focal point for
the community by offering facilities for other arts.
Local arts councils in towns and communities throughout Britain, some of them
founded and supported by local authorities, seek to promote and co-ordinate
arts activities in their localities. Industrial and commercial interests also give
financial help.
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature
overseas and maintains libraries in many of the 80 or so countries in which it is
represented. The Council may initiate or support overseas tours by British
theatre companies, orchestras, choirs, and opera and dance companies, as well
as by individual actors, musicians and artists. It promotes fine arts and other

exhibitions overseas, organises British participation in international exhibi¬
tions and film festivals, maintains film libraries in many of the countries in
which it works, and encourages professional interchange in all cultural fields
between Britain and other countries.
Both BBC radio and television and the independent television companies
broadcast a wide variety of drama (including adaptations of novels and stage
plays), opera, ballet, and music, and general arts magazine programmes and
documentaries. These have won many international awards at festivals such as
the Prix Italia and Montreux International Television Festivals. Independent
television companies also make grants for the promotion of the arts in their
regions.
The BBC has orchestras employing many of Britain's full-time professional
musicians, and each week it broadcasts nearly 100 hours of classical and other
music (both live and recorded) on its Radio 3 channel. Radios 1 and 2 broad¬
cast popular and light music. The BBC regularly commissions new music, par¬
ticularly by British composers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and
festivals.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for the 240 professional arts
festivals which take place in Britain each year. The Edinburgh International
Festival, featuring a wide range of different arts, is the largest of its kind in the
world and celebrated its fortieth anniversary in 1986. Well-known festivals
concentrating on music include the Three Choirs Festival, which has taken
place annually for more than 250 years in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the
Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Among others catering for a number of art forms
are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Llangollen International Musical
Eisteddfod and the festivals in Belfast, Buxton, Malvern, Chichester, Harrogate,
Salisbury, Windsor and York.
Britain is one of the world's foremost countries for theatre, and has a long and
rich dramatic tradition. As well as companies based in London and other major
cities and towns, numerous touring companies visit a wide range of theatres,
festivals and other venues throughout Britain including arts and sports centres
and working men's clubs. Contemporary British playwrights who have received
international recognition include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Alan Ayck¬
bourn, Caryl Churchill and David Edgar. The musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber,
such as Cats and Evita, have enjoyed considerable success both in Britain and
overseas. Among the best-known directors are Sir Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Peter
Brook, John Schlesinger and Terry Hands, while the many British performers
who enjoy international reputations include Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Lord
(formerly Sir Laurence) Olivier, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Vanessa
Redgrave, Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons and Glenda Jackson.
British designers such as John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are inter¬
nationally recognised.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for professional use which can seat
between 200 and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned, but most are owned
either municipally or by non-profit-distributing organisations. About 50 ol
these house resident theatre companies which receive subsidies from the Arts
Council. London is the main focus with a hundred or so West End and suburban
theatres, 12 of which are permanently occupied by subsidised companies. These
include the National Theatre, which stages a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoria in the South Bank arts centre; the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which, while also performing in Stratford upon Avon, produces plays

mainly by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, as well as modern work, in its
two auditoria in the City’s Barbican Centre: and the English Stage Company at
the Royal Court Theatre, which produces the work of the most talented new
playwrights.
Outside London most cities and many large towns have at least one theatre;
some, like the Palace Theatre, Manchester, and the Theatre Royal, Nottingham,
date from the nineteenth century and have been handsomely restored. Others,
like the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, and the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been
built to the latest designs. Some universities such as those in Aberystwyth,
Exeter and Newcastle upon Tyne have theatres which house professional
companies playing to the general public. Most regional repertory companies
mount about eight to ten productions a year; some also have studio theatres in
addition to the main auditorium, where they present new or experimental
drama and plays of specialist interest. Repertory theatres also frequently serve
the function of a social centre and meeting place by offering a wide range of
events such as concerts, poetry recitals and exhibitions, and by providing
restaurants, bars and theatre shops. Successful productions from regional
theatre companies often transfer to London's West End, while the largest
regional theatres receive visits from the National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
A number of companies provide theatre for young audiences. Unicorn Theatre
for Young People and Polka Children's Theatre, both in London, produce plays
specially written for children, and the Whirligig Theatre tours throughout the
country. The Young Vic Company in London and Contact Theatre Company in
Manchester produce plays for young people. There are numerous Theatre-in-
Education companies which perform in schools for all age ranges and abilities.
Some of these companies operate independently (such as Theatre Centre, which
plays in London and tours further afield), while others are attached to regional
repertory theatres such as the Belgrade in Coventry and the Playhouse in Leeds.
Most regional repertory theatres also mount occasional productions aimed at
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket prices for those at school, college
or university are generally available. There are also a number of puppet
companies.
Both the National Youth Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth Theatre in
Edinburgh offer early acting opportunities to young people.
Training for actors and stage managers is provided mainly in drama schools,
among which the best known are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Drama,
and the Drama Centre (all in London), and the Bristol Old Vic School, the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (Glasgow) and the Manchester
Polytechnic School of Drama. There are a number of theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, which train designers for the stage. Several
universities, polytechnics and other colleges offer courses in drama.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies throughout Britain.
Their work is encouraged by a number of bodies, such as the British Theatre
Association, the Central Council for Amateur Theatre, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. Amateur companies sometimes receive financial sup¬
port from local government, regional arts associations and other bodies.
The widespread interest in classical music in Britain is reflected in the large
audiences at choral and orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, dance

and chamber music. Rock and pop music are extremely popular, especially
among younger people, while folk music, jazz, light music and brass bands also
have substantial followings.
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are promoted every year in many of the
large towns and cities. The principal concert-halls in central London are the
Royal Festival Hall, next to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room accommodating smaller-scale performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences); the Royal Albert Hall, where the
world-famous seasons of BBC Promenade Concerts are given each summer; the
Wigmore Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony (resident at the Barbican Centre), the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Sym¬
phony, and the Ulster and the Scottish National Orchestras. The BBC’s six
orchestras provide broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There
are also specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English
Chamber Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the Academy of
Ancient Music, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle
upon Tyne), the Scottish Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. The
London Sinfonietta specialises in performing contemporary music. Groups
playing authentic early instruments attract interest throughout the country.
British conductors such as Sir Colin Davis, Sir Neville Marriner and Simon
Rattle reach a wide audience through their recordings as well as by their
performances, and the works of living composers such as Sir Michael Tippett
and Peter Maxwell Davies enjoy international acclaim. The Master of the Queen’s
Music, Malcolm Williamson, holds an office within the Royal Household with
responsibility for organising and writing music for state occasions.
The principal choral societies include the Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society,
the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have close links with
particular choirs. The English tradition of church singing is represented by
choirs such as those of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ Church
Cathedral, Oxford. There are many male-voice choirs in Wales and in certain
parts of England.
Among the characteristics of modern pop and rock music are the diversity of
styles, the frequency with which new styles and stars emerge, and the short
lifespan of many groups. Electric guitars and drums usually provide the
instrumental basis, but there has been an increasing use of brass instruments,
while many groups have adopted synthesisers. In the 1960s and 1970s groups
such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd
achieved international success. British groups continue to have enormous
appeal to audiences throughout the world and often set new trends in music;
some of the more recent groups to have achieved renown are Dire Straits,
Culture Club, Duran Duran and Simple Minds. Well-known performers include
David Bowie, Elton John and Paul McCartney. In recent years black British
musicians have made a large contribution to the development of popular music.
Jazz has an enthusiastic following in Britain and is played in numerous clubs
and public houses. British musicians such as Barbara Thompson, Stan Tracey,
John Surman and Kenny Wheeler have established strong reputations through-

out Europe. Festivals of jazz music are held annually at Camden (London) and
Bracknell (Berkshire) and at a number of other places.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London. The Royal Opera and Royal Ballet, which rank among the
world’s finest companies, are supported by a permanent orchestra. Seasons of
opera in English are given by the English National Opera at the London
Coliseum and their wide range of productions receive much critical acclaim.
Sadler's Wells Theatre is the home of Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet and the New
Sadler’s Wells Opera Company, and stages many of the London performances of
visiting opera and dance companies. Scottish Opera has regular winter seasons
at the Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in Scotland and northern
England. Welsh National Opera has seasons in Cardiff and other cities and, with
Kent Opera and Opera 80, provides most of the touring productions in England.
Opera North, based in Leeds, undertakes tours in the north of England. Opera
in Northern Ireland is promoted by Opera, Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international casts are specially assembled is held
every summer at Glyndebourne in Sussex; this is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera using different casts.
Dance companies also include: London Festival Ballet, which divides its
performances almost equally between London and the regions; Ballet Rambert
(Britain's oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading modern
dance company); Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow; London Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively); and Northern Ballet Theatre, based in
Manchester, which also tours widely throughout England. A number of modern
dance groups are supported by regional arts associations and about 30 small
dance and mime groups by the Arts Council. The three Arts Councils also
support individuals and offer commissions to small groups.
Professional training in music is given mainly at colleges of music. The leading
London colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity College of Music. Outside
London the main centres include the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, the
Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff, and the Birmingham School of
Music. The National Opera Studio provides advanced training courses. The
leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Ballet Rambert School and
the London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools,
have helped in raising British dance to its present high standard. Dance is now
a subject for degree studies at the Laban Centre, the University of Surrey and
Dartington College.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendance by young people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Special performances of orchestral music for children include the
Robert Mayer Concerts, held in London on Saturday mornings. Ludus Dance in
Education Company and Outreach (in the north of England) work mainly with
young people. Scottish Ballet Steps Out works in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestras of Great Britain, of Scotland and of Wales and other
youth orchestras are noted for their high standards. Nearly a third of the players
in the European Community Youth Orchestra come from Britain. There is also a
National Youth Jazz Orchestra.

Support for the
Film Industry
British Film
Institute
The British film industry is widely acknowledged to have undergone a revival in
the early 1980s. British films, actors and the creative and technical services
which support them have been achieving notable successes commercially and in
international film festivals and other events. Besides feature films, including
co-productions with other countries, the industry produces films for television
as well as promotional, advertising, industrial, scientific, educational and
training films.
There are about 1,300 cinema screens in Britain and estimated attendances
in 1985 amounted to some 64 million. Cinema attendance figures declined
rapidly between the mid-1950s and the early 1980s: in 1954 the average weekly
cinema audience was some 25 million, but by 1984 it was about 4 per cent of
that figure. Major reasons for the general decline have been competition from
television viewing, the rapid rise in the use of home video-cassette recorders,
and the effect of the economic recession on the spending power of a
predominantly young cinema-going public. Attendances have started to rise
again, however, since 1984. There has been a growth in recent years in the
number of grant-aided regional film theatres and film societies offering
alternative programmes to those of the commercial cinema chains.
British Film Year, a major initiative by the film industry, fully supported by
the Government, was launched in April 1985. Its main aims were to encourage
cinema-going as the best way to see films, develop the use of films as a medium
of education, highlight Britain's great national assets as a film-making country
and promote British films and film-making ability overseas. During the year
attendances at cinemas increased by more than one-third.
Following a wide-ranging review of the film industry, measures were taken by
the Government in 1985 to remove certain statutory controls on cinemas which
had become outdated and which were no longer contributing to the industry’s
development. The Eady levy, a statutory levy raised from exhibitors on revenues
received from cinema admissions, was abolished and future funding was
secured for the various bodies which had benefited from the proceeds of the levy
in recent years.
The National Film Finance Corporation, which had been funded from the
Eady levy, was replaced by a private body, the British Screen Finance
Consortium, whose members are drawn from the film, television and video
industries. The consortium, investing its own money together with contribu¬
tions from the Government amounting to £10 million over five years, part-
finances the production of low- and medium-budget films involving largely
British talent and encourages the early stages of film project development and
the production of short films.
An annual government grant of some £9 million is also made to the British
Film Institute.
The development of film and television as an art form is promoted by the British
Film Institute, founded in 1933, and in Scotland by the Scottish Film Council.
The Institute offers direct financial and technical help through its Film
Production Board to new and experienced film-makers who cannot find support
elsewhere, and helps to fund film and video workshops in liaison with the
Channel Four Television Company. It administers the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, and has a library from which films and
video-cassettes may be hired. The Institute's Information Division has extensive
international collections of books, periodicals, scripts, stills and posters. It
offers an information service on all aspects of film and television, and produces a
range of publications, including the British National Film and Video Catalogue,
which records films and video-cassettes available in Britain, and a quarterly

journal. Sight and Sound. The Education Department produces study materials
and offers an advisory service to the growing number of teachers of film and
television at all levels of formal education and in adult education.
The National Film Archive contains over 75,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, and over 10,000 television programmes. The
National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical,
artistic or technical interest, and is unique in offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films. Each autumn it mounts the London Film Festival, at which about 150 of
the finest new films from all over the world are screened.
The British Film Institute has promoted and helps to fund the development of
some 40 regional film theatres, and is involved in establishing film and
television centres with a range of activities and facilities in a number of major
cities. It also co-operates with the regional arts associations and grant-aids their
film activities. In Wales, the Welsh Arts Council acts as the Institute’s agent. In
Scotland, the Scottish Film Council supports regional film theatres, administers
the Scottish Film Archive, and promotes and provides material for media
education. Together with the Scottish Arts Council, it set up the Scottish Film
Production Fund, which makes grants towards film production in Scotland.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
The Children's Film and Television Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films specially designed for children. In view of the rapid decline
of the children's matinee movement (only some 50 cinemas now provide
programmes for children on Saturday mornings) the Foundation's films are
increasingly shown through the medium of video and television.
The National Film and Television School, financed jointly by the Government
and the film and television industry, offers courses for writers, directors,
producers and camera technicians. Training in film production is also given at
the London International Film School, the Royal College of Art, and at some
polytechnics and other institutions.
Cinemas showing films to the public must be licensed by local authorities,
which have a legal duty to prohibit the admission of children under 16 to
unsuitable films, and may prevent the showing of any film. In considering the
suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an indepen¬
dent body, the British Board of Film Classification, to which films and also
videos offered to the public must be submitted. The Board was set up on the
initiative of the cinema industry to ensure that a proper standard was
maintained in films offered to the public. It does not use any written code of
censorship, but may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are put into one of five
categories: U meaning universal—suitable for all; PG, meaning parental
guidance, in which some scenes may be unsuitable for young children; 15 and
18, for people of not less than 15 and 18 years of age respectively; and Restricted
18, for restricted showing only at segregated premises to which no one under 18
is admitted—for example, licensed cinema clubs. There is a similar system of
classification for videos.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants
for municipal museums and galleries, funding for living artists channelled
through the Arts and Crafts Councils, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design
and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.

Museums and
Art Galleries
Museums
Association
National
Collections
All national museums and galleries are financed mainly from government
funds. They are free to levy entrance charges to their permanent collections,
special exhibitions and outstations at their discretion. Government policy is to
give priority to the conservation of the buildings and collections of the national
institutions rather than to increasing purchase grants for acquisitions. All the
national collections in England, Scotland and Wales are administered by
independent trustees. Museums and art galleries maintained by local authori¬
ties, universities and private benefactions may receive help in building up their
collections through annual government grants administered by the Museums
and Galleries Commission (for England and Wales) and the National Museums of
Scotland. Financial and practical assistance to both national and local
museums and galleries is also given by the Arts Council and by trusts and
voluntary bodies including the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the National
Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society. Pre-eminent works of
art accepted by the Government in place of capital transfer tax are allocated to
public galleries. Financial help may also be available from the government-
financed National Heritage Memorial Fund; in recent years, the Fund has
made important contributions towards pictures purchased by the Birmingham,
Leeds and Manchester City Art Galleries, and by the national galleries and
museums.
The Arts Council maintains its own collection of contemporary British art,
and organises or offers grants or guarantees for a variety of exhibitions
throughout the country. It runs the Hayward and Serpentine galleries in London
and supports a number of art and photography galleries in London and the
regions, such as the Arnolfini in Bristol and the Museum of Modern Art in
Oxford. The Council also provides support for artists and photographers
through purchasing, and commissioning fellowships and residences. Grant aid
is also available to support art and photography books and magazines. Similar
support is given by the Scottish Arts Council to galleries in Scotland such as the
Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. The Welsh and Northern Ireland Arts
Councils have galleries in Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors and painters have high international
reputations, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. Among the best known are Henry Moore. Elisabeth
Frink, Francis Bacon and David Hockney.
Over 1,000 museums and art galleries are open to the public, including the
major national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions. Nearly 18 million people visited the national galleries and
museums in England in 1985.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Museums and Galleries
Commission, which also promotes co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Nine area museum councils provide technical services and advice
on conservation, display, documentation and publicity.
The independent Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries
and their staffs belong and which also has many overseas members, is a
focus for the collection of information and discussion of matters relating to
museum administration, and a training and examining body for professional
qualifications.
The national museums and art galleries, which are mostly located in London,
contain some of the world's most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest. They are the British
Museum (including the Museum of Mankind), the British Museum (Natural

Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the National
Maritime Museum, the Wallace Collection, the Geological Museum and a group
of museums and galleries on Merseyside. Some of the museums in London have
branches outside London, examples being the National Railway Museum (York)
and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (Bradford) which
are part of the Science Museum.
New developments planned or in progress at the Tate Gallery include the
building of an extension to house the large collection of paintings bequeathed to
the nation by the nineteenth-century artist J. M. W. Turner, and the opening of
an outstation in Liverpool, to be called Tate in the North. An extension to the
National Gallery, to be financed by private funds (see p 396), has also been
announced. A national theatre museum is to be opened in 1987 in Covent
Garden, London.
In Scotland the national collections are the National Museums of Scotland
(formed by the bringing together in October 1985 of the Royal Scottish Museum
and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and embracing the
Scottish United Services Museum in Edinburgh Castle) and the National
Galleries of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The
National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St Fagan's Castle where
the Welsh Folk Museum is housed, an Industrial and Maritime Museum in
Cardiff s dockland, the Museum of the Woollen Industry at Drefach Felindre, and
the North Wales Quarrying Museum at Llanberis. Northern Ireland has two
national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down.
Other important collections in London include the Royal Armouries in the Tower
of London, the Museum of London, Sir John Soane’s Museum, the Courtauld
collection and the London Transport Museum. The Queen's Gallery in Bucking¬
ham Palace has exhibitions of pictures from the extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local authorities but sometimes by local
learned societies or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge are
rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities, such as the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the world, and the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Many private art collections in historic
family mansions, including those owned by the National Trusts, are open to the
public, while an increasing number of open air museums depict the regional life
of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for example, the Weald and
Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England Open Air Museum in
Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire). Among the newest
museums to have been established are the National Horseracing Museum at
Newmarket, the Jorvik Viking Centre, a reconstruction of the Viking settlement
in York, and a new maritime museum in Portsmouth, housing the restored
wreck of the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, which sank in 1545 and was
raised in 1982. The new Burrell gallery in Glasgow houses a world-famous
collection of tapestries, paintings and objets d art. A new Museum of the Moving
Image, due to open on the South Bank of the Thames in 1987, will feature
exhibitions of moving images ranging from ancient shadow plays, through
television and video, to images produced using optic fibres and lasers.
Apart from their permanent collections, most museums and galleries stage
temporary exhibitions on particular themes. There are also a number of national
art exhibiting societies, the most famous of which is the Royal Academy of Arts
406

at Burlington House. The Academy holds an annual Summer Exhibition, in
which the works of hundreds of professional and amateur artists are included,
and important exhibitions of foreign art. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are also children’s exhibitions,
including the National Exhibition of Children's Art.
Government aid for the crafts, amounting to almost £2 million in 1986—87, is
administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Council. The Council holds
regular exhibitions at its London gallery (which also houses a crafts resource
centre, including a slide library) and publishes Crafts magazine, books on crafts
subjects, and slides. It runs a number of grant, loan and bursary schemes to
help people at different stages in the development of their art and is involved in
promotional and marketing schemes. The Council runs activities in education
and manages a British crafts shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Funding
is given to the Welsh Arts Council and the regional arts associations in England
for the support of crafts activities, and also to the British Crafts Centre, a
membership organisation for craftsmen and craftswomen which holds exhibi¬
tions and sells work through its London gallery.
Scotland receives a separate government grant which is administered by the
Crafts Consultative Committee of the Scottish Development Agency.
Most practical education in art and design is provided in colleges of art (of which
the most famous are the Slade School and the Royal College of Art, both in
London), further education colleges and private art schools. Four art colleges in
London were merged in January 1986 with other colleges to form the London
Institute. Degrees at postgraduate level are awarded by the Royal College of Art.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions.
Courses at universities and polytechnics concentrate largely on academic
disciplines such as the history of art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the University of London and the
Department of Classical Art and Archaeology at University College, London. Art
has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through Art
encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original works of
art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition.
London is a major centre for the international art market, and sales of works of
art take place in the main auction houses (two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through private dealers. Certain items are
covered by export control. These are: works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £16,000 or more (£4,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits); and photographic material over 60 years old and worth
£400 or more apiece. A licence is required before such items can be exported,
but this is granted automatically in the case of objects imported into Britain
within the last 50 years. The application for a licence is considered by the
Department of Trade and Industry, and, if the Department’s expert advisers
recommend the withholding of a licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee considers a work to
be of national importance it can advise the Government to withhold the export
licence for a specified time to give a public museum or art gallery an opportunity
to buy at a fair price.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools and of most
colleges and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
private libraries and several private literary societies. Book reviews are featured

in the press and on television and radio and there are numerous periodicals
concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is provided
by a number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith & Son, and
Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage young writers include those of the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory Trust Fund. Many
British writers are internationally recognised and in 1983 the Nobel prize for
literature was awarded to the novelist William Golding. Other well-known living
authors are Graham Greene, Anthony Burgess, Margaret Drabble and Iris
Murdoch, while distinguished British poets include Ted Hughes, Seamus
Heaney and Gavin Ewart. Ted Hughes is Poet Laureate, a member of the Royal
Household who writes verse to mark royal occasions in return for a small
stipend.
A public lending right scheme, introduced in 1982, gives registered authors
the right to receive payment from a central fund (totalling £2-75 million in
1986—87) for the use of their books borrowed from public libraries.
The author of any original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is
automatically protected by the Copyright Act 1956 and its related international
conventions1 from the unauthorised reproduction of the work both before and
after publication. The author of the work is the first owner of the copyright, and
the normal term of copyright in published original works is the life of the author
and a period of 50 years after his or her death.
Societies to promote literature include the English Association and the Royal
Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the British Academy) is the leading
society for humanistic studies.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, the largest of which is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies, such as the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry
readings and recitals. There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as
the Poetry Book Society, which distribute selected new books to their members.
The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and ranks with
the National Library of Congress in Washington and the Bibliotheque Nationale
in Paris as one of the world’s greatest libraries. Publishers have a legal obligation
to supply the Library with a copy of each new book, pamphlet or newspaper
published in Britain. The Humanities and Social Sciences division provides
comprehensive information and reference services based on its world-famous
collections of some 12 million items of monographs, manuscripts, maps,
stamps, newspapers and recorded sound. The Library's exhibition galleries are
housed in the British Museum building, where many of the Library’s greatest
treasures are on permanent display and temporary exhibitions are regularly
mounted.
The British Library Science, Technology and Industry division comprises the
Document Supply Centre in West Yorkshire and the Science Reference and
Information Service in London. The former operates a rapid postal inter-library
lending service of journals and photocopies and satisfies some 3 million
requests each year. It also has access to many millions of books in other libraries
and is the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain and between

Britain and countries overseas. The Science Reference and Information Service
is Western Europe’s most comprehensive collection of material on modern
science and technology and holds patent specifications. It provides a referral
service for company, product and market information. The Library's Biblio¬
graphic Services division processes the material deposited with the Library for
inclusion in its catalogues, and publishes the British National Bibliography
(which lists all new books and new editions published in Britain) and other
bibliographic records. It also provides automated information services for
bibliographic data for libraries and their users. The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for research and development in library
and information services.
A new building at St Pancras, to be occupied from 1991, will eventually house
in one unit most of the Library's London-based operations.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales, the Bodleian Library of
Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library can claim copies of all
new British publications under copyright legislation.
Some of the national museums and government departments have important
libraries. The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of
law and of most government departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh serves the same purpose.
Besides a number of great private collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions.
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the British
Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of Music, the National Library for the
Blind and the National Book League.
The university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of the
colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 9 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some 3-4
million volumes, Edinburgh some 2 million, Leeds some 1-8 million, and
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1 million
volumes. Many universities have important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham and the
British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of
Economics.
Many associations and commercial and industrial organisations operate library
and information services. Although most of these are primarily intended for use
within the organisation, many special libraries can be used, by arrangement, by
people interested in the area covered, and the specialist publications held are
often available for inter-library lending.
Local library authorities have a duty to provide a free lending and reference
library service in their areas. Britain's network of libraries, consisting of 5,500
service points, has a total stock of some 137 million books. About one-third of
the total population are members of public libraries. Some areas are served by
mobile libraries, and domiciliary services cater for people unable to visit a
library. Many libraries have collections of records, audio- and video-cassettes,
and musical scores for loan to the public, while a number also lend from
collections of works of art, which may be originals or reproductions. Most
libraries hold documents on local history, and nearly all provide children's
departments, while reference and information sections and art, music, commer¬
cial and technical departments meet the growing and more specific demands in
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS

these fields. The information role is one of increasing importance for many
libraries, and they are making greater use of information technology including
microcomputers and reference databases.
The Government is advised on library and information matters by four Library
and Information Services Councils or Committees, representing England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively.
In 1985 British publishers issued almost 53,000 separate titles. Of these about
41,000 were new titles and the remainder reprints and new editions. The British
publishing industry devotes much effort to the development of overseas
markets, and exports of British books in 1985 amounted to over £470 million.
The industry is also distinguished for its interest in new technological
developments, including electronic publishing and the development of software
for educational and other purposes.
Among the leading organisations representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association, which has 400 members, and the
Booksellers' Association. The Publishers Association, through its associated
body the Book Development Council, has been active in promoting the export of
British books world-wide.
The British Council publicises British books overseas through its 116
libraries in over 60 countries, participation in international book fairs and a
programme of travelling exhibitions. The Council also publishes a monthly
periodical, British Book News.
The National Book League, whose membership includes authors, publishers,
booksellers, librarians and readers, encourages an interest in books and
arranges exhibitions throughout Britain.
The Press
Newspaper
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per person in Britain
than in most other developed countries. On an average day nearly three out of
four people over the age of 15 read a national morning newspaper and about one
in three reads an evening newspaper. Three out of four adults regularly read a
paid-for regional or local newspaper. National papers have a total circulation of
14-6 million on weekdays and 17-6 million on Sundays though the total
readership is considerably greater.
There are about 130 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers,
1,300 weekly newspapers (including business, sporting and religious news¬
papers) and some 7,000 periodical publications.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. There is no state control or censorship of the press, but it is subject
to the general laws on publication (see p 419). Newspapers are almost always
financially independent of any political party; where they express pronounced
views and have obvious political leanings, these derive from traditional,
proprietorial and other non-party influences. In order to preserve their character
and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are governed by various
trustee-type arrangements. Others have management arrangements to ensure
their editors' authority and independence.
In discussions on a new world information order' and other communications
questions, Britain has opposed measures designed to increase governmental
regulation of the media or to limit the free flow of information. At the same time,
it has reaffirmed its willingness to support efforts to improve communications
systems in the developing world.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and
magazine sales (but not advertising receipts) are zero-rated for value added tax.
Registered newspapers receive a concession on postal rates, and there are
concessions on per-word rates for international press telegrams and photo-
telegrams. Like all postal customers, publishers can obtain reductions in
charges for regular bulk postings.
Newsprint, about two-thirds of which is imported, forms roughly 30 per cent
of average national newspaper costs; labour represents about 40 per cent but
this proportion is likely to fall with the growing use of new technology (see
p 415). Revenue from sales accounts for varying proportions of income; many
newspapers and periodicals derive considerable earnings from their advertising.
Ownership of the national, London-evening and regional daily newspapers is
concentrated in the hands of a number of large press publishing groups (the
groups controlling the national press are listed in Table 43). There are, in
addition, some 200 independent regional and local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with interests ranging over the
whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in indepen¬
dent television and radio companies while others are involved in industrial and
commercial activities.

BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in independent television or independent local radio companies
have led or are leading to results contrary to the public interest, the Independent
Broadcasting Authority can, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the
companies that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There are
similar controls over newspaper interests in cable television services. In
addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting, with
that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies without the
written consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Except in
certain limited cases, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State has
referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received its
report.

Eleven morning daily papers and nine papers published on Sunday (see Table
43) circulate throughout most parts of the country, and are known as national
newspapers. They are mainly produced in London (where Fleet Street has been
the traditional centre for the press), but six of the dailies and five of the Sundays
also print northern editions in Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of
the total production of the national press). An edition of the Financial Times is
printed in the United States using facsimile pages sent by satellite. Today, a new
national newspaper launched in March 1986, is published seven days a week. It
is printed at Poyle (Middlesex), Manchester and Birmingham. A number of
proposals for new national newspapers were under discussion during 1986.
Several newspapers have had very long and distinguished histories: for
example. The Observer, first published in 1791, is the oldest national Sunday
newspaper in the world, and The Times, one of the most influential of all
newspapers and Britain's oldest daily national newspaper, celebrated its
two-hundredth anniversary in 1985.
The leading Scottish papers. The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland.
National newspapers are often thought of as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’ papers
on the basis of differences in style, content and format (broadsheet or tabloid,
though this is not a rigid distinction). Four dailies and three Sundays are
usually described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities and three
of the Sunday populars produce colour supplements as part of the paper.
The slow decline in newspaper circulations as a whole was reversed in 1983
and circulation totalled 33 million in 1985 (compared with 36 million in 1973).
This figure conceals the fact that the circulation of some newspapers has
remained generally steady, while that of others has increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, over 70 morning or
evening dailies and Sundays and some 550 newspapers appearing once or twice
a week) provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give
coverage of national and international affairs. Generally, regional evening
newspapers are non-political, while the morning newspapers adopt a more
positive political stance and tend to be independent or conservative in outlook.
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the Eastern Daily Press
(Norwich) have circulations of 93,000 and 91,000 respectively, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the
Sunday Mercu/y (Birmingham)—sell 125,000 and 168,000 copies, respectively.
Circulation figures of evening papers start at about 11,000 and most are in the
20,000 to 100,000 range; those with much larger sales include the Manchester
Evening News (311,000) and the Birmingham Evening Mail (279,000), Wolver¬
hampton’s Express and Star (240,000), and the Liverpool Echo (211,000).
Weekly papers are of mainly local appeal and are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000 to 30,000 range.
There is currently one London evening newspaper, The London Standard,
with a circulation of some 523,000. A number of evening newspapers are
published in the outer metropolitan area. The hundred or so local weeklies
include papers for every district in Greater London, often in the form of local
editions of an individual paper.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff;
its circulation of 78,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the Daily Post,
published in Liverpool, gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales Argus,
Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening Leader,
Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 28,000 and 101,000. North Wales

is also served by the Liverpool Echo, while the Shropshire Star covers parts of
north and mid-Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller extent by the
Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (some 60 publications) includes English-language papers,
some of which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers and Welsh-language
papers. Welsh community newspapers receive an annual grant as part of the
Government’s wider financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 99,000 and 764,000, are The
Scotsman, published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald; the Daily Record (sister
paper of the Daily Mirror); the Dundee Courier and Advertiser; the Aberdeen
Press and Journal; and the Scottish Daily Express (printed in Manchester). The
evening papers have circulations in the range of 13,000 to 192,000 and are the
Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the
Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post
and the Scottish Sunday Express (printed in Manchester).
Weekly and local newspapers number about 130, and there are some 35 free
weekly newspapers.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening and one Sunday
paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 42,000 to
149,000. They are the News Letter (unionist) and the Irish News (nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News. There are 42 weeklies.
Newspapers from the Irish Republic, as well as the British national press, are
widely read in Northern Ireland.
More than 70 newspapers and magazines are produced by members of the
ethnic minorities, 40 of which are printed in Asian languages and the rest in
English. Most are published weekly or monthly. They include the Asian
newspapers New Life and Asian Times, The Weekly Gleaner—a local edition of
the Jamaican Gleaner, and West Indian Digest. The Voice and Caribbean Times
are aimed at the black population in general as is the magazine Root. An Arabic
daily, Al-Arab, is also produced in Britain.
Some 840 free distribution newspapers (mostly weekly and financed largely by
advertising) are now published in Britain, just over half of them produced by
established newspaper publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth in recent
years and now have an estimated total weekly circulation of some 36 million.
Europe’s first daily free distribution paper, the Daily News, was launched in
Birmingham in 1984.
The 7,000 periodical publications are classified as ‘consumer general’, ‘special¬
ised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or public
services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative’ press
comprises several hundred further titles, most of them devoted to radical
politics, community matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
Consumer general and specialised periodicals include magazines for a wide
range of interests: women’s magazines; publications for children; religious
periodicals; fiction magazines: magazines dealing with sport, motoring, garden¬
ing, pop music, hobbies and humour; computer magazines; and the publica¬
tions of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and other
organisations.
THE PRESS

The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV Times
Magazine, which carry details of the week's television and radio programmes on
BBC and independent television, respectively, each of which has a circulation of
about 3 million, and Woman’s Weekly, Woman’s Own, Woman, Weekly News
(which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly, with circulations in the 640,000
to 1-3 million range. The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a
politically independent publication covering a wider range of topics than its title
implies: the New Statesman, which reviews politics, literature and the arts from
an independent socialist point of view; the Spectator, which covers much the
same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which
represents certain left-wing views within the Labour Party; New Society,
covering the sociological aspects of current affairs: and New Scientist, which
reports on science and technology in terms which the non-specialist can
understand. Articles and features relating largely to BBC television and radio
programmes appear in The Listener. Punch, traditionally the leading humorous
periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also cover public affairs.
Financial Weekly and Investors Chronicle are periodicals for people with
business and investment interests.
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines including Time Out and City Limits provide details
of cultural and other events in London and other large cities.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, generally appeal to the
more serious reader.
Trade, technical, business, scientific and professional journals, publication of
which ranges from twice weekly to quarterly, are an important aspect of British
publishing and business communication, many having a considerable circula¬
tion overseas. There are about 500 publications of significant size covering
business and industrial affairs.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales there
are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both Welsh and
English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals, a weekly
paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals and numerous
popular magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly
publications covering business, professional and leisure interests.
The heavy production costs of newspapers and periodicals continue to
encourage publishers to look for ways of reducing these costs, often by using
computer systems to control editing and production processes. The ‘front end'
or ‘single stroking’ system, for example, allows journalists or advertising staff to
input ‘copy’ directly into a video terminal, and then by pressing a button to
transform it automatically into computer-set columns of type. These columns
can then be assembled electronically on a page-sized screen, turned into a full
page, and made automatically into a plate ready for transfer to the printing
press. Such systems present opportunities for reorganisation which have
implications throughout a newspaper office and often give rise to disputes over
manning levels and other industrial relations problems. Generally, and most
recently in the case of national newspapers, the introduction of computerised
systems has led to substantial reductions in workforces, particularly, but not
solely, among print workers.
About half of the national newspapers now use some computer technology,
while its use in the provincial press, which has generally led the way in adopting
new techniques, is more widespread. The national newspaper. Today, is
produced by a fully computerised system: journalists type articles directly into
and edit them on computer terminals, while colour pictures and graphics are
entered into the same system electronically by scanners. News International,

publisher of two daily and two Sunday papers, uses at its new east London
headquarters more than 500 computer terminals, one of the largest systems
ever installed at one time anywhere in the world. Other national papers are also
building new computer-based printing plants outside Fleet Street.
Other technological developments include the introduction of full-colour
printing, and a switch from traditional letterpress printing to the web-offset
litho process.
The three principal news agencies in Britain are: Reuters, an international news
organisation registered in London, The Press Association Ltd and The Exchange
Telegraph Company Limited.
Reuters is a publicly owned company, employing some 5,400 full-time staff in
81 countries. Of its 890 journalists, nearly 700 work outside the United
Kingdom. The company’s world-wide communications network makes use of
satellites, cables and microwave radio, and is connected to computerised
message-handling systems and data banks located around the world. Services
include general news for the media delivered by teleprinter or fed directly into
clients’ computers, and specialised economic news and information services for
business delivered through video terminals, by teleprinter or by direct computer
feed. Reuters serves subscribers in 158 countries including financial institu¬
tions, commodities houses, traders in currencies, equities and bonds, news¬
papers, radio and television stations and news agencies.
In 1985 Reuters launched its own world service of news pictures, having in the
previous year acquired the news pictures business outside the United States of
United Press International, the American news agency.
The Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency, is co-operatively
owned by the principal daily newspapers of the United Kingdom outside London,
and of the Irish Republic. It provides to national and regional newspapers
and broadcasting services a complete service of home news, including general
and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all types of financial, commercial and
sports news, and includes in its services to regional papers the world news of
Reuters and Associated Press. News is teleprinted from London, certain items
being available in teletypesetting form. Its ‘Newsfile’ service provides general
home news on screen to non-media as well as media clients by means of
telephone and viewdata terminals. Also available on screen is the ‘Esmerk’
service, an international digest of business information. The photographic
department provides newspapers and broadcasters with a daily service of
pictures from Britain and overseas; these are wired to the regional press. The
Special Reporting Service supplies reports of local or special interest. Press
Association Features provides exclusive rights to syndicated articles and visual
features.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Limited supplies financial and sporting
news services and transmits specialist racing services by telephone and video
terminals from offices throughout Britain.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Associ¬
ated Press Ltd and United Press International, which are British subsidiaries of
United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which represents
the principal regional press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.

Institutions
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of further education or direct
recruitment by a regional or local newspaper. Both categories of entrant take
part in an apprenticeship scheme consisting of ‘on-the-job' training, and
block-release courses are provided for those who have not attended a pre-entry
course. There are similar courses for press photographers. Postgraduate courses
in journalism are provided at University College, Cardiff, and at the City
University (London), and courses are provided by the Newspaper Society
Training Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as newspaper sales,
advertising, industrial relations and management.
Specialist training courses for senior journalists from developing countries
are run by the Thomson Foundation in London. The Foundation also conducts
training courses in developing countries and provides consultants to assist
newspapers and magazines in such areas as advertising, management, circula¬
tion and the introduction and operation of new technology. It runs an
international training centre in collaboration with Xinhua News Agency in
Peking.
The Periodical Training Trust is the official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a wide range of short courses covering editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It has special responsibility for
editorial training and administers an industry-wide editorial training scheme
for those already in employment. The postgraduate courses in journalism at
Cardiff and the City University offer periodical journalism options, and the
London College of Printing provides postgraduate courses and General Certifi¬
cate of Education Advanced-level courses in periodical journalism. Business
Press International Limited, one of the largest publishing companies, has an
in-company training course for suitable candidates from the general public.
Under the Hariy Brittain Memorial Fellowship Scheme, administered by
the Commonwealth Press Union, several young Commonwealth journalists
each year spend three months working and studying in Britain, while the
Reuter Foundation, established in 1982, awards six fellowships each year to
journalists from developing countries to study at Oxford, Stanford and
Bordeaux universities.
Annual Student Media Awards are presented jointly by The Guardian
newspaper and the National Union of Students to students in higher education
who have excelled in college press, television and radio journalism.
The most important employers’ organisations are the Newspaper Publishers
Association, whose members publish national newspapers in London and
Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional, local and
London suburban press; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, which represents the owners of weekly
newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers, whose
members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland; and the
Periodical Publishers Association, whose membership embraces the majority of
independent publishers of business, professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are the National Union of Journalists,
with some 32,500 members, and the Institute of Journalists, with about 2,500
members. Two main printing unions are concerned with the press: the Society
of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT) ’82, with 207,000 members, and the
National Graphical Association 1982, with 132,000 members, about one-third
of whom work on newspapers.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors is the officially recognised profes¬
sional body for newspaper editors. It has approximately 450 members and aims

to maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong. The Association of British Editors,
representing the whole range of media including radio, television, newspapers
and magazines, was established in 1984.
The main aim of the Foreign Press Association, founded in 1888, is to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings and a range of other facilities.
The Press Council is a voluntary and non-statutory body founded by the
newspaper industry in 1953 on the recommendation of the first Royal
Commission on the press to safeguard the freedom of the press and to ensure
that it conducts itself responsibly. It comprises equal numbers of press and
non-press members, including members of the public, with an independent
chairman. Its full aims are to preserve the established freedom of the press;
maintain the character of the press in accordance with the highest professional
and commercial standards; keep under review any developments likely to
restrict the supply of information of public interest and importance; deal with
complaints about the conduct of the press or the conduct of individuals and
organisations towards the press; report on developments in the press which may
tend towards greater concentration or monopoly; make representations on
appropriate occasions to the Government, the United Nations and press
organisations abroad; publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording
its work; and review from time to time developments in the press and the factors
affecting them.
Dealing with complaints from the public about the content and conduct of the
press is the Council's best-known function. It has no power to impose penalties
on publications which it has found guilty of malpractice, but relies on the
sanction of adverse publicity. It can censure newspapers, magazines, editors
and journalists, and issues adjudications which the editor of the newspaper or
magazine criticised by the Council has a moral obligation to publish in full. The
Council sometimes initiates inquiries into aspects of press conduct without first
receiving public complaints. Its annual reports include press statistics and
articles on the structure of leading press groups.
Advertising practice in the press (and in the cinema and on posters) is regulated
and controlled by the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
which aims to promote and enforce the highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public and the industry, in particular through the British Code
of Advertising Practice. The objects of the code are to ensure that advertisements
are legal, decent, honest and truthful; that they are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer; that they conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in business; and that no advertisement brings
advertising into disrepute or reduces confidence in advertising as a service to
industry and the public.
The Authority’s main activities are monitoring advertisements for their
compliance with the code; initiating modifications to the code; and dealing with
complaints received direct from members of the public. Its main sanction is the
recommendation to media that advertisements considered to be in breach of the
code should not be published. It also publishes regular reports on the results of
its investigations, naming the companies involved.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
THE PRESS
419
Apart from legal requirements to register newspapers and periodicals and to
reproduce ‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name and place of publication),
there are no specific press laws, but certain statutes include sections which
apply to the press. These relate to such matters as the extent of newspaper
ownership in television and radio companies; the transfer of newspaper assets;
restrictions on the reporting of certain types of court proceedings and on
publishing material likely to stir up racial hatred; the right of press representa¬
tives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities; restrictions on the
publication of advertisement and investment circulars (which are governed by
Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods
and services and with fraud) and of advertisements for remedies for certain
diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements between
British Telecom and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications,
which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain types of
prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are laws such as those on contempt of
court, official secrets, libel and defamation. A newspaper may not publish
comments on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice
the courts’ reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings, nor
may it publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and publication of information of a
confidential or security nature from state and official sources is an offence under
the Official Secrets Act 1911. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for
seditious libel and incitement to disaffection. The majority of legal proceedings
against the press are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases,
the editor, proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as
well as the author, may all be held responsible.
In certain circumstances, where the defence authorities and press representa¬
tives in the Defence, Press and Broadcasting Committee1 agree that publication
of information on particular topics would harm the national interest, defence
notices (‘D’ notices) are circulated to the news media requesting that such
information should not be published. Compliance with these requests is
expected, but they have no legal force; the final responsibility for the decision
whether to publish lies solely with the editor or publisher concerned.

senior civil servant), composed jointly of officials from government departments concerned with
national security and representatives of the press and broadcasting organisations.
23 Television
and Radio
Broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service accountable to
the people through Parliament. Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—provide
television and radio services throughout the country. In Wales the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority is responsible for programmes on one channel. The
authorities work to broad requirements and objectives defined by Parliament,
but are otherwise independent in the day-to-day conduct of business.
This independence carries with it certain obligations over programmes and
programme content. Programmes must display, as far as possible, a proper
balance and wide range of subject matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not offend against good taste. Codes of
guidance on violence in television programmes, particularly during hours when
large numbers of children are likely to be viewing, are operated by both
authorities. A code of advertising standards and practice is also operated by the
IBA. (The BBC does not broadcast advertisements.) A complaints commission
deals with allegations of unfair treatment or infringement of privacy in
programmes. Publicly available video recordings are classified according to their
suitability for different audiences.
The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally, is answerable to
Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a number of
technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain: about
95 per cent of the population watch television, average viewing time per person
being about 25 hours a week. Some 35 per cent of households have two or more
receivers. The growth in use of video-cassette recorders and equipment
(including home computers) for playing television games has for many people
increased the choice of entertainment available in the home. (About 30 per cent
of households rent or own a video-cassette recorder.) Practically every home also
has a radio set, and car radios and portable sets have made radio a major
daytime diversion.
Households with television must buy an annual licence costing £18 for black
and white or £58 for colour. Over 18-6 million licences were current in March
1986, about 15-9 million for colour.
The British The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by Royal Charter and by
Broadcasting a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation of 12 governors including the
Corporation Chairman (each appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Government and
including separate governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) is finally
responsible for all aspects of broadcasting. Committees advise them on a wide
range of matters including the social effects of television, religious broadcasting,
music, agriculture, schools broadcasting, further education, programmes for
ethnic minorities, science and engineering, and charitable appeals. The
governors appoint the Director-General, the Corporation’s chief executive
officer, who heads the BBC’s board of management, which is in charge of the
daily operation of the services.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
control the policy and content of television and radio programmes intended

primarily for reception in their areas. Local radio councils, representative of the
local community, advise on the development and operation of the BBC’s local
radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally from the sale of
television licences. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including television programme exports, sale of recordings and publications
connected with BBC programmes, hire and sale of educational films, film library
sales, and exhibitions based on programmes. Nearly three-quarters of expendi¬
ture on domestic services relates to television. The BBC meets the cost of its local
radio stations wnile some local education authorities help to make educational
programmes.
The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office.
Recommendations on the financing of the BBC’s domestic services were made
by a government-appointed committee under the chairmanship of Professor
Alan Peacock whose report was published in July 1986. The report made
proposals for radical changes in the structure of broadcasting. Its central
recommendation was that British broadcasting should move towards a sophisti¬
cated market system based on freedom of consumer choice with viewers and
listeners having the option of purchasing broadcasting services from as many
alternative sources of supply as possible. Public finance would, however,
continue to be needed for programmes of a public service nature. The report
rejected the idea that the BBC should at present be funded by advertising.
The IBA's constitution and finances are governed by statute. Its 12 members
(three of whom have responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are
appointed by the Home Secretary. The IBA does not produce radio or television
programmes; these are provided by independent programme companies and by
the Channel Four Television Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of the IBA) for
Channel 4 (see p 423). The IBA’s main functions are to appoint the companies,
supervise programme arrangements, control advertising, and build, own and
operate transmitting stations. Its chief executive officer, the Director-General, is
supported by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and
administrative services.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist panel
advises on advertisements of a medical nature. Local committees advise on local
radio services.
The IBA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the television
and radio programme companies. The television programme companies are also
liable to pay to the IBA, for transfer to government funds, a levy related to their
profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide programmes
in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share the contract for
London, one providing programmes during the week and the other at the
weekend). A contract to provide a national early morning television service,
transmitted on the ITV network, is held by an additional company. The
companies operate on a commercial basis, deriving most of their revenue from
the sale of advertising time. The financial resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary considerably, depending largely
on the size of population in the areas in which they operate. Although
newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies, there are
safeguards to protect the public interest.
TELEVISION AND RADIO
423
Television
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These are produced by the company
itself and by other programme companies or bought from elsewhere. The five
largest companies, serving London, north-west England, East Midlands, West
Midlands and Yorkshire, provide more programmes for broadcast elsewhere on
the national network than do the smaller ones. A common news service is
provided by Independent Television News Ltd, a non-profit-making company in
which all the programme companies are shareholders. Negotiations for the
supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and their co-ordinated transmis¬
sion through the independent television network take place largely on the
Network Programme Committee, which consists of representatives of all the
programme companies and of the IBA.
Similar principles apply to independent local radio. The programme com¬
panies are under contract to the IBA, operate under its control and are financed
by advertising revenue. News coverage is supplied as a common service by
Independent Radio News.
Four television channels are in operation. BBC 1 and BBC 2 are owned by the
BBC; ITV (Independent Television) is controlled by, and Channel 4 is owned by,
the IBA; all four channels broadcast on 625 lines ultra-high frequency (uhf).
About 99 per cent of the population live within range of transmission.
Apart from a break during the second world war the BBC has been providing
regular television broadcasts since 1936. About 100 hours of programmes are
transmitted by each of the two BBC channels every week; all BBC 2 programmes
and the vast majority of those on BBC 1 are broadcast on the national network.
Approximately 70 per cent of the BBC’s network programmes for 1985—86 were
produced in London and 30 per cent elsewhere in Britain.
Through co-ordinated planning on its two services the BBC caters simul¬
taneously for people of different interests. While both services cover the whole
range of television output, BBC 1 presents more programmes of general interest,
such as light entertainment, sport, current affairs, children's programmes and
outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places greater emphasis on minority interests,
but also provides documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music,
programmes on pastimes and international films. An early morning television
service on BBC 1 provides about 21/2 hours a day of news, information and light
entertainment. The service runs from Monday to Friday.
The first regular independent television programmes began in London in
1955. On average each of the 14 ITV areas transmitted over 100 hours of
television programmes a week in 1985-86, nearly two-fifths of them comprising
informative programmes—including news, documentaries, and programmes
on current affairs, education and religion. Almost three-quarters of the
programmes are produced by the programme companies. A national early
morning television service on ITV provides about three hours of news,
information, current affairs and light entertainment daily.
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in 1982, provides a national television
service throughout Britain, except in Wales which has a corresponding service
(Sianel 4 Cymru—S4C—see below). The IBA must ensure that programmes on
Channel 4 are complementary to those of ITV, catering for tastes and interests
not normally provided for by the original independent service. It must provide a
suitable proportion (about 15 per cent) of educational programmes, encourage
innovation and experiment, and include a substantial proportion of pro¬
grammes from independent producers. Channel 4 broadcasts for approximately
70 hours a week, about half of which is devoted to informative programmes. The
service, both nationally and in Wales, is financed by subscriptions from the
programme companies in return for advertising time in fourth channel
424
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cable

Radio
programmes broadcast in their own regions. In Wales, programmes on the
fourth channel are run and controlled by the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority
appointed by the Home Secretary. The Authority is required to ensure that a
substantial proportion (in practice some 23 hours a week) are in Welsh and that
those broadcast between 18.30 and 22.00 hours are mainly in Welsh. At other
times the Welsh fourth channel shows national Channel 4 programmes.
Britain is one of the world's foremost exporters of television productions,
exporting in 1984 programmes worth roughly £91 million. In 1985 British
productions won a number of international awards, including first prizes in
four of the five programme categories in the International Emmy Awards in the
United States.
Until recently, about 12 per cent of households with television sets have received
their television services by cable. The vast majority of cable systems have been
used solely to relay broadcast television and radio services in order to improve
reception quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local topography, or
because external aerials are not allowed on some residential buildings.
Legislation has been passed to allow a much more general expansion of cable
television. It is intended that cable investment should be privately financed (the
Government is, however, providing £5 million to the cable television industry to
encourage the development of advanced interactive services such as home
banking and shopping over broadband cable systems); that regulation should be
as light as possible to allow the development of a wide range of services and
facilities, and flexible enough to adapt to changing technology; and that there
should be certain safeguards for existing broadcasting services. A new national
Cable Authority has been established to issue licences, supervise programme
services and promote cable development. In 1983, licences were awarded to 11
cable systems to serve as pilot projects, and some existing cable operators,
formerly relaying broadcast services, have been licensed to offer additional
services on their existing systems. By August 1986 the Cable Authority had
awarded a further nine cable franchises.
In January 1986 the number of homes capable of receiving non-broadcast
cable services was 975,000. The number of homes receiving such services was
127,000. Cable operators are represented by the Cable Television Association.
BBC Radio has four national channels. Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop music,
while Radio 2 provides music and light entertainment as well as being the
principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 broadcasts mainly classical
music as well as drama, poetry and short stories, talks and documentaries, and
Test Match cricket (on medium wave only). Radio 4 is the main speech network,
providing the principal news and current affairs service, as well as drama,
comedy, documentaries and panel games; it also carries parliamentary coverage
and live relays of major public events. At present, there is no independent
national radio service, but legislation passed in 1984 gave the IBA power to build
a transmitter network for such a service.
There are 32 BBC local radio stations serving England and the Channel
Islands, and regional and community radio services in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, as well as 44 ILR (independent local radio) contractors
throughout Britain. Further BBC and ILR stations are planned. About 90 per
cent of the population is served by BBC or ILR stations. Broadcasts provide a
comprehensive service of local news and information, music and other
entertainment, education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and
offer listeners a chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
There are also some 200 hospital and 20 university closed-circuit radio
stations.

Both the BBC and the IBA broadcast educational programmes for children and
students in schools of all kinds, as well as for pre-school children, and for adults
in colleges and other institutions and in their homes. Broadcasts to schools
cover most subjects of the curriculum, while education programmes for adults
cover many fields of learning, vocational training and recreation. Supporting
material in the form of books, pamphlets, filmstrips, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes, is available to supplement the programmes. The BBC
broadcasts television and radio programmes made specially for students of the
Open University, most of whose 130 or so undergraduate courses contain video
and audio components, some of them available on cassette for use with
correspondence texts. The BBC Open University Centre also produces educa¬
tional and training audio-visual materials in collaboration with external
agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of
Education and Science and the Engineering Industry Training Board.
The BBC External Services broadcast by radio world-wide, using English and 36
other languages, for over 730 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, reflect British opinion and project British life, culture and
developments in science and industry. News bulletins, current affairs pro¬
grammes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes form the
main part of the output, with a full sports service, music, drama and general
entertainment.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of time
each is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from this the BBC
has full responsibility and is completely independent in determining the content
of news and other programmes. A plan to improve audibility is in progress.
The BBC World Service broadcasts by radio for 24 hours a day in English and
is supplemented at peak listening times by programmes of special interest to
Africa, South Asia and the Falkland Islands. Plans to broadcast a televised
service are being considered by the BBC.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are re-broadcast by the radio
services of many countries. Re-broadcasting involves direct relays from BBC
transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the BBC
Transcription Service. There are some 3,000 re-broadcasts weekly of World
Service programmes in about 150 countries. The Transcription Service offers
programmes to over 100 countries.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast
weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and recorded lessons
are supplied to 300 stations in over 100 countries free of charge. English by
Television programmes are also shown in more than 100 countries. There is a
wide range of printed and audio material accompanying these programmes.
Another part of the External Services, the Monitoring Service, listens to and
reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news and
comment from overseas to the BBC, the press and the Government.
Radio for overseas is also produced by the radio services of the Central Office of
Information (COI). A wide range of recorded material is sent to radio stations in
about 100 countries. COI television services provide material such as
documentary and magazine programmes for distribution to overseas stations.
The BBC does not give publicity to any firm or organised interest except when it
is necessary to provide effective and informative programmes. It must not
broadcast any commercial advertisement or any sponsored programme.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but advertisers can
have no influence on programme content or editorial control. Advertisements

must be clearly distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the time
given to them must not be so great as to detract from the value of the
programmes as a medium of information, education or entertainment. Advertis¬
ing is normally limited to seven minutes in any one hour of broadcasting time,
and averaged over the day’s programmes must not exceed six minutes per hour.
The independent local radio stations are normally limited to a maximum of nine
minutes of advertising each hour. The IBA has a code governing standards and
practice in advertising on television and radio and giving guidance on the types
and methods of advertisement which are prohibited; this includes advertising
with a political or religious object or on behalf of cigarettes or betting.
Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programme, such as
broadcasts to schools. A comparable code has been adopted by the Cable
Authority, which is responsible for advertising control and policy on cable
television. The IBA has endorsed the Principles for Advertising by Direct Satellite
Broadcasting which have been drawn up by the European Broadcasting Union.
The Government has no general privileged access to radio or television but
government publicity material to support non-political campaigns may be
broadcast on independent radio and television. This is prepared through the
COI and broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis. Short public
service items, concerning health, safety and welfare, are also produced by the
COI for free transmission by the BBC and independent television and radio.
Parliamentary reporting includes a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament. Proceedings, including those of committees, are
broadcast on radio, some live and others in recorded form in radio and television
news and current affairs programmes. The House of Commons is not televised.
The issue has arisen on a number of occasions, with members voting against it,
most recently in 1985. However, an experiment in televising the House of Lords
began in 1985 and members decided in 1986 that it should continue on a
permanent basis.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are transmitted periodically on radio
and television, under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC
and the IBA, and there are special arrangements for the period following the
announcement of a general election.
Both the BBC and the IBA are required to keep themselves informed on the state
of public opinion about the programmes (and, in the case of the IBA, the
advertising) they broadcast. This is done through the continuous measurement
of the size and composition of audiences and their opinions of programmes. For
television, this work is undertaken through the Broadcasters' Audience
Research Board, which is owned jointly by the BBC and the IBA. Information is
collected from a panel of about 3,000 homes throughout the country designed to
be representative of all private households in Britain with a television set. Meters
attached to each television set and linked to a central computer are used to
record times of viewing, numbers of viewers and programmes watched. Regular
surveys and questionnaires are conducted by both the BBC and the IBA to gauge
audience opinion on television and radio services, and public opinion is further
assessed by both bodies through the work of their many advisory committees,
councils and panels (whose members are drawn from a wide cross-section of the
public); the regular holding of public meetings to debate the services provided;
and careful consideration of correspondence and telephone calls from listeners
and viewers.
One of the most important recent developments has been the introduction of
smaller, lighter cameras and video recorders for use on location. Electronic
TELEVISION AND RADIO
427
International
Relations
news-gathering equipment, whereby pictures can be transmitted directly to a
studio or recorded on video tape on location, reduces significantly the time
before an item can be broadcast. Other developments include the use of new
types of video tape recorders, the increasing use of computers to generate
graphical shapes such as captions and credits, and the improvement of the
quality of video tape pictures.
Among recent developments by the BBC are the ACE digital television
standards converter, probably the most advanced in the world, which is used to
convert pictures between the European and American standards, and the
NICAM system used to carry high-quality sound programme signals across the
country. Both of these systems have been licensed to commercial manufactur¬
ers. The BBC has also developed a data-labelling system for sound programmes
which will make programme and station selection much easier. Research
includes investigations into stereo sound for television, digital transmission of
signals over fibre-optic cables, improved picture displays, and many aspects of
satellite broadcasting. IBA engineers were the first in the world to introduce a
fully digital field rate standards converter to improve the interchange of
programmes between areas using the 525-line system and those using the
625-line system. The IBA is at present engaged in the further development of
digital techniques for studio applications and inter-city links, and a study of the
future use of satellites for broadcasting which has included the development of a
new C-MAC transmission system for use on future direct broadcast satellites.
C-MAC has been accepted by the Government as the United Kingdom satellite
transmission standard, and has been recommended by the European Broad¬
casting Union as the standard for Europe.
Another IBA development has been an enhanced C-MAC system for satellite
transmission capable of providing wide-screen pictures at a subjective definition
of about 1,000 lines, fully compatible with C-MAC transmissions and capable of
being transmitted in a single 27-MHz satellite channel.
It is hoped that by 1990 direct broadcasting by satellite, by which television
pictures are transmitted directly from space into people’s homes, will be
available throughout Britain. The IBA is seeking programme contractors for
three of the five satellite channels allocated to the United Kingdom by
international agreement. The service will be a commercial one funded by
advertising or subscriptions.
The BBC and IBA have co-operated in the development of a teletext system,
known by the BBC as CEEFAX and the IBA as ORACLE. The use of teletext
allows the television signal to carry additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages' of text and graphics on receivers equipped with the
necessary decoders. The system is also used to provide programme subtitles,
which are of great benefit to the deaf and hard of hearing. Over 2 million
teletext-equipped sets are in use in Britain. More than 95 per cent of teletext sets
throughout the world are based on the British system, and working services
operating to the British standard are in use or on trial in 13 countries, including
Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. British
Telecom s public viewdata service, ‘PresteL, offers a wide range of information
which is transmitted via the telephone and viewed on the screen of a television
receiver.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. This body
manages Eurovision, the international network of television news and pro¬
gramme exchange, and is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes and news over the
Eurovision network and intercontinental satellite links; it also maintains a
428
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
technical monitoring station where frequency measurements and other observa¬
tions on broadcasting stations are carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and national broadcasters of Western Europe
and other parts of the world and co-ordinates co-operation in radio and
television.
The BBC is a shareholder in Visnews, which supplies world newsfilm to 425
television stations in 100 countries and is the most widely used newsfilm agency
in the world. Worldwide Television News is owned by Independent Television
News, the American Broadcasting Company and Channel 9 in Australia, and
supplies services to over 500 broadcasters in 75 countries via the Eurovision
network, and by satellite.
The BBC and the IBA are associate members of the Asian Pacific Broadcasting
Union, and the BBC also belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Associa¬
tion (CBA), whose members extend to one another such facilities as the use of
studios, recording channels and programme contributions. The BBC provides
technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisa¬
tions throughout the world; members of its staff are seconded for service
overseas.
The Government finances a number of overseas students on broadcasting
training courses at the BBC, the British Council (which aims to promote a wider
knowledge of Britain and the English language abroad and to develop closer
cultural relations between Britain and other countries) and the Thomson
Foundation Television College in Glasgow, which sends lecturers and arranges
courses overseas.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Telecom¬
munications Union, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating and
controlling all international telecommunications services (including radio and
television), allocating and registering all radio frequencies and promoting and
co-ordinating the international study of technical problems in broadcasting.
The BBC and the IBA are also represented on the United Kingdom Committee of
the International Special Committee on Radio Interference. The BBC maintains
a number of offices overseas.
24 Sport and
Recreation
The British invented and codified the rules of many of the sports and games
which are now played all over the world, and there is widespread interest in most
kinds of sport throughout the country. Large crowds attend occasions such as
the association football and rugby league challenge Cup Finals at Wembley
Stadium, the international rugby union matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield
and Cardiff Arms Park, the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic
horse races, Grand Prix motor racing and the cricket Test matches. Extensive
coverage of sport on television has helped to generate interest in a wide variety of
sports including basketball, darts, snooker, ice skating, skiing and athletics.
Levels of participation in sport have been rising due mainly to the increases in
leisure time and facilities, greater mobility and rising living standards. A
growing awareness of the importance to good health of regular exercise has been
reflected in the upsurge of interest in jogging and marathon running. It has
been estimated that about one-third of the adult population regularly takes part
in outdoor sport, and about a quarter in indoor sport. Men greatly outnumber
women in active sport.
The Government has long recognised the importance of physical recreation for
the general welfare of the community; the social role that sport can play has
become more important at a time of high unemployment and rapid change in
work and leisure patterns. The ten-year strategy for the development of sport in
England drawn up by the Sports Council in 1982 is to encourage further
increases in participation, particularly among young people and those nearing
retirement; to provide adequate facilities for the whole community, especially in
the inner cities and in deprived rural areas; and to continue to encourage high
standards of performance. Similar strategies are being followed by the Sports
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In January 1985 the four
Sports Councils mounted a two-year campaign, ‘Ever thought of Sport?’, jointly
financed by the Government and private commercial interests, which is aimed
at boosting participation in sports among the 13 to 24 age group. The ‘Action
Sport’ programme, which has been supported by the Manpower Services
Commission, is designed to encourage young people in inner cities to take up
sport and recreation; the programme is to be expanded in 1986-87. ‘What’s
Your Sport?', a new campaign to increase participation in sports, will be
launched by the Sports Councils in 1987.
Gleneagles In accordance with the statement on apartheid in sport, agreed by the
Agreement Commonwealth heads of Government at Gleneagles in Scotland in 1977, the
Government seeks to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa and
withholds any form of support for such contacts; in a democratic society,
however, it cannot prevent these contacts if an individual sportsman or the
governing body of the sport concerned chooses to ignore its advice.
ORGANISATION Government policy on sport, active recreation and children’s play is co-ordinated
AND in England by the Minister for Sport (a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
PROMOTION at the Department of the Environment). The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities in their countries.

Sports Councils
Countryside
Commissions
Private
Sponsorship
Responsibility for the organisation and promotion of sport is largely decentral¬
ised, and most sports and recreation facilities are provided by local authorities.
The Government provides financial and other assistance through a number of
official bodies and schemes. This ‘arm’s length' principle of funding safeguards
the long-established independence of sports organisations in Britain. Some of
these bodies, such as the Sports Councils and the Countryside Commissions,
have specific responsibilities for sport and recreation, and help other public and
private bodies to provide facilities. Others, like the Forestry Commission, the
British Waterways Board, the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional
water authorities, provide recreational amenities in addition to their main
functions.
Individual sports are run by over 260 independent governing bodies whose
functions usually include drawing up rules, holding events, regulating mem¬
bership, selecting and training national teams and promoting international
links. There are also organisations representing people who take part in more
informal physical recreation, such as walking and cycling.
A National Coaching Foundation has been established to improve the
knowledge and practice of coaching in Britain. The work of the foundation
complements that of the four Sports Councils and the governing bodies of
sports.
Government assistance for the development of sport in Great Britain is
channelled through three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England
and for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for
Wales and the Scottish Sports Council. In Northern Ireland the Department of
Education makes direct grants towards the capital cost of facilities to local
authorities and voluntary sports bodies; the Sports Council for Northern Ireland
has limited grant-making powers. The Councils will allocate government funds
amounting to some £45 million in 1986-87. They make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sports
and other national organisations, and administer the national sports centres.
Grants and loans are also made to voluntary organisations and local authorities
(and, in some cases, to commercial organisations) to assist the provision of
sports facilities. In all, the Councils supported over 1,000 projects in 1985-86.
The Sports Council assists British representatives at international sports
meetings and encourages links with international and overseas organisations.
All four Councils have information centres providing data on a wide range of
sports topics. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of Physical
Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and representative
bodies of sport and physical recreation in England; the equivalent bodies in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the Scottish and Welsh Sports
Associations and the Northern Ireland Council of Physical Recreation.
Ten regional councils for sport and recreation in England, on each of which
sporting, countryside and local authority interests are represented, advise on
investment in and the planning of sporting and recreational facilities.
The Countryside Commissions are responsible for encouraging the development
of facilities for open-air recreation in the countryside. These include the
provision, by public and private bodies and by voluntary groups, of country
parks and picnic sites as well as recreational paths.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations, and its importance as a source of funding is recognised by the
Government and the Sports Council. The estimated value of commercial
SPORT AND RECREATION
431
PROVISION OF
FACILITIES
sponsorship was some £120 million in 1985. Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to individual sports organisations or
sportsmen and sportswomen. The Sports Aid Foundation and Sports Aid Trust
raise and distribute funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in
order to assist the training of talented individual sportsmen; grants are awarded
on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The Scottish and
Welsh Sports Aid Foundations and the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust fulfil
similar functions. Sponsorship advisory services are also run by the Sports
Councils and the Central Council of Physical Recreation.
To encourage private sector investment in sporting projects and facilities, the
Sports Council runs a scheme which matches contributions from the private
and voluntary sectors to provide facilities in designated areas. Following the
success of the scheme in Merseyside and Bristol, it has been extended to
London, the West Midlands, and Tyne and Wear.
Successive governments have negotiated voluntary agreements with the
tobacco industry to regulate tobacco companies' sponsorship of sport, the last
one having been negotiated in 1986.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation; their total planned expenditure on sport and recreation
amounts to some £900 million in Britain in 1986—87. Provision of facilities was
substantially increased in the 1970s to meet the increasing demand and to
encourage further expansion of participation. The facilities provided include
parks, lakes, playing fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, swimming
pools (of which there are nearly 1,200 throughout Britain) and sports centres
catering for a wide range of activities.
Increased emphasis is being placed on the need to provide new and improved
sports facilities in areas of urban stress. A wide range of sports and recreational
projects in urban areas are supported under the Government’s urban pro¬
gramme, while the Derelict Land Grant scheme provides funding towards sports
and recreational facilities on reclaimed sites. In 1984—85 total urban pro¬
gramme and Derelict Land Grant scheme support for sports and recreational
projects amounted to £35 million.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities, many
facilities are made available by local sports clubs. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those providing sports grounds, particularly
for games such as cricket, association and rugby football, hockey, tennis and
golf. Clubs linked to business firms often cater for a wide range of activities.
Commercial facilities include tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving ranges, curling rinks and riding
stables.
Publicly maintained schools must provide for the physical education of their
pupils. All (except those solely for infants) are expected to have a playing field or
the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium. Some have other
amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance
and movement. Sports and recreation facilities are also provided at institutions
of higher and further education (some of which have departments of physical
education), and there are ‘centres of sporting excellence’, often at universities
and other colleges, which enable selected young athletes to develop their talents
and which provide, where appropriate, for their educational needs.
In order to achieve the maximum use of existing sports facilities, the
Government is encouraging greater community use of sports centres and other
facilities owned by schools, colleges and other public and private sector
institutions, including football clubs. In 1985, together with the Sports Council,
the Government launched an initiative under the title ‘Opening Doors' to
432

encourage the shared use of school and other sports facilities at times when they
would otherwise lie empty.
Safety at sports grounds and stadia is governed by legislation, but, following
the fire at Bradford City Football Ground in 1985, in which 56 people died, and
the subsequent findings of a committee of inquiry, safety standards are being
strengthened.
Six national sports centres, five in England and one in Wales, are run by the
Sports Council, and provide a range of competition and training facilities. As
well as offering residential courses for national teams, coaches and enthusiasts
from all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local sports clubs and
the local community. Combined facilities for a range of sports are provided at
three of the centres: Crystal Palace in south-east London, Bisham Abbey in
Buckinghamshire and Lilleshall in Shropshire. Crystal Palace provides major
competition venues for athletics and swimming and a variety of indoor sports,
and Lilleshall houses the training school of the Football Association. The other
three are specialist centres: the National Sailing Centre, Cowes, Isle of Wight;
the National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, which
caters for rowing, canoeing and water-skiing; and the Plas-y-Brenin National
Centre for Mountain Activities in north Wales. The Sports Council for Wales
runs the National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff and the National Outdoor
Pursuits Centre at Plas Menai in north Wales.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor pursuits, Inverclyde at Largs for
general sports, and a national water sports training centre on Great Cumbrae
Isle in the Firth of Clyde. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland operates one
national facility, the Northern Ireland Mountain Centre at Tollymore in County
Down.
Some 600 purpose-built indoor sports centres and 1,000 sports halls serve
local rather than national needs; in Northern Ireland there has been a major
development of multi-purpose centres. Several privately run centres cater for
specialised interests, such as the National Equestrian Centre, run by the British
Equestrian Federation, and the Ludwig Guttmann Sports Centre for the
Disabled, Stoke Mandeville.
The Minister for Sport has responsibility for co-ordinating policy on children's
play. The Department of Education and Science is concerned with play in
schools, and the Department of Health and Social Security with play for the
under-fives. Play Board—the Association for Children's Play and Recreation
Ltd—is an independent national organisation, funded by the Department of the
Environment, which promotes facilities and opportunities for children’s play in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The National Playing Fields Association is a charity which has for many years
encouraged the provision of playing fields and recreational facilities, specialis¬
ing in the needs of children and young people, including the young disabled.
There are affiliated associations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and in the
counties of England and Wales.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association’s committee consists of
representatives of the 29 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British teams, raises funds,
makes all the arrangements and provides a headquarters staff for the
management of the teams.

The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, is the
co-ordinating body of sport and recreation for all disabilities. The Association,
which receives an annual Sports Council grant, encourages disabled people to
take part in physical recreation and sport for pleasure and as an aid to
rehabilitation and integration with the able-bodied community. It also seeks to
secure the provision and improvement of facilities in consultation with national
and local authorities.
Sports clubs for the disabled throughout Britain are affiliated to the
Association, which helps to organise sporting and physical activities at all levels,
including national and international meetings. As well as offering advice to local
clubs and groups, the Association arranges conferences, seminars and coaching
courses, and acts as co-ordinating body for the various disability groups. It
serves as the focal point for national team management and selection at world
and Paralympic levels, and organises world events on behalf of international
bodies. In Scotland the Scottish Sports Association for the Disabled has a
co-ordinating role.
The first sports stadium in the world designed for the disabled was opened at
Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, in 1969, and is owned and maintained by
the British Paraplegic Sports Society. Annual national games organised by
several of the associations for the disabled take place at Stoke Mandeville,
Crystal Palace in London and at other locations; the Seventh World Wheelchair
Games (or Paralympics) were held at Stoke Mandeville in 1984.
The growing problem of drug-taking in sport in order to achieve unfair
improvements in performance has been a cause of concern both to the Sports
Councils and to the governing bodies of sport. A campaign to tackle the problem,
launched by the Sports Council, includes the introduction in 25 sports of
random drug-testing procedures which can lead to a life ban for offending
competitors. In Scotland the governing bodies of over 90 per cent of competitive
sports have voluntarily introduced testing. The Sports Council continues to
fund research into methods of detection for new drugs that unfairly aid
performance.
The Government and the Sports Council have also taken firm action at
international level by supporting the adoption of a European Anti-Doping
Charter and by chairing an international working party to examine ways of
promoting effective anti-doping measures.
Some of the major sports and recreations in Britain are described below. The
increased provision of sports centres has improved opportunities for participa¬
tion in indoor sports such as basketball, volleyball, fencing, judo and other
martial arts, gymnastics, squash, table tennis and shooting. Almost all outdoor
sports have continued to gain in popularity, including the ‘high-risk’ activities
such as rock-climbing and sub-aqua diving. The number of people enjoying the
recreational amenities of the countryside, rivers and coastline is similarly
growing. Two sports introduced from overseas in the 1970s which have gained
rapidly in popularity are windsurfing and hang-gliding; the flying of microlight
aircraft is one of the newest sports to achieve a keen following.
Sportsmen may be professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports,
such as rugby union, hockey and rowing, are amateur but in others the
distinction between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined, or
does not exist. The British Amateur Athletic Board, for example, allows
payments to be made into trust funds held by many top-ranking athletes.
The largest spectator sport and one of the most popular participation sports,
association football was first developed and codified in England during the
434
BRITAIN 1987: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Athletics
nineteenth century, and is controlled by separate football associations in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England over 350 clubs are
affiliated to the English Football Association (FA) and some 40,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. The full-time professional clubs in England and
Wales belong to the Football League (92 clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish
Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in England and Wales
and three in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, 14 semi-professional clubs play in
the Irish Football League. During the season, which lasts from August until
May, attendances at over 2,000 English league matches total about 18 million.
The Football Association, founded in 1863, and the Football League, founded in
1888, were both the first of their kind in the world.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Littlewoods Challenge
Cup (formerly the League Cup), the Scottish FA Cup, the Skol Cup (formerly the
Scottish League Cup), the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals are played at Wembley Stadium, London, at
Hampden Park, Glasgow, at Windsor Park, Belfast, and bn a two-match home
and away basis in Wales. British clubs were European club champions
(Liverpool three times, Nottingham Forest twice and Aston Villa once) for six
consecutive years between 1977 and 1982, and Liverpool became champions
again in 1984. Aberdeen won the European Cup-Winners Cup in 1983, as did
Everton in 1985; Ipswich Town and Tottenham Hotspur won the Union of
European Football Associations (UEFA) cup competition in 1981 and 1984
respectively.
The Sports Councils, using specially allocated funds, have made grants to a
number of clubs and local authorities to enable them to modernise or expand
football facilities in areas of urban deprivation. Grants for various improve¬
ments such as all-weather pitches are also made throughout Britain by the
football associations and the Football Trust, a body financed by the football pools
(see p 443) companies; its sister body, the Football Grounds Improvement
Trust, is specifically concerned with ground safety.
Spectator violence associated with football both in Britain and overseas has
been a subject of growing concern, and the Government has worked closely with
the football authorities and the governments of other European countries to
combat the problem. After serious disturbances involving English supporters at
the European Cup Final in Brussels in May 1985 which led to the deaths of 38
spectators, English clubs were withdrawn from European competitions for the
1985—86 season by the Football Association; an indefinite ban on the clubs was
subsequently imposed by UEFA and, on a world-wide basis, by FIFA (the
International Federation of Football Associations), though the latter was later
rescinded. Britain has signed a Council of Europe Convention, adopted in 1985,
which is designed to eliminate spectator violence at all sporting events,
including football. The Government has restricted the sale of alcohol in football
grounds and banned its sale on transport to matches, and it is an offence to take
cans or bottles into grounds.
Under public order legislation at present before Parliament the courts would
be given power to ban convicted hooligans from football matches, and a new
offence of disorderly conduct would be created covering behaviour which, while
not in itself violent, causes unnecessary distress to others. Possession of smoke
bombs and fireworks at or on entry to a football ground would also become an
offence. Greater use is being made of closed-circuit television at football
grounds, and the introduction of club membership schemes for supporters is
under discussion.
Amateur athletics is governed in England by the Amateur Athletic Association
(which, formed in 1880, was the first national governing body for athletics) and
SPORT AND RECREATION
435
Highland

by the Women's Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland have their own associations. International athletics and the selection of
British teams are the concern of the British Amateur Athletic Board, which also
administers coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games and the world and
European championships one team represents the United Kingdom.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers of participants, both men and
women, in part because of the success of British competitors and the wide
coverage of athletics events on television.
Many British athletes, especially middle-distance runners, have enjoyed
distinguished reputations: in 1954, for example. Dr Roger Bannister became
the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. More recently, Britons won 15
medals at the 1986 European Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, including
gold medals in the 100 metres (Linford Christie), 400 metres (Roger Black), 800
metres (Sebastian Coe), 1,500 metres (Steve Cram), 5,000 metres (Jack
Buckner), 4 x 400 metres relay (Derek Redmond, Kriss Akabusi, Brian Whittle
and Roger Black), decathlon (Daley Thompson) and the women’s javelin (Fatima
Whitbread). At the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles British athletes
won 16 medals including three gold medals. Eight world records were held by
Britons in August 1986: the 800 metres and the 1,000 metres by Sebastian Coe;
the mile and the 2,000 metres by Steve Cram; the 4 x 800 metres relay by Peter
Elliott, Gary Cook, Steve Cram and Sebastian Coe; and the decathlon by Daley
Thompson; the women’s 5,000 metres by Zola Budd; and the women’sjavelin by
Fatima Whitbread.
The thirteenth Commonwealth Games were held in Scotland in July and
August 1986 at venues in Edinburgh and elsewhere.
Scottish Highland Games, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting
the weight and throwing the hammer), dancing and piping competitions take
place, attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world. Among
better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar Gathering, which is
traditionally attended by the royal family, the Argyllshire and Cowal Gatherings
and the meeting at Aboyne.
The origins of badminton are not clear, but the Badminton Association of
England, which together with the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Badminton Unions
today organises the sport in Britain, was formed in 1893 and the first
tournament was promoted five years later. Badminton expanded rapidly in the
1970s and is played in a variety of locations from sports centres to village halls;
some 2 million people are estimated to play the game in Britain, about 1 million
of them regularly. Over 5,000 clubs and as many schools are affiliated to the
Badminton Association of England, which organises the All England Cham¬
pionships each year. British women players have done particularly well in the
sport: Nora Perry and Jane Webster of England were world champions in 1982.
The England women’s team won a silver medal, and the men’s a bronze, at the
1984 world team championships. The English team (men and women) are
reigning Commonwealth Games champions.
Basketball is played in Britain both indoors and outdoors. There are about 900
registered clubs and the sport is played in most secondary schools and many
other institutions; in all, over 1 million people participate and its popularity has
been increasing rapidly. The English Basket Ball Association is the governing
body of the sport in England, and there are similar associations in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The leading English clubs play in a national
league and the main events of the year are the National Championship Finals,
held at Wembley Arena in London, and the men’s National Cup Final, staged at
the Royal Albert Hall.

Billiards and
Snooker
Bowls
Boxing
Chess
The character of the present game of billiards was established in Britain at the
end of the seventeenth century. Snooker, a more varied game invented by the
British in India in 1875, has greatly increased in popularity and become a major
spectator sport as a result of widespread television coverage of the professional
tournaments. It is estimated that between 5 and 6 million people now play the
game. British players have an outstanding record in snooker and the major
professional championships have been largely dominated by them. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World Professional Championship, held in
Sheffield; British winners of this event include Ray Reardon (six times), John
Spencer (three times), and more recently Joe Johnson (1986), Dennis Taylor
(1985), Alex Higgins (1972 and 1982) and Steve Davis (1981, 1983 and 1984).
Northern Ireland won the world team championship in 1984 and 1985, as did
England in 1981 and 1983.
The controlling body for the world professional game is the Billiards and
Snooker Control Council, which holds the copyright of the rules. The World
Professional Billiards and Snooker Association is responsible for professional
players, and it organises professional events.
Bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. The game of lawn
bowls is played on a flat green; in the midlands and north of England and in
North Wales a variation called crown green bowls is played, so named because
the centre of the green is higher than its boundaries. Lawn and crown green
bowls are mainly summer games; in winter indoor bowls, played on synthetic
greens, is growing in popularity. At one time regarded as a pastime for the
elderly, bowls is increasingly played by adults of all ages. Over 2,600 lawn
bowling clubs are affiliated to the English Bowling Association, which, together
with the Bowling Associations of Scotland, Wales and Ireland and the English
Women's Bowling Association, play to the rules of the International Bowling
Board. Other associations, including the English Bowling Federation, are not
under the Board's control. The British Crown Green Bowling Association is the
governing body of crown green bowls, and has nearly 2,000 affiliated clubs.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize-fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional, and in both strict
medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England, including schoolboy, club and association
boxing, and boxing in the armed services, is controlled by the Amateur Boxing
Association. There are separate associations in Scotland and Wales; Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Boxing Association. The associations organise
various amateur boxing competitions, and teams from England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in international competitions such as
the Commonwealth Games and the European and world championships; a
British team competes in the Olympic Games.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints inspectors, medical officers and representatives to ensure that
regulations are observed and to guard against overmatching and exploitation.
British boxing has a distinguished record and at various times British boxers
have held European, Commonwealth and world championship titles; Dennis
Andries holds the World Boxing Council light-heavyweight world title.
Chess has increased greatly in popularity and England now ranks among the top
chess-playing nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are separately

represented). There are local chess clubs and leagues throughout the country
and the game is widely played in schools and colleges. Important domestic
competitions include the Kleinwort Grieveson British Championships, the
Peterborough Software National Club Championships, the Leigh Grand Prix,
the Pergamon British Lightning Championship and The Times British Schools
Chess Tournament. The best-known international event is the Foreign and
Colonial Hastings Chess Congress. The governing bodies of the game are the
British Chess Federation, the Scottish Chess Association (the oldest such body
in the world, which celebrated its centenary in 1984) and the Welsh and Ulster
Chess Unions.
At present England has 10 Grandmasters for over-the-board chess.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game, having been played as early as the 1550s. Among the
many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC), which reframed the laws of the game. The Club is based at Lord's cricket
ground in north London, the administrative centre of the world game. Men's
cricket in Britain is now governed by the Cricket Council, consisting of
representatives of the Test and County Cricket Board (representing first-class
cricket), the National Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket)
and the MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns and
villages amateur teams play weekly games from late April to the end of
September. In England there is a network of league cricket contested by teams of
Saturday afternoon players; in the midlands and the north of England these
teams include a full-time professional. The game is also played to a lesser extent
in Scotland and Wales.
The main competition in professional cricket is the Britannic Assurance
County Championship of three-day games played by 17 county teams, which
also take part in three one-day competitions—the Benson and Hedges Cup, the
National Westminster Bank Trophy, and the John Player Special League played
on Sundays. Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day
Test matches played between England and a touring team from Australia, India,
New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka or the West Indies. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these countries in the British winter.
Texaco Trophy one-day international games also attract large crowds. A World
Cup is played every four years, with some of the smaller cricketing nations as
well as the major countries competing; India and Pakistan will jointly hold the
next one in 1987.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926. Women’s cricket clubs have
regular weekend local fixtures and participate in an annual national club
knockout competition. The game is also played at county level and Test match
series are played by England against Australia, India, New Zealand and the West
Indies. A women’s World Cup, in which England competes, is held every four
years.
Darts, an indoor game which has its origins in medieval archery, is played
mainly in public houses as a casual recreation to accompany drinking. It has
gained in popularity as a result of widespread television coverage of the
professional game. As many as 9 million people at a time watch televised darts
contests and it is estimated that over 5 million people play the game regularly.
Darts is organised in Britain by the British Darts Organisation, which forms
part of the World Darts Federation; its rules have become the code for the world
sport. The Organisation arranges events in Britain which bring entrants from

as many as 45 countries. Every two years a World Cup tournament is held,
which England won in 1985 in Brisbane. The main individual title in the game
is the Embassy World Professional Championship. British players have domi¬
nated the event and in 1986 the title was won by Eric Bristow of England.
British field sports include hunting (on horseback and on foot), fishing,
shooting, stalking, falconry and hare coursing. The hunting seasons vary
depending on the quarry. The fox hunting and hare hunting season lasts from
November to April, while mink hunting takes place in the summer months. Fox
hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most popular British
hunting sport, and there are over 400 packs of hounds of all kinds in Britain.
Game shooting as an organised sport probably originated in the early part of
the nineteenth century, and takes place in many parts of Britain. Game consists
of grouse, black-grouse, partridge, pheasant and ptarmigan, species which are
protected by law during a close season when they are allowed to breed on
numerous estates supervised by gamekeepers. It is necessary to have a licence to
kill game and a certificate issued by the police to own a shot-gun. The Game
Conservancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game
conservation, collects information and studies factors controlling game popula¬
tions.
The most popular country sport is fishing, and there are about 4 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout, particularly in the rivers and
lochs of Scotland and in Wales, but in England and Wales the most widely
practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, tench and
bream. Angling clubs in England affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
(there are similar bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and many
clubs organise angling competitions. The National Federation of Anglers
organises national championships and enters a team in the world angling
championships. In 1985 England won both the world team and individual
events. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for: most coarse fishing is let to
angling clubs by private owners, while trout and salmon fishermen may rent a
stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing are free to all (apart from salmon and sea trout
fishing which is by licence only).
The British Field Sports Society and the British Association for Shooting and
Conservation look after the interests of all field sports. Public opposition to field
sports is not inconsiderable and is organised through such bodies as the League
Against Cruel Sports.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game. The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh, the oldest
club in the world, celebrated its 250th anniversary in 1985. The Royal and
Ancient Golf Club, the ruling authority of the sport for most of the world, is
situated at St Andrews on the east coast. Golf is played throughout Britain and
there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns, some of them owned by local
authorities. The main event of the British golfing year, and considered by many
to be the world’s leading tournament, is the Open Golf Championship; other
important events include the Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup
match for professionals, which are played between Britain and the United States
and Europe and the United States respectively. Among the leading British
professional players are Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo, Mark James, Brian Barnes,
Bernard Gallagher and Sam Torrance.
Variants of hockey have been played in Britain for at least five centuries, and
some, like hurling in Ireland and shinty in Scotland, are still played. The modern
game was started in the nineteenth century by the Hockey Association (of
SPORT AND RECREATION
439
Ice Skating
Judo
Lawn Tennis
England), which was founded in 1886. There are similar associations in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Some 1,000 men's hockey clubs are located
throughout Britain, many of which have women's and junior sections; large
numbers of boys’ schools also play the game. Cup competitions and leagues are
played at national, division or district, and club levels both indoors (six-a-side)
and outdoors, and there are regular international matches.
The controlling body of women's hockey in England is the All-England
Women's Hockey Association (founded in 1895) to which are affiliated some
1,000 clubs and about 2,400 schools; there are similar associations in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland. County, club and school championships for both outdoor and
indoor hockey are played annually in England. The first international women’s
hockey match took place in 1896; nowadays the main international match is
played each year at Wembley Stadium.
Men’s and women’s hockey are Olympic sports, and the British men’s team
won a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympic Games.
The Hockey Association will host the sixth World Hockey Cup for men in
October 1986 at the new national hockey centre in Willesden, north London.
Ice skating became popular in Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries and takes three main forms: ice dancing, figure skating and
speed-skating. The governing body for the sport is the National Skating
Association of Great Britain, founded in 1879. Participation in ice skating is
concentrated among the under-25s. There are some 40 ice rinks in Great
Britain, a small number compared with many other European countries. In
spite of this, British couples have won the world ice dance championship 17
times in its 32-year history, and Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean were world
ice dance champions for four successive years between 1981 and 1984,
European champions in 1981, 1982 and 1984, and gold medal winners at the
Sarajevo winter Olympic Games in 1984. Robin Cousins was the Olympic gold
medal winner for figure skating in 1980.
Judo, a modern combat sport derived from the ancient Japanese arts of ju-jutsu,
is growing rapidly in popularity in Britain, both as a sport and general fitness
training method and as a self-defence technique. Men and women take part in
judo at all levels, and in the last four Olympic Games judo has been one of
Britain’s most successful sports. Recent leading British exponents of the sport
include Brian Jacks, Neil Adams, Neil Eckersley, Karen Briggs and Diane Bell.
More than 1,000 judo clubs are registered with the British Judo Association
which is the official governing body of the sport throughout Britain.
Other martial arts, such as karate, kung fu and aikido, are attracting
increasing numbers of participants.
The modern game of lawn tennis originated in England in 1872 and the first
championships were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body in
Great Britain, the Lawn Tennis Association, was founded in 1888; Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Lawn Tennis Association. The main event of the
season is the annual Wimbledon fortnight, widely regarded as the most
important tennis event in the world; this draws large crowds, with the ground at
the All England Club accommodating over 30,000 spectators. There are also
national and county championships and national competitions for boys’ and
girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup and European Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete annually for the Wightman Cup.
Motor Sports Among the most popular spectator sports in Britain are motor racing and
440

Mountaineering
and Rock-
Climbing
Racing
rallying, and motor-cycle racing. The governing body for four-wheeled motor
sport is the RAC [Royal Automobile Club] Motor Sports Association. The
Association issues competition licences for a variety of motoring competitions
and organises both the RAC Rally, an event in the contest for the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix, held annually at the Silverstone
racing circuit as part of the Formula One World Motor Racing Championship.
British car constructors including Lotus, McLaren and Williams have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing, and Britain has had six world
champion motor racing drivers; Nigel Mansell and Derek Warwick are among the
most successful of current drivers. Other popular types of motor-car sport
include autocross, drag racing and karting.
Motor-cycle sport, governed by the Auto-Cycle Union, caters for all forms of
competition on two or three wheels, from speed trials to Grand Prix road racing.
The major events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, and the
British Grand Prix at Silverstone; there are also many world championship
events for trials, motocross, speedway and other sports.
The popularity of mountaineering and rock-climbing has increased steadily.
Clubs in the British Mountaineering Council and the Mountaineering Council of
Scotland, the representative bodies of the sport, number 330, ranging from
national clubs such as the Alpine Club (founded in 1857, the oldest moun¬
taineering club in the world) and the Scottish Mountaineering Club to small
regional clubs with 20 to 30 members. The National Centre for Mountain
Activities is at Plas-y-Brenin in north Wales, and climbing takes place at other
centres managed by the Sports Councils at Plas Menai (north Wales), Glenmore
Lodge near Aviemore in Scotland and Tollymore in Northern Ireland. A number
of local education authorities and national bodies such as the Outward Bound
Trust have also established mountaineering training centres. The most popular
areas in Britain for climbing include the Peak District of Derbyshire, the Lake
District, Snowdonia in north Wales and the Western Highlands of Scotland.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring mountain ranges
and climbing many of the great mountains of the world, achieving, for example,
the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, Everest in 1953, Kangchenjunga in
1955, Everest by its south-west face in 1975, and the south face of Gosainthan
(in the Himalayas) in 1982.
Horse-racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early November)
and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from late August to early June). The
Derby, run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other
classic races are; the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St Leger, run at
Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival Meeting held at Cheltenham in March. The Grand
National, run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the world's best-known steeplechase
and dates from 1837.
The Jockey Club administers all horse-racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis
of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses. Racing takes place on most
days (excluding Sundays) throughout the year and about 12,500 horses are in
training. British thoroughbreds continue to be a source of the world’s best
bloodstock.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (one of Britain s most
popular spectator sports) takes place at 98 tracks licensed by local authorities.
Meetings are usually held two or three times a week at each track with at least
ten races a meeting. The rules for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club, the sport’s judiciary body. The Stewards of the Club are

also responsible for overall administration and organisation. The representative
body is the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Horse riding takes a number of forms ranging from recreational riding to show
jumping. The art of riding is promoted by the British Horse Society, which is
concerned with the welfare of horses, road safety, bridleways and training. It
also runs the British Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire where
activities take place throughout the year. With some 38,000 members the
Society is the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club movements,
which hold rallies, meetings and competitions culminating in annual national
championships. Horse trials are held during the spring and autumn under the
auspices of the Society. Three-day events (comprising dressage, cross-country
riding and showjumping) held each year include those at Badminton (Avon) in
April; Windsor (Berkshire) in May; Bramham (Yorkshire) in June; Burghley
House (Lincolnshire) in September; and Wylye (Wiltshire) in October.
Showjumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association, which
has over 14,000 members and some 1,650 shows affiliated to it. The major show
jumping events each year include the Royal International Horse Show at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London, and the Olympia International Show Jumping Cham¬
pionships in London.
The authority responsible for equestrian competitions (other than racing) at
international level is the British Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates the
events of the British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association.
British equestrian teams have an outstanding record in international competi¬
tions: a British team won the three-day event world championship held in
Australia in 1986, and Virginia Leng won the individual gold medal. Silver
medals were won by both the three-day event and the showjumping teams at the
1984 Olympic Games, while Virginia Leng won the bronze medal in the
three-day event individual competition. Well-known show jumpers include
Lucinda Green, David Broome, Malcolm Pyrah, Harvey Smith and Nick Skelton.
Oarsmanship is taught in many schools, colleges and rowing clubs (including
women's clubs) throughout Britain. The governing body of the sport in England
is the Amateur Rowing Association, and there are similar bodies in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. There are about 480 rowing clubs, and each year
about 250 regattas and head races are held in England, Wales and Scotland
under Association rules.
The University Boat Race (between eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge) originated in 1829 and has been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River Race in March (also on the Thames) is
the largest assembly of racing craft in the world, with more than 420 eights
racing in procession. At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire, founded in 1839,
crews from all over the world compete each July in various kinds of race over a
straight course of 1 mile 550 yards (about 21 km).
The National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham, has
a rowing course of Olympic 2,000-metre standard, as does Strathclyde Park in
west-central Scotland. Britain won the gold medal in the coxed fours event at the
1984 Olympic Games.
Rugby football takes its name from Rugby School, in Warwickshire, where it was
first played in 1823. The game is played according to two different codes: rugby
union (a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while rugby league (a 13-a-side
game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs. Rugby union is played
under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union in England and similar bodies

in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Important domestic competitions include the
Divisional and County Championships in England, the national club knock-out
competitions in England and Wales and the Scottish League Cup Cham¬
pionship. The Five Nations Tournament between England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland and France is played each year and there are overseas tours by the
national sides and by the British Lions, a team representing Great Britain and
Ireland. In 1987, teams representing 16 countries will compete for the first time
for the Webb Ellis Trophy in a tournament to be held in Australia and New
Zealand.
Rugby league is played mainly in the north of England. The governing body of
the professional game is the Rugby Football League, which sends touring teams
representing Great Britain to Australia and New Zealand; annual matches are
also played against France. The Challenge Cup Final, the major club match of
the season, is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association; matches between
England and France take place each year. A national league consisting of ten
leading clubs is to be launched in autumn 1986.
Sailing has always been popular in Britain, and the Royal Yachting Association
(RYA) has more than 1,400 affiliated clubs. Over 1,000 practical or shore-based
teaching centres, including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of
Wight and the Scottish National Water Sports Training Centre in the Firth of
Clyde, offer RYA courses in all branches of the sport. One of the world’s principal
regattas takes place each summer at Cowes, and major events are held at other
sailing centres. British sailors have undertaken many notable voyages. Sir
Francis Chichester was the winner of the first single-handed transatlantic race
in 1960 and made a solo circumnavigation of the world in 1966-67. The first
non-stop solo circumnavigation was achieved by Robin Knox-Johnston in 1968.
In 1976 Clare Francis held the record for the fastest single-handed crossing of
the Atlantic, as did Naomi James in 1980. Rodney Pattison won gold medals in
the ‘Flying Dutchman' class at the Olympic regattas of 1968 and 1972 with his
crews Ian McDonald-Smith and Christopher Davies, and in 1976 Reg White,
crewed by John Osborne, won the gold medal in the Tornado’ catamaran class.
Jo Richards and his crew Peter Allam won a bronze medal in the Flying
Dutchman’ class in the 1984 Olympics. In 1985 the World Women’s Sailing
Championship was held at Largs in Scotland.
When there is sufficient snow, skiing takes place in several parts of Britain. The
governing body of the sport is the British Ski Federation and there are separate
national councils. Skiing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the
winter sports centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and
Glenshee, where ski-runs equal to those in other areas of Europe have been
developed. Ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction of a high quality are
now available. There are also some 100 artificial ski-slopes throughout Great
Britain. Interest in cross-country skiing has been increasing. There are over 200
ski clubs in Britain, and it is estimated that about half a million people take part
in the sport.
Squash rackets originated at Harrow School in the 1850s. The Squash Rackets
Association was formed in 1929 to promote and organise the men’s game and
there are separate governing bodies for Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The
governing body of women's squash in Britain is the Women's Squash
Association, founded in 1934. Squash enjoyed a period of very rapid growth
during the 1970s and remains a fast-developing sport. There are 9,000 squash

courts in England, and the estimated number of players in Britain is about
3 million. The main tournament is the British Open Championship.
Underwater activities are varied and include exploratory diving (for example,
wreck and reef diving), snorkel diving and underwater photography. The British
Sub-Aqua Club is the governing body for all underwater activities and promotes
underwater exploration, science and sport. The Club is the largest of its kind in
the world, with some 35,000 members and more than 1,000 clubs in Britain and
overseas. The Scottish Sub-Aqua Club governs the sport in Scotland.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn to
swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The Association
also controls swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo
championships and competitions in England. Separate associations control the
sport in Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish Amateur
Swimming Association. For major international competitions, such as the
Olympic Games and the world and European championships, England,
Scotland and Wales compete together as one team under the auspices of the
Amateur Swimming Federation of Great Britain. A number of British swimmers
have had great success and Duncan Goodhew won a gold medal at the 1980
Olympics. At the 1984 Olympics, Britons won a silver and four bronze medals.
Windsurfing, or boardsailing, was introduced to Britain from the United States
in 1974 and is one of the fastest-growing sports, with an estimated 100,000
participants. The sport takes place on the sea and on lakes and reservoirs
throughout the country. Racing is increasingly popular, and regattas are
organised by the governing body of the sport, the Royal Yachting Association,
and by the United Kingdom Boardsailing Association, which controls racing for
certain classes of boards. There are some 170 windsurfing schools recognised by
the RYA. Windsurfing is now an Olympic sport.
Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted in Britain under
strict regulations. Spending on gambling fell by about 14 per cent in real terms
in the ten years to 1984; in 1984—85 the total money staked (excluding gaming
machines) was about £6,000 million. It has been estimated that over 90 per cent
of adults gamble at some time or another, some 40 per cent regularly.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and card games, gaming machines and
licensed bingo, thought to be played by about 5 to 6 million people on a fairly
regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse or greyhound racing, and on
football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be made at
racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 11,000 licensed off-course
betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked. A form of pool
betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB contribute a levy to the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, which promotes the improvement of horse racing
and breeding and the advancement of veterinary science.
In addition, legislation allows local authorities and certain other bodies to
hold lotteries.
