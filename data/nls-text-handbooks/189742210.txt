Introduction
Britain 1981 is the thirty-second official handbook in the series; it has
been prepared and revised by Reference Division (now Reference
Services, Publications Division) of the Central Office of Information.
The handbook is widely known as an established work of reference
and is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by the British
Information Services in many countries. It is distributed overseas in a
limited free edition and is on sale by Her Majesty's Stationery Office
throughout the world.
Britain 1981 is primarily concerned to describe the machinery of
government and other institutions. It also provides some general
background, but does not attempt an analytical approach to current
events. The text, generally, is based on information available up to
September 1980.
Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note
whether they refer to England, to England and Wales (considered
together for many administrative and other purposes), to Great
Britain, which comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the
United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in Britain 1981 is compiled
with the co-operation of other government departments and agen¬
cies, and of many other organisations. Sources of more detailed and
more topical information (including statistics) are mentioned in the
text and in the Bibliography towards the end of the book.

THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, also known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands lying
off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest islands are Great
Britain (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and
Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the south¬
ern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the
Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by
numerous islands and to the north-east are the Orkneys and Shetlands. All
these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a
large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales,
Scotland or Northern Ireland.

1 Excludes the Isle of Man, 588 square km (227 square miles), and the Channel Islands, 194 square
km (75 square miles).
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the eastern¬
most point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point of
Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles)
from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest part. There are numerous
bays and inlets and no place is as much as 120 km (75 miles) from tidal
water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow—usually less than 90
metres (50 fathoms or 300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental
shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges
abruptly from 180 metres (some 600 feet) to 900 metres (about 3,000 feet).
These shallow waters are important because they provide breeding grounds for
fish. The North Atlantic current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
2
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Geology and Despite its small area, Britain contains rocks of all the main geological periods.
Topography In general, the oldest rocks appear in the highland regions in the north and
west, and the youngest in the lowland areas in the south and east. This is
mainly the result of persistent slow sinking over many millions of years in the
south and east accompanying the formation of the deep North Sea and English
Channel sedimentary basins.
Beneath the lowland areas in the south and east of England lie the younger
rocks. The harder chalk and limestone formations stand out as ranges of low,
grass-covered hills (rarely reaching 300 metres, 1,000 feet, above sea level)
separated by clay vales of rich farm land. These younger formations rest on an
old volcanic foundation present at a depth of a few hundred metres under much
of central England. This volcanic foundation, containing the oldest British
fossils, comes to the surface as craggy hillocks in north-west Leicestershire. At
greater depths beneath southern England lies the continuation of the older rock
formations of Belgium and the Rhineland.
The south-western peninsula of England, mainly the counties of Devon and
Cornwall, is composed of very old slate and sandstone formations into which
has been forced a large mass of metal-bearing granite whose outcrops now form
most of the high ground such as Dartmoor.
Still older rocks form most of the mountainous and hilly terrain in Wales, the
English Lake District, the southern uplands of Scotland and the southern
border counties of Northern Ireland.1 These rocks were subjected to compres¬
sions 400 million years ago which folded the strata and turned muddy sediment
into slate. In Wales and the Lake District thick volcanic formations, eroded by
rivers and Ice-Age glaciers, form spectacular mountain scenery.
Carboniferous limestone formations form the Mendip Hills, south of
Bristol, and the Pennines in northern England. In Scotland similar strata of a
partly volcanic character underlie the midland valley. These and other car¬
boniferous strata contain the coal measures which were the foundation of
British industrial expansion. The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which
have now largely been exhausted were found on the edge of the plains and up
the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the present deep coal workings lie
underneath the fertile lowlands. The continental shelf under the North Sea
contains large, exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas.
The Scottish Highlands are built from very thick formations of crystalline
rock, now deeply eroded, which was deposited between 1,000 million and 500
million years ago. Far older rocks, including the oldest in Britain, emerge from
beneath the Highlands on the north-western seaboard of Scotland and in the
Outer Hebrides, forming barren and rocky land. On the mainland of Scotland
a cover of red sandstone between 800 million and 1,000 million years old has
been partly eroded, leaving imposing isolated peaks.
Extensive areas in Antrim in Northern Ireland and in the islands of the Inner
Hebrides are composed of volcanic lava flows which erupted 50 million to 60
million years ago when the North Atlantic Ocean was in the process of opening
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 1,342 metres (4,406 feet); in Wales, Snowdon,
1,085 metres (3,560 feet); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumbria), 978
metres (3,210 feet). The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 852 metres (2,796
feet).

out. The lavas and the roots of the volcanoes which fed them are deeply eroded
into wild mountain scenery.
The landscape of Britain is mainly the result of cycles of uplift and erosion in
the past 25 million years, culminating in the last Ice Age. Around 750,000
years ago great glaciers built up in the mountainous areas of Britain and
Scandinavia and spread out as ice-sheets into the lowland areas. The moun¬
tains and the valleys were formed by the glaciers while the ice sheets deposited
a thick blanket of boulder clay, gravel and sand over the lowlands north of a line
from Bristol to London. Large lakes of meltwater held back by the ice gradu¬
ally dried up, leaving deposits of sand and silt. Throughout much of the
country the blanket of glacial debris affords soils of great fertility.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety of
scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, particu¬
larly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of the highland area often reach the coast
in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along much
of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features
in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the
limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales; the red sandstone
of St. Bees Head on the coast of Cumbria; and the vertically jointed lavas of
Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even around the lowlands
there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white limestone—the
chalk—forms white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles off the Isle of Wight;
while other parts of the south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or
shingle. The eastern coast of England between the Humber and the Thames
estuary is mostly low-lying, and for centuries some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the shores of Britain sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of
some British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic. The weather is subject to frequent
changes but to few extremes of temperature. Although the winds are largely
determined by those of the eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter
months easterly winds may bring cold, dry, weather which, once established,
may persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the
Azores high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course,
often passing entirely to the north of the country.
South-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an easterly
direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the spring
than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may differ
markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds are
generally stronger in the north than in the south, stronger on the coasts than
inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The strongest winds usually
occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only about 354 and 338 km
(220 and 210 miles) long respectively; those in Scotland (the Tay and the Clyde) are about 188 km
and 170 km (117 and 106 miles) long.

from about 29 km/h (18 mph) in January to about 19 km/h (12 mph) in August,
while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of London, the average
speed varies from about 15 km/h (9 mph) in January to about 12 km/h (7 mph)
in August. The stormiest region is along the north-west coast with over 40 gales
a year; south-east England and the east Midlands are the least stormy, with
gales occurring on about two days a year inland and on some 10 to 15 days on
the Channel coast. .

Near sea level in the west the mean annual temperature ranges from 8°C (46°F)
in the Hebrides to ii°C (52°?) in the extreme south-west of England; latitude
for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly temperature in
the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 3°C (37°?) during the
winter (December, January and February) to i2°C (54°F) during the summer
(June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the Isle of Wight, in the
extreme south, are 5°C (4i°F) and i6°C (6i°F). During a normal summer, the
temperature occasionally rises above 30°C (86°F) in the south, but tempera¬
tures of 32°C (90°F) and above are infrequent. Minimum temperatures depend
largely on local conditions, but -io°C (i4°F) may occur on a still, clear
winter’s night in inland areas. Lower temperatures are rare.
Britain has an annual rainfall of about 1,100 mm (over 40 inches), while
England alone has some 830 mm (about 33 inches). The geographical distribu¬
tion of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the
Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain
than the lowlands of the south and east. More than 4,000 mm (roughly 160
inches) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon, the Lake District and north¬
west Scotland during the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of
England record less than 550 mm (about 22 inches). Rain is fairly well distri¬
buted throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the driest
months and October to January the wettest. A period of as long as three weeks
without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited areas.
The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south to north, a
decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During May, June
and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration of sunshine
varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight—November, December and Janu¬
ary—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a day in some
parts of northern Scotland and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog in
winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe as a result of changes in
fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation. In London, for example,
the frequency of dense fogs in winter is about half what it was 20 years ago.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils. These
stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland, the Pennines,
the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east and
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valleys
and the plains where soils are deeper and richer; villages and towns are often
separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole of
lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except where
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Fauna
there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage has been
developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil of the
low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered the
greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests of
Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland. In the
course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished and, in
spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission in the past
60 years, woodlands now occupy only about 9 per cent of the land area. The
greatest density of woodland occurs in northern Britain, in some parts of
south-east England and on the Welsh border. Yet much of Britain appears to be
wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most
common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
The number of elms, however, especially in southern England, has been
severely reduced since the late 1960s by ‘Dutch’ elm disease.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton grass
in the wetter parts. Nearly 80 per cent of Britain however is used for agriculture
(including rough grazing land and woodland on agricultural holdings) with
most of the prime farming land in England. The amount of land in urban use is
less than a tenth of the agricultural land.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate and the even dis¬
tribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry up,
grassland is green throughout the year with many wild flowers from spring to
autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month without some flowers in
hedgerows and woodlands.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of the rest of
north-western Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger
mammals, including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have
become extinct; but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the
Scottish Highlands and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe
deer are found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and
fallow deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into
parks and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely
seen; there are foxes in most rural (and increasingly in urban) areas. Common
and grey seals may be seen on parts of the coast, though not usually in the same
localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs,
moles, squirrels (the imported grey much more numerous than the native red),
hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats. Less common species include the otter, the
pine marten and the polecat. Species which have established themselves in the
wild after escape from captivity include the muntjac, coypu and mink.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or passthrough, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, black¬
bird and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate
6
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
near houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings
which congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species
of birds have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to
their success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in
London there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result
of the improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution
measures. Some birds, however, particularly some of the larger species have
tended to decrease, but several species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have
re-established themselves after disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth
century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and game birds shot for sport in the open
season (these are protected when breeding by a close season).
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found, salmon, trout, pike, roach, dace
and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an intro¬
duced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
specially bred introductions for angling. In a number of rivers measures to
control pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous; in the
Thames in London, where pollution levels have been reduced to a quarter of
those in the 1950s, nearly 100 kinds of fish have been found, compared with
only one in 1958.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from continental Europe. Ireland has no snakes.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects. Among the largest are
the rare swallowtail butterfly (8-10 cm, 3-4 inches) and the stag beetle (6 cm,
2f inches). The insect fauna is less varied than that of continental Europe and
lacks a number of common European species. With modern methods of pest
control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of
diseases spread by insects are not common but there is some anxiety that
chemical protection against insects may be reducing the population of
creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn. These and other
effects of agricultural chemicals on wildlife are the subject of special govern¬
ment safeguards supported by the agricultural chemicals industry.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
their language and customs, crossed the Channel to England and conquered it
in 1066.

Numbers
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Corn¬
wall, the Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century reasonable contemporary estimates
put the population at about 65 million. The main factor in this gradual growth
of population was a slow natural increase, with high death rates and, in
particular, very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from the
continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times as, more recently,
has immigration from Commonwealth countries.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century there is relatively plentiful and
reliable information about the British people—their number, sex, age, geo¬
graphical distribution, births, marriages, deaths, occupations, language, and
family structure. Most of it comes from two main sources: the regular flow of
statistical information based on compulsory registration of births, marriages
and deaths, and the periodic censuses taken regularly every ten years since
1801 (because of war there was no census in 1941). The last census was in 1971;
the next will be held in 1981.
Britain’s estimated mid-1979 home population was 55,883,000 (see Table 2).
The populations of the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey and associated
islands are about 60,500, 74,500 and 54,400 respectively. In the period
1975-78 for the first years since records began (other than in war) the

Birth Rates
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
population fell slightly, although it began to recover in 1979. The decline,
common to much of western Europe, was mainly the result of a sharp fall in the
birth rate (see below). Births in 1979 out-numbered deaths but the direction of
net migration, as in other recent years, was outward.
The total population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani ethnic origin
(including children born in Britain and children with only one parent of such
ethnic origin) was 1-9 million in 1978, about 3-6 per cent of the total population
of Great Britain.
Projections for the future suggest that population growth will take place at a
much slower rate than was expected a few years ago. Britain’s total population
is expected, on 1979 estimates, to be 56-4 million in 1986, 58-4 million in 2001
and 60 million in 2019.
The country as a whole has a population density of about 236 people to the
square kilometre (611 per square mile), but in England the figures are 355
people to the square kilometre (920 per square mile), and in Greater London
4,378 people per square kilometre (11,347 Per square mile).
Annual births have fallen by some 30 per cent since the mid-1960s. The birth
rate declined from 17-8 live births per 1,000 people in 1966 to 11 -6 in 1977, an
unprecedentedly low figure. The most recent information suggests that the fall
in the birth rate has come to an end; births in England and Wales rose in 1978
for the first time since 1964. In 1979 there were 638,000 live births (compared
with 849,823 in 1966), of which over 10 per cent were illegitimate, and the
birth rate was 13.
Several factors may have contributed to the fall in the birth rate. Family
planning, particularly the use by women of the contraceptive pill, has become

more widespread, and sterilisation of men and women has also become more
common. An appreciable proportion of pregnancies (nearly 40 per cent of
those conceived outside marriage and about 8 per cent for those conceived
within marriage) are ended by legal abortion.
There are indications that the proportion of childless marriages may be
increasing a little, and for marriages which do produce children there is a
continuing tendency for the interval between marriage and the first birth to be
longer. The numbers of third and later children born have fallen substantially.
The biggest falls have been in the births of third and later children to manual
workers, but proportionately the pattern is broadly similar for all social classes.
The fertility of women born overseas, particularly those from the Irish
Republic, the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent, was shown in the
1971 census to be higher on average than that of the indigenous population, but
has since been falling. The population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani
ethnic origin contains a larger proportion of young people than the indigenous
population and so contributes disproportionately to the number of births.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is just over 69 years and for a woman
it is just over 76 years. The corresponding expectations in 1901 were 48 years
for men and 52 years for women. The improving health of the population has
had the effect of increasing young people’s chances of reaching the older
age groups. Life expectancy in the older age groups has increased relatively
little.
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 50 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population, reflecting the gradual ageing of the population
since there has been a considerable decline in mortality at most ages, particu¬
larly among children and young adults.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising stan¬
dards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from tuberculosis is a tiny fraction of what it was in the mid¬
nineteenth century, and mortality from acute infectious diseases in infancy has
virtually been eliminated. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under
one year old per 1,000 live births) was 13-3 in 1978; neonatal mortality (deaths
of infants under four weeks old per 1,000 live births) was 8-8; and maternal
mortality was o-i per 1,000 live births.
The mortality from each major cause often reflects factors directly linked to
occupation and the wide variations between the life patterns and living stan¬
dards of the different social classes.
Traditionally Britain has a net outflow of people to the rest of the world (net
loss by migration between 1871 and 1931 for instance was about 4 million)
though there have been exceptional periods—in the 1930s when there was a
considerable flow of refugees from continental Europe, and in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, mainly the result of a large influx of people from the West
Indies and the Indian sub-continent.
The traditional pattern of migration in Britain has been maintained in the
past few years.
Between 1969 and 1979 Britain lost nearly half a million people by migra¬
tion: 2-4 million emigrants and 2-0 million immigrants; in both totals about a
third of the people were returning to their country of origin.

Distribution of
Population
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are about 6 per cent more male than female births every year. Because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point, at
about 45 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number of
men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance of
women among the elderly. In the population as a whole there are more than 105
females to every 100 men.
Marriage trends since the 1930s have been towards a higher proportion of
people marrying and an earlier age pattern. The proportion of the population
of Great Britain who were or had been married rose from about 52 per cent in
1939 to 60 per cent in 1978, while the proportion of single persons (in the
population aged 15 years or over) fell from 33-3 per cent to 23-8 per cent.
Wide-ranging changes in family life appear to have occurred in the 1970s and
include a record decline since 1945 in rates of first marriage, particularly
among teenagers; later starts to family building; and a continued rise in the
proportions of people divorcing, including those divorcing for a second or
subsequent time, and of people marrying for a second or subsequent time. In
1978 just over 11 decrees of divorce were made absolute for every 1,000
married people in England and Wales, compared with 2 in 1961; some 85 per
cent of divorces in England and Wales in 1978 occurred among couples both of
whom were in their first marriage. The average age of people at the time
of divorce in England and Wales is about 38 for men and 36 for women.
Remarriage rates among younger divorced people are high, and births in
remarriage are likely to become a more important component of total births
in the future.
The estimated age distribution of the British population in mid-1979 was
roughly as follows; under 15 years, about 21 per cent; 15-64, 64 per cent; and
65 and over, 15 per cent. Some 17 per cent of the population were over the
normal retirement ages (65 for men and 60 for women).
The changing age structure has for the time being produced a balance
between those who are primarily producers of resources and those who are
primarily consumers that is more unfavourable than at any time since the early
1930s. This ‘dependency ratio’ of children and older people to the size of the
population of working age is, however, projected to fall from 67 per cent in
1976 to 58 per cent in 2001. This will be the result principally of the decreasing
proportion of children in the population.
Perhaps the main feature of the changing age structure is the increasing
number of elderly people, reflecting birth patterns in the early years of this
century and the final decades of the nineteenth. Between mid-1970 and mid-
1979 the number of people over the normal retirement ages rose by 9 per cent.
Proportionately there was a particularly large increase in the number of people
aged 85 and over, 25 per cent over the same period.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that of
all other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by country
is shown in Table 2 on p 7.
The standard regions of England, sub-divisions of the country used for most
statistical and economic planning purposes, have the following populations
(provisional mid-1979 estimates): East Anglia 1,863,200; East Midlands
3,765,800; Northern 3,087,400; North-West 6,476,100; South-East
I6,857,500; South-West 4,315,700; West Midlands 5,152,200; and Yorkshire
and Humberside 4,878,200.

Table 3 gives figures of some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half the
population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the industrial¬
ised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are: the central
lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the river Tyne down
to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel
coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the
eastern fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and the
far south-west. The seven major metropolitan areas which have been denoted
as ‘conurbations’ in successive population censuses accommodate a third of
Great Britain’s people while comprising less than three per cent of the total
land area. They are: Greater London, Central Clydeside, Merseyside, South
East Lancashire, Tyneside, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Most of
the mountainous parts including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland and the central Pennines, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. There has been a geographical redistribution of the population from
Scotland and the northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South-West
and the East Midlands. The proportion resident in Greater London and most
of the metropolitan counties of England has recently been falling. People,
particularly the young and skilled, have tended to leave city centres and
conurbations, although such migration may not necessarily mean a change of
job but rather an increase in the distance of travel to and from work. In other
cases it has been a consequence of falling employment in city centres, a trend
which has led to special measures, worked out for each city, to attract small
industries back there.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
was spoken by 21 per cent of the population (some 542,000 people) aged three
years and over at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh Language Council, an
official body, promotes the use of the language. The Welsh Language Act 1967
affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English in the administration of justice
and conduct of government business throughout Wales. The number of

bilingual schools is increasing. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in 1971,
mainly in the Highlands and western coastal regions, were able to speak the
Scottish form of Gaelic. A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the Irish
form of Gaelic. The Cornish variety of Celtic is no longer effectively a living
language, although there is a revival of cultural interest.
Some of the country’s ethnic minorities have their own languages, normally
as well as English. Among the Asian community, for example, the most usual
languages are Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali or Urdu.
Immigration into Britain is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971 and
administered according to rules made under it. The Act confers a right of
abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth, adoption, naturalisation or
registration or are children or grandchildren of such persons, on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who have been resident in
Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on Commonwealth citizens
with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those having this right of abode
are known as ‘patrials’. In general, others wishing to enter Britain for employ¬
ment must hold work permits. Exceptions include Commonwealth citizens
with a grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-free categories, and nation¬
als of European Community countries. The dependants of work permit hol¬
ders and of those who may enter without work permits may also be admitted, as
may the wives and children of men already settled in Britain and certain other
categories. A number of changes in the rules took effect in 1980.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born in the United King¬
dom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the
United Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant
exceptions, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen
otherwise than by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a
father who is a citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of Com¬
monwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children and
for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in
consequence of a United Kingdom adoption order; and, for aliens, by natural¬
isation. The requirements for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the
United Kingdom or a colony, good character, a sufficient knowledge of
English and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony. The
requirements for registration are similar except that most Commonwealth and
Irish citizens settled in Britain by 1973 have the right to be registered after
completing five years’ ordinary residence without satisfying any other
requirement. In 1979, 24,600 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation
and registration.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country (although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he
derives it becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the
United Kingdom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign
national. Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will
except in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained
naturalisation or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a
citizen is, however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or
acquires the nationality or citizenship of another country. Citizens of the other
independent Commonwealth countries are, in United Kingdom law, British
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy full political and civic
rights if resident in Britain.
A Government White Paper, published in 1980, contains proposals for
replacing the present nationality law with new legislation.
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
This section gives some points of general interest about household structure
and social characteristics in Britain as a background to the information given in
later chapters. It deals with topics in very broad and informal terms and many
exceptions apply to the generalisations.
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly through¬
out the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes
include two major wars, a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher
divorce rate, widening educational opportunities and technical progress, par¬
ticularly in communications and transport and a better standard of living. One
of the features of the change in social attitudes has been the development of a
more informed tolerance of others’ behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise
individuals with particular problems. Relationships between the generations,
too, are changing, and young people are more ready to criticise traditional
values and institutions and to seek greater influence in shaping society.
The following account applies primarily to Great Britain. Many of the same
factors are at work in Northern Ireland but their effect is modified by both the
Province’s history and the emergency of recent years.
Homes and the The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in
Environment families or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and
people in the armed services and in educational or other institutions. In 1978
eight out of ten people lived in a family unit headed by a married couple. Of
these nearly half contained one or two dependent children and a fifth had no
children. Only 2 per cent of people lived in households containing more than
one family, a proportion which has been falling as fewer young married couples
live with their parents. One in ten people lived with no family and 8 per cent
lived in a one-parent family.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from over
four persons in 1911 to 3-1 in 1961 and 2-7 in 1977 and 1978 largely reflecting
increases in the numbers of people living alone and the trend towards smaller
families. It is estimated that in 1978 22 per cent of households in Great Britain
consisted of one person only, 31 per cent of two, 17 per cent of three, 18 per
cent of four and 12 per cent of five or more. The number of one-parent families
has been increasing rapidly.
Three British households out of four live in houses rather than flats. Ter¬
raced housing, most of it built in the early years of the present century, still
provides accommodation for over a quarter of all households. In inner urban
areas, which have increasing priority in the Government’s housing and plan¬
ning policies, slum clearance and redevelopment have been major features of
post-1945 public housing programmes, but, with help from public funds, the
modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing has increasingly been
encouraged as an alternative to clearing and rebuilding. Emphasis in new
building is on low-rise, high density layouts, often incorporating gardens or
patios. Nearly half of Britain’s housing stock has been built since 1945.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has been
suburban. Many families now live in houses grouped in small terraces, or
H
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with gardens, and providing
two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from two to four bedrooms, a
bathroom, and one or two lavatories. Many such houses, built in the 1920s and
1930s, are located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads, but recent
patterns have involved housing estates set back from the main thoroughfares
with amenities such as health and community centres.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 94 per cent of house¬
holds in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and 94 per cent
sole use of an inside lavatory—high percentages by international standards.
Most housing built nowadays is centrally heated, and just over half of all
households now have central heating. About 57 per cent of British households
have a telephone, 57 per cent one or more cars, 91 per cent a refrigerator, 75 per
cent a washing machine, 32 per cent a deep freeze and 3 per cent a dish washer.
Over half of all families now own their own homes, though more than half of
these home owners still have further repayments of mortgages to make. Most of
the other households rent an unfurnished house or flat either from a local
authority or housing association (an increasing trend) or from a private land¬
lord (a falling trend). People in unskilled manual jobs are more likely to live in
rented accommodation, particularly local authority housing, than people
in non-manual occupations. One-third of all families move house every five
years.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership. Greater access to motorised transport and the
construction of a network of modern trunk roads and motorways have resulted
in a considerable increase in personal mobility and changed leisure patterns, as
well as changes in the design of housing and shopping areas. Most detached or
semi-detached houses in new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-town
shopping centres, frequently including large supermarkets, are often specially
planned for the motorist and offer an alternative to shopping in the centres of
older towns. The 32 new towns and the ‘expanding towns’ (generally seen as
one of the most successful achievements of British planning since 1945) have
set high standards in accommodating people and traffic.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution. Public transport, too, has been affected, and many
services have been reduced or eliminated, especially in rural areas. The people
without access to a car include those among the poorer sections of the com¬
munity, or the elderly or infirm; mobility allowances help the disabled.
Restrictions on bus licensing are being relaxed in order to make it easier for new
services to develop, and the Government is encouraging car-sharing on
journeys such as those to work. In a densely populated modern industrial
society there is much scope for conflict between the need for communal
facilities and the desire to preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest,
and between potential users of a new service and people whose way of life is
threatened by the need to accommodate it. As a result the activities of the
established amenity societies, such as the National Trust and the Council for
the Protection of Rural England, are supplemented to a growing extent by
those of groups formed expressly to safeguard the amenities of a particular area
and to publicise the views of the people they represent.
There has been a steady reduction of the main atmospheric and fresh water
pollutants that have been of concern in the past, producing dramatic improve¬
ments in, for example, the quality of the air in cities and the condition of the
river Thames. Long-established problems have not yet been entirely elimi-

nated, however, and controls are still necessary. There is also general recogni¬
tion of the need for more research into and monitoring of newer problems, such
as pollution from traffic, which are more difficult to control. Advice is pro¬
vided by the standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the
Noise Advisory Council. Voluntary societies include the National Society for
Clean Air, the Noise Abatement Society, the Keep Britain Tidy Group,
Friends of the Earth, and the Council for Nature.
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth century. Nonetheless considerable inequalities of income and
v/ealth, among them regional disparities, remain. The gap between social
classes in such matters as infant mortality rates, educational progress, working
conditions and ill-health remains wide and is increased by high unemployment
such as that accompanying the economic recession in the industrialised world
which began in 1979. There has, however, been a long-term tendency to a
reduction in the proportion of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and an
increasing number of people in professional or managerial occupations are
children of manual workers. One study showed that in each year between 1961
and 1978, in every 100 jobs, one manual job was supplanted by more highly
paid work.
The working population comprises nearly half the total population. For a
long period an increase in real earnings was a principal factor in British working
and social life. Between 1950 and 1974 real personal disposable income1 more
than doubled to £74,916 million (1975 prices). It fell in 1975, steadied in 1976
and fell again in 1977 but rose in 1978 and again in 1979 to £82,289 million.
The difference between average earnings of men in different occupations has
become less in the course of the present century. Income before tax of the
self-employed is more unevenly distributed than total income, largely because
of the very large incomes of a small number of people, mainly professionals
such as lawyers, accountants and some doctors. In the last 30 years, there has
been little change in the distribution of pre-tax income between the top and
bottom halves of the population. Successive falls in the share received by the
top 10 per cent have been retained largely in the upper half of the distribution.
Since 1949 the share received by the top 10 per cent fell from 33-2 per cent of
total pre-tax income to 26-2 per cent in 1977-78. The combined effect of the
tax system and the receipt of transfer payments and direct and indirect benefits
in kind is to redistribute incomes on a more equal basis.
There is very little knowledge about long-term trends in the distribution of
wealth, but such estimates as there are show a substantial fall in the share
owned by the richest people in the community. In 1976 about 25 per cent of
personal wealth was owned by the top 1 per cent of the adult population
(compared with over 30 per cent in 1966 and about 60 per cent in 1923).
Between 1966 and 1976 the share owned by the lowest 90 per cent increased
from 32 per cent to 40 per cent. The inclusion of state and occupational
pensions as a form of wealth lowers the share of the top 1 per cent by nearly a
half and nearly doubles the share of the bottom 80 per cent. The proportion of
personal wealth held in the form of physical assets rose from less than a third in
i960 to just under 50 per cent in 1976, reflecting especially the increasing
importance of dwellings. There has been a marked decline in the relative
importance of company securities in the composition of personal wealth.

The Role of
Women
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The volume of consumer spending in Britain, after allowing for inflation,
decreased in 1977 but rose in 1978 and again in 1979. Over the period 1970-79
there were some significant changes in the pattern of expenditure. The shares
spent on food, clothing and footwear and tobacco fell while those spent on
housing and on alcoholic drink, particularly wines and spirits, increased
substantially. A large increase in spending on radio and electrical goods was
mainly due to people buying music centres and other audio equipment, colour
televisions (well over half the television licences are issued for colour), and
more recently, video tape recorders. Expenditure on television rental, too,
more than doubled, while that on admission to cinemas, theatres, spectator
sports and the like increased by more than 38 per cent in real terms.
Some 12-5 million visitors to Britain in 1979 spent a total of £2,764 million.
More overseas visits than ever before were made by British residents, 15-5
million, 15 per cent higher than in 1978. Visits for holidays were the main
reason for this, undoubtedly helped by large reductions in some air fares; visits
for other reasons also increased but not as substantially. Following the pattern
of recent years, overseas visitors to Britain spent at a higher average rate per
visit than did British residents visiting overseas.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use
of convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods, in the 1960s has
been partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. Other trends
include the continuing popularity of health foods and slimming products, an
increase in the number of meals eaten away from home, either at work or in
restaurants, and a growth in consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and ‘fast
food’ shops. The last 20 years or so have seen a gradual decline in total food
supplies per person, which is regarded as consistent with reductions in physical
activity and the greater proportion of less active people in the population. The
trend is common to most developed countries.
Over the period 1968-78 total estimated consumption of beer (Britain’s
most popular alcoholic drink) rose by more than 25 per cent a head; that of
wine by 55 per cent (consumption of wine has, however, fallen by nearly 12 per
cent since 1976); and that of spirits by 93 per cent. A notable development in
the 1970s was the large increase in consumption of lager, now estimated to
account for a quarter of the beer consumed.
The greatest social changes have probably been in the economic and domestic
lives of women. Almost all theoretical sex discrimination in political and legal
rights has been removed.
The changes have been significant but, because tradition and prejudice can
still handicap women in their working careers and personal lives, major legisla¬
tion to help to promote equality of opportunity and pay was passed during the
1970s.
At the heart of women’s changed role in society has been the rise in the
number of women at work, particularly married women. As technology and
society permit highly effective and generally acceptable methods of family
planning there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved
in child-bearing for a much shorter time and, related to this, there has been a
rapid increase, which is still continuing, in the number of women with young
children who return to work when their children are old enough not to need
constant care and attention.
Since 1951 ^he proportion of married women who work has grown consider¬
ably, to more than half of those under 45 and three-fifths of those between 45
and 60. The proportion of the total workforce accounted for by married women
Ethnic and
National
Minorities
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE 17
increased from 4 per cent in 1921 to an estimated 27 per cent in 1979.
Compared with their counterparts elsewhere in the European Community,
British women comprise a relatively high proportion of the workforce, about
two-fifths (only Denmark has a comparable percentage). There is still a
significant difference between women’s average earnings and men’s, but the
equal pay legislation which came into force at the end of 1975 appears to have
helped to narrow the gap between women’s and men’s basic rates. During the
1970s women’s wages rose proportionately more than men’s but remain rela¬
tively low because women tend to work in lowly-paid sectors of the economy,
they often work in predominantly female workforces, and they work less
overtime than men.
Women’s average hourly earnings, exclusive of overtime (for full-time
employees), increased from just under two-thirds of those of men in 1970, to
about three-quarters in 1980.
As more and more women joined the workforce in the 1960s and early 1970s
there was an increase in the collective incomes of women as a whole and a major
change in the economic role of large numbers of housewives. Families have
come to rely on married women’s earnings as an essential part of their income
rather than as ‘pocket money’ or a means of buying ‘extras’. At the same time
social roles within the family are increasingly being shared.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the last
hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some to
avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life and
an escape from poverty.
Many Irishmen have made homes in Britain, and comprise the largest single
minority group. Many Jewish refugees started a new life in the country towards
the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s, and after 1945 large
numbers of other European refugees, Poles in particular, also came to settle.
The large communities from the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent
date from the 1950s and the early 1960s. There are also sizeable groups of
Americans, Australians, Chinese and various European communities such as
Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. Most recently, refugees
from Indo-China have found new homes in Britain. In the last generation
British society has therefore become more multi-racial as ethnic minority
groups from almost all parts of the world have made a permanent home in the
country. Although a small proportion of the total population, they represent a
significant element in certain areas.
The minority communities tend to live mainly in the urban centres, especi¬
ally the largest towns, and in particular areas within these centres. The most
recent immigrants, such as the West Indians and the Asians, are usually
concentrated in the poorer inner city areas, whereas earlier arrivals have tended
to move out to the suburbs.
Most minorities share a way of life that is broadly similar to that of the British
community as a whole, though some of the newer arrivals, mainly from
Commonwealth countries and sometimes with a poor command of the English
language, may face problems of limited employment opportunities and in¬
adequate housing. Many have, however, opened small family businesses such
as general stores and restaurants which widen the range of choice and services
for local communities. In areas with large and fairly recently-arrived immi¬
grant populations arrangements are made in schools and elsewhere to enable
host and minority communities to understand each other’s traditions better
and to help immigrants who need special language training.
i8
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Leisure Trends Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of
full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer (about 45 on average for manual workers)
because of voluntary overtime work, while the hours worked by women and
girls average somewhat less. Most employees work a five-day week.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year in
addition to public holidays and in practically every case the minimum period is
three weeks.
The number of holidays (of four or more nights) taken in Great Britain by
British residents was 44 million in 1979 compared with 31 million in 1966.
More than two holidays in five in Great Britain are spent at the home of a friend
or relative, and a quarter involve camping or caravanning. Holidays abroad in
1979 numbered 9-9 million, compared with 5-5 million in 1966, and well over
half involved ‘package’ arrangements. Spain is by far the most popular destina¬
tion, and receives well over a quarter of all British holiday-makers abroad. A
third of the population each year, however, takes no holiday away from home.
Leisure patterns generally are determined by age, sex, social class, income,
access to a car and education. The most common activities are home based, or
social, with television-watching the most popular; about 98 per cent of house¬
holds have a television set and in winter the population aged five and over
spend on average 20 hours a week watching programmes.
Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio, records or tapes;
reading; do-it-yourself (DIY; work done by amateur handy-men such as
painting and decorating their homes); photography, needlework and many
other hobbies; going out for a meal or for a drink to a public house (the ‘pub’ or
‘local’ is a traditional social centre for many people); gardening (a majority of
British families have some garden or allotment despite the high proportion
living in urban areas); open-air outings; games and sports (as both spectators
and participants); dancing; going to social clubs1 and leisure centres; cinema
going (especially among young people); visits to buildings and museums; and
social and voluntary work. The social activity with perhaps the largest partici¬
pation is the visiting or entertaining of friends or relatives.
These include clubs run by political groups; trade unions; church groups; social, cultural and
academic groups; youth clubs and organisations; and groups of local business and professional
people. The longer-established clubs organised on a national basis include the Working Men’s
Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the Women’s Institutes.

Constitution
GENERAL SURVEY
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each of its
four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales formally
became part of the kingdom in 1536. The thrones of England and Scotland
were dynastically united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in the two
countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of Great Britain
with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in Scotland. Ireland
had had links with the kingdom of England since the thirteenth century, and in
1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was completed by a union joining the
Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain. In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the
Irish Republic) became a self-governing country. The six counties of Northern
Ireland had in 1920 been given their own subordinate Parliament, and voted to
remain within the United Kingdom.(Arrangements in Northern Ireland,
where divisions between the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic
minority, deeply-rooted in history, are still an important factor, are described
on p 54.)
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London—with an
elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies—therefore represents people whose back¬
grounds and traditions vary considerably from one part of the country to
another. It has ultimate authority for government and law-making, but
administrative arrangements have developed in such a way as to take account of
the particular needs of different areas.
Referenda under the Scotland and Wales Acts were held in 1979 to assess
support for the elected assemblies with devolved powers which were to have
been set up in Edinburgh and Cardiff. The results showed insufficient support
(less than 40 per cent), and so the Acts were repealed.
Subsequently, ways are being considered by which the parliamentary
administration of Scotland might be improved. The Government is holding
talks with other political parties to find the best means of doing this.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, and
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of the
antiquity of their connection with the Crown. The United Kingdom Govern¬
ment is responsible for their defence, their international relations and, ulti¬
mately, their good government. They have separate arrangements with the
European Community which take into account their special relationship with
the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by conventions, which have never been codified and
are not directly enforceable in a court of law, but which, nevertheless, are
regarded as rules of the constitution. Because the constitution is not contained
20
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in any single document, and because it can be altered by the passing of an Act of
Parliament or by general agreement to vary, abolish or create a convention, it
can the more readily be adapted to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are readily distinguishable although their func¬
tions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, the supreme authority in the realm (see p 24);
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Government—that is the Cabinet
and other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and
directing national policy (see p 36); (b) government departments, most of
them under the direct control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants,
which are responsible for administration at the national level (see p 40); (c)
local authorities, which administer and manage many services at the local
level (see p 60); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible for
the operation of particular nationalised industries or, for example, of a
social or cultural service, and which are subject to ministerial control in
varying degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and, in spite
of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon
which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and
Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. The
form of the royal title is varied for those other member States of the Common¬
wealth of which the Queen is head of State,1 to suit the particular circum¬
stances of each. (For a full list of members of the Commonwealth see p 77.)
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the
other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of
State, her representative is the Governor-General, who is appointed by her on
the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent
of the United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies
the Queen is usually represented by governors appointed by the Crown, with
various executive and legislative powers, and responsible to the United King¬
dom Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
Succession, The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common law
Accession and rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the Elec-
Coronation tress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England and VI of Scotland)
are alone eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue
in its present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common consent of
the member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of State.
1 The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is head of State are: Australia,
Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu.
GOVERNMENT
21
Acts of
Government
Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of
succession to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the
daughters succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully
and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king
takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does not apply
and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he fills an important role
in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the
accession of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the
new Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and
the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, follows
the accession after an interval of possibly a year or more. The ceremony has
remained much the same in substance for over a thousand years although the
details have frequently been modified to conform with the customs of the time.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests in
the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading citizens of the other
Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
‘governor’ of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. The United Kingdom is governed by
Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred years
towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity for royal
intervention, there are still important acts of government which require the
participation of the Queen. These include the summoning, prorogation and
dissolution of Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by both Houses of
Parliament; making appointments to all important State offices, including
those of government ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors,
diplomats and all the leading positions in the established Church of England;
conferring peerages, knighthoods and other honours1; and remitting all or part
of the penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. An important function
is the appointment of the Prime Minister. This is normally automatic, and the
Queen must invite the leader of the political party commanding a majority in
the House of Commons to form a government. If, however, no party has a
majority, or if the majority party has no recognised leader, the Queen must
select a Prime Minister, and can consult anyone she wishes. In international
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, a few are
conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order
of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

affairs, the Queen as head of State has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign States and governments, to conclude treaties and to
annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are now¬
adays exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliament
and can be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not
require Parliament’s prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but
Parliament has the power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative
right.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not,
however, detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation in the
smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable State papers; she must be informed and consulted on every aspect
of the national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is totally
incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne). The
regent would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, and thereafter
those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s
partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of
Counsellors of State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in
succession to the Crown, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may
delegate certain royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however,
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or
create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and, in
spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain. Royal marriages
and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The birthday of the
Sovereign is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the
Horse Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United
Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions
add significance to such occasions as the opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace. The Queen and other mem¬
bers of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every year, and
their presence at scientific, artistic, industrial and charitable events of national
importance encourages nationwide interest and publicity. The Queen pays
State visits to foreign governments, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh,
and undertakes lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other
members of the royal family pay official visits overseas.
More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
the royal family is borne on the accounts of public departments—including,
for example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train and
the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen’s public expendi¬
ture on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out offical duties as head of
State is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament. Her private
expenditure as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied
24

mainly from the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster1; and her personal
expenditure as a private individual from her own personal resources. Annual
allowances approved by Parliament are made to certain other members of the
royal family. No allowances are made to the Prince of Wales, who as Duke of
Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall
(he has voluntarily surrendered half the revenue to the nation). The Queen
meets from her Privy Purse the official expenses of members of the royal family
for whom Parliament has not provided.
PARLIAMENT
Parliament is the supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom. The
three elements of Parliament, the Queen, the House of Lords and the elected
House of Commons, are outwardly separate; they are constituted on different
principles; and they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance
such as the State opening of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by
the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however,
Parliament as a rule needs the concurrence of all its parts.
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, for any of the constituent parts of the country separately, or for any
combination of them. It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, which are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom,
having subordinate legislatures which make laws on island affairs.2
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the
legislatures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is free to
legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law; to legalise
past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when done and
thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy established
conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong its own life
beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way.
Its members bear in mind the common law and have tended to act in accord¬
ance with precedent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of
Parliament that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by
the proper authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would
be likely to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The
system of party government helps to ensure that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises
the various types of Community legislation, and sends 81 elected members to
the European Parliament (see p 74).
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of the
community, (2) to provide, by voting taxation, the means of carrying on the
work of government; and (3) to scrutinise government policy and administra-

administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy.
t TheATslatUreS °f the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and the

island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

tion, particularly proposals for expenditure. In discharging these three func¬
tions Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the elector¬
ate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all
important international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being,
in theory at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Govern¬
ment and not subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five years, but is often dissolved and a
general election held before the end of this term. The maximum life has been
prolonged by legislation in such rare circumstances as the two world wars.
Dissolution is ordered by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. A
royal proclamation dissolves the existing Parliament, orders the issue of writs
for an election, and announces the date on which the new Parliament is to meet
(not less than 20 days after the dissolution).
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late (English) Spring Bank Holiday and during a long summer recess
starting in late July or early August. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a
session is about 175 in the House of Commons and about 140 in the House of
Lords. At the start of each session the Queen’s speech to both Houses of
Parliament outlines the Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative
programme. Each session is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act
which appoints the day of meeting in a new session. Parliament then ‘stands
prorogued’ until the new session opens (on rare occasions Parliament has been
dissolved without prorogation). A short speech is made on behalf of the Queen
summarising Parliament’s work during the past session. Whereas an adjourn¬
ment does not affect uncompleted business, the effect of a prorogation is at
once to terminate nearly all parliamentary business, so that all public Bills not
completed in the session lapse, and must be reintroduced in the next unless
they are to be abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Tem¬
poral consist of (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom who have not disclaimed their peerages
under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life peers and peeresses created by the
Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3) those Lords of Appeal (‘law
lords’) created life peers under the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts 1876 and 1887
(as amended) who are appointed to assist the House in its judicial duties.
Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to sit in the House of Lords
(subject to certain statutory disqualifications), provided the holder is 21 years
of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of
succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their
right to sit in the House of Lords but they gain the right to vote at
parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to the House of
Commons. Eighteen peers have so far disclaimed. No hereditary peerage has
been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings.
Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence for the
duration of a Parliament.

The House of
Commons
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily attend¬
ance is about 290) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives
in public service. Lords receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but are
entitled to recover expenses incurred in attending the House (except for
judicial sittings) and certain travelling expenses.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. When the Lord
Chancellor is absent, his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed by
the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a deputy
speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the Lords
present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees,
who is appointed at the beginning of each session and takes the chair in all
committees, unless the House decides otherwise. The Lord Chairman and the
Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees are salaried officers of the House.
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings including judgments and for the promulga¬
tion of Acts of Parliament; the other Clerks at the Table who with him and the
other officers and officials of the House are collectively known as the Parlia¬
ment Office; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is also Serjeant-at-
Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor and who is responsible for
security and for accommodation and services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster, and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-
Arms and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by universal
adult suffrage and consists of men and women (members of Parliament,
‘MPs’) from all sections of the community. There are 635 seats in the House
of Commons (516 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, and 12 for
Northern Ireland1).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Queen. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the
death or resignation2 of an MP, or as a result of his elevation to the House of
Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary of £11,750
(to be increased to £13,150 in 1981) and an allowance for secretarial and
research expenses. They also have a number of other allowances, including
travel allowances, a supplement for London members and, for provincial
members, subsistence allowances. (For ministers’ salaries, see p 38.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected by
the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and two deputy chairmen who
act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the nomina¬
tion of the Government and, like the speaker, neither speak nor vote other than
in their official capacity. The House is administered by a statutory Commis¬
sion chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official department under his control and is the
Under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979 the number of parliamentary
constituencies in Northern Ireland is being increased from 12 to 17.
2 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so only by using the technical device of
aPP*ying f°r an office under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward of the Manor
of Northstead), ancient offices which disqualify the holder from membership of the House but
which carry no salary and have no responsibilities.

accounting officer for the two House of Commons Estimates, and the
Serjeant-at-Arms, who waits upon the Speaker, carries out the orders of the
House, is the official housekeeper of the Commons part of the building, and is
responsible for its security.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into geographical areas
known as constituencies, each of which returns one member to the House of
Commons. To ensure equitable representation, four permanent Boundary
Commissions for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make
periodic reviews of constituencies and recommend any redistribution of seats
that may seem necessary in the light of population movements or for some
other reason.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot. British
subjects (including Commonwealth citizens) and citizens of the Irish Republic
are entitled to vote provided they are aged 18 years or over, are resident in the
United Kingdom, are registered in the annual register of electors, and are not
subject to any disqualification. People not entitled to vote in a parliamentary
election are members of the House of Lords, sentenced prisoners and those
convicted within the previous five years of corrupt or illegal election practices.
Service voters (that is, members of the armed forces and their spouses, Crown
servants and staff of the British Council employed overseas, together with their
wives and husbands if accompanying them) may also be registered for an
address in a constituency, if they normally live there.
Each elector may cast one vote. Normally this is done in person at a polling
station. Service voters resident abroad or merchant seamen may vote by proxy
or, if in the United Kingdom at the time of the election, by post. Electors who
are physically incapacitated or unable to vote in person, because of the nature
of their employment, are also entitled to vote by post.
Voting is not compulsory; nearly 76 per cent of a total electorate of almost 41
million people voted in the general election of May 1979. The candidate who
polls the most votes in a constituency is elected; an absolute majority (that is,
more votes than those cast for all other candidates combined) is not required.
British subjects and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to stand and be
elected as members of Parliament provided they are aged 21 years or over and
are not subject to any disqualification. Those disqualified include, among
others, undischarged bankrupts, clergy of the Church of England, Church of
Scotland, Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Church, peers, and certain
people holding offices of profit under the Crown. The House of Commons
Disqualification Act 1975 defines those who may not become members of
Parliament. They include holders of judicial office, civil servants and some
local government officers, members of the regular armed forces, members of
the police forces and some members of public corporations and government
commissions. A candidate’s nomination for election must be supported by the
signatures of a nominator, a seconder and eight assentors registered in
the constituency. He or she does not require any party backing. A candidate is
also required to deposit the sum of £150, which is forfeited if the candidate’s
votes do not exceed 12-5 per cent of the total of those validly cast in the
election.
The maximum sum of money a candidate may spend on an election cam¬
paign is £1,750, plus 12 pence for each elector in a borough constituency or 2
pence for each elector in a county constituency. A candidate may send free of
postal charges an election address to each elector in the constituency. All other
expenses of up to £100 must not exceed the statutory limit.

The Party
System
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system relies heavily upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying its own policies before the electorate. These parties are not
registered or formally recognised in law, but in practice most candidates in
constituency elections, and almost all winning candidates, belong to one of the
main political parties, and the electorate indicates which of the different
policies it would like to see put into effect.
The percentages of votes cast for the main political parties in the last general
election held in May 1979 and the resulting distribution of seats in the House of
Commons are given in Table 4.

" In September 1980, the state of the parties (excluding the Speaker and his three deputies) was as
follows: Conservative 337; Labour 267; Liberal n; Scottish Nationalist 2; Plaid Cymru (Welsh
Nationalist) 2; Official Unionist (Northern Ireland) 5; Democratic Unionist (Northern Ireland)
3; United Ulster Unionist 1; Ulster Progressive Unionist—elected as Ulster Unionist 1; Inde¬
pendent Socialist (Northern Ireland)—elected as Social Democratic and Labour 1; Independent
(Northern Ireland) 1.
The party which wins most seats (although not necessarily the most votes) at
a general election, or which has the support of a majority of members in the
House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of
the majority party is appointed Prime Minister by the Sovereign; and about
100 of its members in the House of Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including appointment to the Cabinet—see p 38)
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the
official Opposition with its own leader and its own ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the
members of any other parties or any independents who have been elected may
support or oppose the Government according to their party or their own view
of the policy being debated at any given time. Leaders of the Government and
Opposition sit on the front benches of the Commons with their supporters (the
back-benchers) sitting behind them. Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply in the House of Lords; however, Lords who do not wish to be associated
with either the Government or the Opposition may sit on the cross benches of
the Chamber.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests largely on the
GOVERNMENT
Parliamentary
Procedure

relationship between the Government and the opposition parties. Depending
on the relative voting strengths of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition might seek to overthrow the Government by securing its defeat on
a ‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its aims are to contribute to the
formulation of policy and its expression in legislation by constructive criticism
of the Government’s approach; to oppose specific government proposals that it
considers objectionable; to secure concessions on government Bills; and to
increase support outside Parliament and enhance its chances of success in
by-elections or at the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses, by the
Chief Government Whips in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips.
The Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in
each of the Houses when the question of the possibility of finding time for
debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the
Houses is primarily the responsibility of the Leaders of the Houses and it is
their duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which they are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Chief Government Whip in the House of Com¬
mons is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government
Whips, three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal
Household, five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
and five are Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief Opposition
Whips in both Houses and to two of the Assistant Whips for the Opposition in
the Commons. The Government Whips in the Lords hold offices in the Royal
Household and act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at least
two members elected at the last general election or one member elected and a
minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: £550 for every seat and £1 -io
for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £165,000.
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and precedent, partly formulated
in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The system of
debate is much the same in the two Houses: the subject of every debate
originates in the form of a motion (a proposal made by a member in order to
elicit a decision from the House). When a motion has been moved and
seconded, the Speaker proposes the question as the subject of debate. Mem¬
bers speak from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum.
Questions are decided by a vote, a simple majority being required to affirm or
negative a question. The main difference between the two Houses is that in the
Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no authority to check or curtail
debate, such matters being decided by the general sense of the House, whereas
in the Commons the Speaker has full authority to give effect, promptly and
decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. The Speaker must guard
against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority rights, and has
discretion to allow or disallow any closure motion (that is, a motion to end
3°
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote). The Speaker has certain
powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save time in
various other respects. In cases of grave disorder the House can be adjourned
or the sitting suspended on the Speaker’s own initiative. Voting in the House of
Commons is under the direction of the Speaker whose duty it is to pronounce
the final result. In the event of a tied vote the Speaker must give the casting
vote, but he does so only in accordance with well-established conventions
which preclude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in
the House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original,
but no casting vote. The general principle is that Bills and subordinate legis¬
lation are allowed to proceed in the form before the House unless a majority
votes to reject or amend them; on other motions the question is decided in the
negative unless there is a majority in favour. When the House is sitting judici¬
ally (see pp 111 and 122) the judgment under appeal is not changed if the votes
are equal.
The House of Commons has a public register of members’ pecuniary inter¬
ests. Members with a relevant pecuniary interest in a matter before the House,
whether direct or indirect, must declare it when taking part in debate, though
in order to operate as a disqualification from voting the interest must be direct,
immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character. In
any other proceedings of the House or in transactions with other members or
with ministers or civil servants, MPs must also disclose any relevant pecuniary
interest or benefit.
All proceedings of both Houses are public, except on extremely rare
occasions; the minutes (in the Commons called Votes and Proceedings and in
the Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of
Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily. The records of the
Lords from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of certain past members of the Houses, are
available to the public in the House of Lords Record Office. There are radio
broadcasts of some of the proceedings of both Houses but no television
transmissions.1 A Parliamentary Sound Archive has been established.
Legislative The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles are
Proceedings interpreted, clarified or reapplied to meet new circumstances, but substantial
changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public
Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private
Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or by a private
member of either House who does not hold office in the Government. Most
public legislation is in practice drafted on behalf of ministers, and has the
support of the Cabinet before being presented to Parliament.
Before a Government Bill is finally drafted, there is normally considerable
consultation with, for instance, professional bodies, voluntary organisations
and other agencies interested in the subject matter of the proposals, such as
Debates on televising parliamentary proceedings have taken place on several occasions in recent
years and in 1968 an internal television experiment took place in the Lords. In January 1980 the
Commons voted to allow the introduction of a private member’s Bill to permit the televising of
proceedings, but it progressed no further.
GOVERNMENT
31
major interest groups and ‘pressure’ groups which aim to promote a specific
cause. Proposals for legislative changes are sometimes set out by the Govern¬
ment in ‘White Papers’ which may be debated in Parliament before the intro¬
duction of a Bill. From time to time consultative documents, sometimes called
‘Green Papers’, are published setting out for public discussion major minis¬
terial proposals which are still at the formative stage.
Public Bills can be introduced in either House. As a rule, however,
Government Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often
pass through the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose is nearly
always introduced in the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation must be
based on resolutions agreed to by that House, often after debate, before it can
be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a public charge, it can only
be introduced by a government minister or, if brought from the Lords, be
proceeded with in the Commons if taken up by a minister, which gives the
Government considerable control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot for
precedence in introducing a Bill on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. A private member may also present a Bill after question
time (see p 34) on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill under the ‘ten
minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one against the
measure, after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill to be brought
in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a few become law
each session. If one secures a second reading, the Government usually intro¬
duces any necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be intro¬
duced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the time that can
be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and after a
while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill)
is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles and merits. In
the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second reading
committee to recommend whether it should be taken as read a second time.
After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually referred for detailed
examination to a standing committee (see p 33). If the House so decides, the
Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in committee. The House may
vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a timetable
motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. In the Lords a Bill is considered
by a committee of the whole House as a matter of course, unless the House
takes the rare decision of referring it to a Public Bill Committee. The
committee stage is followed by the report stage, during which previous
amendments may be altered and new amendments incorporated. At the third
reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken
without a debate unless there is a motion in the name of six members that the
question ‘be not put forthwith’—a procedure frequently used.
After the third reading a Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes
through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts in the Lords and
is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there.
Amendments made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first,
or a compromise be reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through
the Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature.
However, should any non-governmental Lords Bill be unacceptable to the

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commons it would not generally become law because no debating time would
be allotted to it. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot in general prevent a Bill
insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events they either accept a Commons Bill without changes, or they
amend and return it for consideration by the Commons, who frequently agree
to the amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass without amendment
such financial Bills as the Finance Bill, which authorises taxation, or Consoli¬
dated Fund or Appropriation Bills, which authorise national expenditure. A
Bill that deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one
month of being sent to the Lords, whether or not they have agreed to it, unless
the Commons directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached between the two
Houses on a non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords
can in practice delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At
the end of this time it becomes law in the form originally passed by the
Commons. Bills to lengthen the life of a Parliament require the full assent of
both Houses in the normal way. The limitations on the power of the Lords are
based on the belief that the principal legislative function of the non-elected
House nowadays is to act as a chamber of revision, complementing, not
rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known as
an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard. Both
parties may be legally represented.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, gives ministers and other authorities the power to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in Coun¬
cil or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to government
ministers, government departments for which ministers are responsible, or to
certain statutory organisations. Moreover, the Acts of Parliament by which
particular powers are delegated normally provide for some measure of
parliamentary control over legislation made in the exercise of these powers, for
instance, by reserving to Parliament the right to affirm or annul the orders
themselves. Certain Acts also require direct consultation with organisations
which will be affected before rules and orders (in the form of statutory
instruments) are made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of
statutory instruments. In order to save time, the Commons also uses standing
committees to consider the merits of instruments, with any decisions reserved
to the House.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee (known as a committee of the
whole house) to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their second
reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the Chairman of
Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords) or a
deputy chairman.
GOVERNMENT

Standing
Committees
Select
Committees
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand
Committee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on, and are each
appointed specially to consider a specific Bill. Each has between 16 and 50
members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far as possible that in the
House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises all
71 Scottish members and 10 to 15 others, considers the principles of Scottish
Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and other
matters relating exclusively to Scotland. The Welsh Grand Committee, with
all 36 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills referred to it at
second reading stage, and matters relating exclusively to Wales. The Northern
Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to the province. A
standing committee on regional affairs comprising the 516 members from
English constituencies considers matters relating to the English regions. The
Lords equivalent to a standing committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely
used.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration
and reporting to the House or to consider matters concerning the work of the
House itself. They may be appointed as occasion demands, or for a session, or
for the rest of the life of a Parliament. On rare occasions a parliamentary Bill is
examined by a select committee (a procedure additional to the usual legislative
process). Select committees are constituted in the Commons on a party basis,
in approximate proportions to party strength in the House.
A new structure of select committees was introduced in the Commons in
1979 when committees dealing with specific topics (for example, nationalised
industries and science and technology) were replaced by 12 new committees,
each of which examines the work of one of the main government departments.
Select committees on Scottish Affairs and on Welsh Affairs and a Liaison
Committee to consider general matters relating to the work of select
committees have also been established. Other committees include those on
European Legislation, Public Accounts, Members’ Interests and the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. The Committee of Selection
and the Standing Orders Committee have duties relating to private Bills, and
the Committee of Selection also chooses members to serve on standing and
select committees.
In their scrutiny of administrative activity and government policies, the
committees question ministers, senior civil servants and interested bodies and
individuals. They bring before Parliament and the public generally, through
their hearings and published reports, a body of fact and informed opinion on
many important issues and they build up considerable expertise in their
subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, there are the Appeal and Appellate Committees
in which the bulk of the House’s judicial work is transacted. There are
also committees on the European Communities (with seven sub-com¬
mittees), Unemployment, Science and Technology, House of Lords Offices,
Hybrid Instruments, Leave of Absence, Lords’ Expenses, Personal Bills,
Private Bills, Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure, Selection and Sound
Broadcasting.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint
committees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills
and delegated legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
unofficial party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists of the
back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party is a
corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when the
Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communica¬
tion between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when the
party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under the
direction of a Parliamentary Committee often referred to as the ‘shadow
Cabinet’.
The effectiveness of parliamentary control of the Government is a subject of
continuing discussion, both inside Parliament and in Britain generally. Con¬
trol of the Government is exercised finally by the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign by passing a resolution of ‘no
confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the Government considers so vital
to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’ or, ultimately, by
refusing to vote the money required for the public service. In addition to the
system of close scrutiny by select committees (see p 33) the House of Commons
offers a number of opportunities for a searching examination of government
policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back-benchers.
These include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday, Tues¬
day, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation, answer
questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible.
Parliamentary questions are one means of eliciting information about the
Government’s intentions, as well as a way of airing, and possibly securing
redress of, grievances brought to members’ notice by constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
open discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern. There
is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of the business of the day; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and summer) a day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, a member wishing to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, the MP asks the House for leave for the
motion to be put forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or it can be
given if 40 or more MPs support the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more
than ten support it and the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has
been given, the matter is debated for three hours, usually on the following
day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays time
for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate. (Scrutiny by small
committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure proposals.)
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the Queen s speech at the beginning of a session, during debates

or motions of censure for which the Government gives up part of its own time,
and during debates on the Government’s legislative proposals.
Opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided in the
House of Lords at daily question time, during debates on specific motions and
in ‘unstarred’ (that is, debatable) questions at the end of the day’s business.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 18, Finance.
The arrangements made in Parliament to keep the two Houses informed on
European Community developments, and to enable them to scrutinise and
debate Community policies and proposals include two select committees: a
House of Commons committee on European Legislation and a House of Lords
committee, with similar, but broader, terms of reference, on the European
communities. In addition Ministers make regular statements about Com¬
munity business.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) is an independent statutory officer whose function is to investi¬
gate complaints of maladministration when asked to do so by MPs on behalf of
members of the public. Powers of investigation extend to administrative actions
by central government departments but not to policy decisions (which are the
concern of the Government and can be questioned in Parliament) nor to
matters affecting relations with other countries. Complaints by British citizens
arising from dealings with British posts overseas are open to investigation in
some circumstances. The Commissioner has access to all departmental papers
and reports the findings to the MP who presented the complaint. The Com¬
missioner reports annually to Parliament and may submit other reports, for
example, of individual investigations.
A select committee of the House of Commons makes recommendations over
the Commissioner’s work but does not review individual cases.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. Those rights
apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims ‘their ancient and un¬
doubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament. These
include freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in civil actions; exemption
from serving on juries, attending as witnesses or serving as sheriffs; and the
right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House.
Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it wishes); the right to
pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat
vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of
its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech; freedom
of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to commit
for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in
the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
36
Committees of
the Privy
Council
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner committee of the
Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the main function of the Privy Council is to advise
the Queen to approve Orders in Council. These are of two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made under prerogative
powers, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorporation;
and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of dele¬
gated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy Council
attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;
this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of the order in
question, whether or not he or she was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parlia¬
ment. The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are indepen¬
dent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision
over the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister to certain eminent persons in indepen¬
dent monarchical countries of the Commonwealth. There are about 360 Privy
Counsellors. A full Privy Council is summoned only on the death of the
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of advisory Privy Council committees whose meetings
differ from those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot
constitutionally be present. These may be prerogative committees, such as
those dealing with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the
Channel Islands and Isle of Man and with applications for charters of in¬
corporation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent mem¬
bers of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue
the appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain
other courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church
sources.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in
the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the Commons. However, the
Government must be fully represented by ministers in the Lords as it requires

spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify its actions to that
House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions, the abolition of an
office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another, or a change in the
designation of a minister may be effected by Order in Council. Ministers may
be classified as follows:
The Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the
Prime Minister during the eighteenth century. The unique position of
authority enjoyed by the holder of this office derives from the ability to
command a majority in Parliament and from the power to submit a personal
choice of ministers to the Queen and to obtain their resignation or dismissal
individually. By modern convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the
House of Commons.
The Prime Minister informs the Queen of the general business of the
Government; presides over the Cabinet; and is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Queen for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as for
appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. They also include advising
the Queen on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lords-Lieutenant and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. Recommendations are
likewise made to the Queen for the award of many civil honours and distinc¬
tions and of Civil List pensions (awarded to people who have achieved emi¬
nence in science and the arts and who are in some financial need). The Prime
Minister also selects the trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
Departmental ministers are in charge of government departments. The hol¬
ders of these offices, who are usually in the Cabinet, are known as ‘Secretary of
State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who, as Second Lord, is the ministerial head of
the Treasury and has overall responsibility for its work).
Non-departmental ministers include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to
time Ministers without Portfolio. These ministers may have few or no depart¬
mental duties and are thus available to perform any special duties which the
Prime Minister may wish to entrust to them. The Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, for example, has ministerial responsibility for the arts, and the
Paymaster General is responsible for co-ordinating the presentation of infor¬
mation about Government policies.

The Cabinet
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State are usually appointed to work with ministers in charge of
government departments. Although the departmental minister is ultimately
responsible for the department, Ministers of State may be responsible to him
or her for specific functions and sometimes their titles reflect these particular
functions. More than one Minister of State may be appointed to a particular
department. It is possible for a Minister of State to be given a seat in the
Cabinet and paid accordingly.
Junior ministers generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or, where
the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under Secretary of
State. They share in parliamentary debates, answering parliamentary ques¬
tions, and assisting in departmental duties. In certain cases, however, they
may be given responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for
specific aspects of the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury and other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different
category as Government Whips (see p. 29).
The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range1 from £12,500 a year
for junior ministers and £16,250 to £i9)3<^<-) for more senior ministers to
£23,500 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor
also receive £23,500. From June 1981 salaries will rise to £14,250 for junior
ministers, to £18,650 to £21,900 for more senior ministers, and to £26,250 for
the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Cabinet ministers.
Ministers in the House of Commons, including the Prime Minister, also
have parliamentary salaries of £6,930 a year (to be increased to £7,670 in 1981)
in recognition of their constituency responsibilities and are entitled to claim the
other allowances paid to all members of the House.
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally chosen by the Prime
Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-departmental
offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences which the
Sovereign held with leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council,
during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an
active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of
organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise
from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to be
submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in
accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination of government departments. The exercise of these functions is
vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a group of party representatives,
depending upon the support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons receives an annual salary for that post
as well as a parliamentary salary; in the House of Lords the Leader of the Opposition receives an
annual salary.

GOVERNMENT
39
Cabinet Meetings The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose informa¬
tion about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of
Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been in
existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office) and a resigning minister wishing to make a statement involving
disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission of the
Queen through the Prime Minister.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less often when Parliament is not sitting.
Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time if a matter
urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the amount of work
coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great deal of work is
carried on through the committee system, which involves the reference of any
issue either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee
composed of the ministers primarily concerned. The committee then considers
the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet
with recommendations for action. The present Cabinet has four standing
committees: a defence and overseas policy committee and an economic
strategy committee both under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister; a
home and social affairs committee under the chairmanship of the Home
Secretary; and a legislation committee under the chairmanship of the Lord
Chancellor. Sub-committees of the standing committees may be established.
Membership and terms of reference of all Cabinet committees is confidential.
Ministers not in the Cabinet may attend its meetings for discussion of
matters affecting their departments; they may also be members of Cabinet
committees. The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet
Office also attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The term ‘ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility
which ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers’
individual responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to act
unanimously even when Cabinet Ministers do not hold identical views on a
given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of departmental ministers
must be consistent with the policy of the Government as a whole. In principle,
once the Government’s policy on a matter has been decided, each minister is
expected to support it, unless he or she chooses to resign. On rare occasions,
ministers have been allowed free votes in Parliament on government policies
involving important issues of principle. The individual responsibility of a
minister for the work of his or her department means that, as political head of
that department, he or she is answerable for all its acts and omissions and must
bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any injustice to an
individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticised in Parliament,
whether personally responsible or not. Since the majority of ministers are
members of the House of Commons, they are available to answer questions and
to defend themselves against criticism in person. Departmental ministers in
the House of Lords are represented in the Commons by someone qualified
to speak on their behalf, usually a Minister of State or a Parliamentary
Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they usually consult their
Ministerial

colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any
decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
keeping government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and
public companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such
a way that there is no conflict between their public duties and their private
interests.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They
may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory
boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under various
degrees of government control.
A change of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by some organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence)
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (like the Depart¬
ment of Employment) cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern
Ireland. Others, such as the Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. There are separate departments for Scot¬
land, Northern Ireland and Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent official,
and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For
instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is responsible
for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, and the
Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury ministers are respon¬
sible for the Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Department for
National Savings and a number of small departments including the Treasury
Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and the National Debt Office.
Generally, departments receive their funds directly out of money provided by
Parliament and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging its
duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: the minister of a major department is
likely to have at the head of his or her officials a permanent secretary, some¬
times assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one or
more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many also have their
own legal advisers or solicitors, economists and statisticians and their own
information divisions. The Government Statistical Service, which includes
the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office (BSO), the
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divisions of the
major departments, provides a service of statistical information and advice.

Departmental

Distribution of
Functions
Each department compiles and publishes statistics relating to its own policy
area. Information about individual industries is published by the BSO in
Business Monitors.
Some departments, such as the Department of Trade and the Central Office
of Information, maintain a regional organisation, and some which have direct
contact with the public throughout the country, for example, the Department
of Employment, also have local offices.
A number of bodies with a role in the process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a department. They are popularly
described as ‘quangos’ (often taken to stand for ‘quasi-autonomous non¬
governmental organisations’, although there is no precise definition of the
term). There are three kinds: executive bodies, advisory bodies and tribunals.
Executive bodies (commonly called fringe bodies because of their functions on
the fringes of central government) generally employ staff and spend money on
their own account; advisory bodies and tribunals do not normally employ staff
or spend money themselves, but their expenses are paid by government
departments concerned. Many of the more important executive bodies are
mentioned in this Handbook; a note on advisory bodies is set out below; and
the position of tribunals is dealt with on p 124.
As a result of a review of non-departmental public bodies undertaken in 1979
by the Government, some 240 are being abolished.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or
committees which undertake research and collect information, mainly to give
ministers access to informed opinion before coming to a decision involving a
legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a statutory obligation on a
minister to consult a standing committee, but usually advisory bodies are
appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned because he or she feels the
need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and represen¬
tatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists, trade
unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and local
government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are committees fre¬
quently set up by the Government to examine and make recommendations on
specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions, whose
members are chosen for their wide experience and diverse knowledge, may be
appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions examine written and oral
evidence from government departments and interested organisations and
individuals, and on this evidence submit recommendations. The Government
may accept the recommendations in whole or in part, or may decide to take no
further action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be undertaken by depart¬
mental committees, appointed by the head of the appropriate department.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which, in
view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further
information on the work of departments is given in later chapters under the
relevant subject headings.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the
direction of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central
Policy Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of
Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at
the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the
progress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff (the ‘Think Tank’) advises ministers
collectively on major issues of policy.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and inter¬
pretation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies and
management. It is directly responsible for the central economic aggregates
such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial statistics and
measures of output and it prepares a wide range of statistical publications. It
co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peacetime events.
The Civil Service Department is responsible for the management of the Civil
Service. The Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service; a senior minister, the Lord President of the
Council, is in charge of the Department on behalf of the Minister for the Civil
Service and is assisted by a Minister of State. The Department’s Permanent
Secretary, its most senior civil servant, is the official head of the Home Civil
Service.
The Department is also responsible for personnel management in the Civil
Service, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment,
training (including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career
management, catering, welfare and retirement. Further responsibilities
include advising the Prime Minister on the allocation of functions and respon¬
sibilities between ministers, making recommendations to the Prime Minister
on senior appointments and advising on public appointments made by
ministers generally. The Department is responsible for the overall efficiency of
the Civil Service, taking the initiative in introducing new management tech¬
niques, scrutinising departments’ methods of operation and controlling Civil
Service manpower and related administrative expenses. In addition, the
Department is responsible for negotiating the pay, pensions and conditions of
service in the Civil Service, and for co-ordinating pay and pensions policies in
the public service as a whole. The Department also seeks to maintain a system
of industrial relations for the Civil Service that promotes the efficient discharge
of public business. The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency
within the Department provides a centre of expertise in the economic purchase
and effective use of computers in government.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for recruitment to the
Civil Service, is linked to the Civil Service Department. In matters concerned
with recruitment policy, the commissioners are responsible to ministers in the
normal way, but in the selection of individuals for appointment they act under
Order in Council and are completely independent.

The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills related exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The Office
advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends
sittings (and committees) of both Houses as required. In addition the
Parliamentary Counsel draft subordinate legislation when specially instructed,
and advise the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitutional ques¬
tions falling within their special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Financial
Secretary and two Ministers of State. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Its Public Services Sector
is responsible for controlling aggregate public expenditure and for most of the
individual public expenditure programmes; the Domestic Economy Sector is
concerned with fiscal and monetary policies, and with the Treasury’s contribu¬
tion to industrial policies, including control of public expenditure on industry
and agriculture; the Overseas Finance Sector is responsible for balance of
payments policies, the management of Britain’s foreign currency reserves,
international monetary questions, financial relations with other countries and
the aid programme; and the Chief Economic Adviser’s Sector is responsible for
the preparation of short-term and medium-term economic forecasts and for
specialist advice on broad economic policies.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which is directed by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (assisted by two Ministers of State
and a Parliamentary Secretary), is responsible for administering government
policy for agriculture, horticulture and fishing in England and for many food
matters in the United Kingdom. Some of the Ministry’s responsibilities for
animal health extend to Great Britain. In association with the other agricul¬
tural departments in the United Kingdom and the Intervention Board for
Agricultural Produce, it is responsible for the administration of the European
Community common agricultural and fisheries policies and for various
national support schemes. It administers schemes for the control and eradica¬
tion of animal and plant diseases and for assistance to capital investment in
farm and horticultural businesses and land drainage; it exercises respon¬
sibilities relating to research and development. The Ministry sponsors the food
and drink manufacturing industries and the food and drink distributive trades.
It is concerned with the supply and quality of food, food compositional
standards, food hygiene and the labelling and advertising of food, and it has
certain responsibilities for ensuring that public health standards are met in the
manufacture, preparation and distribution of basic foods.
An executive department under the direction and control of ministers respon¬
sible for agriculture, the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce is
responsible for implementing within the United Kingdom the market support
arrangements and certain other aspects of the European Community’s Com¬
mon Agricultural Policy provided for under the guarantee section of the

European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. In consultation with
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Overseas Development Administra¬
tion, the Board is responsible for organising the supply of cereals for develop¬
ing countries under the Food Aid Convention 1971, and for administering
occasional Community donations of other commodities to developing
countries and areas of national disasters.
The Office of Arts and Libraries is the responsibility of the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster and deals with policy and financial support for the arts and
for libraries and museums. Government support for activities in these areas is
given mainly through independent bodies, for example, the Arts Council and
the British Film Institute (see chapter 21, Promotion of the Arts). They also
include the British Library, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and the
British Museum and other national museums and galleries. The governing
bodies of these institutions are appointed mainly by the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and are responsible for making the
necessary artistic and professional judgments and for allocating funds for
particular purposes.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties, including value added tax, imposed
from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to
advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them.
The Board is also responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the
revenue laws.
The Board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the import and export of certain classes of goods, and the compilation of
United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs import and export
documents. Parliamentary responsibility for the Board’s work is exercised by
Treasury ministers.
The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for
defence policy and for the control and administration of the three armed
services—Navy, Army and Air Force (including the procurement of defence
equipment). The Secretary of State for Defence, assisted by a Minister of
State, is in charge of the Department. Three Parliamentary Under Secretaries
of State are responsible for the three armed services.
The Department of Education and Science is responsible for the general
promotion of education in England; for the Government’s relations with
universities in Great Britain; and for fostering civil science both in Britain and
internationally. The Department is directed by a Secretary of State, who is
assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State. Matters relating to the development of school and post-school education
for which the Department has responsibility include the broad allocation of
resources for education, the capital programmes for building new schools and
other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of teachers, and the
basic standards of education. The Department co-operates with the local
education authorities which provide and run the schools and colleges in their
areas. Its relations with the universities are conducted through the University
Grants Committee. Responsibilities for civil science are discharged mainly
through five research councils: the Agricultural Research Council, the Medi-

cal Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Science
Research Council, and the Social Science Research Council. On questions of
scientific policy an advisory board for the research councils advises the Secre¬
tary of State.
An important part of the Department is Her Majesty’s Inspectorate which is
responsible for inspecting and reporting on educational establishments and
reporting to and advising the Secretary of State and the Department on the
performance of the education service. Inspectors’ duties are not confined to
schools: they cover the whole range of education except the universities and
private establishments and further education.
The Department of Employment has responsibility for manpower policies in
Great Britain, either directly or through statutory agencies, and for the formu¬
lation of labour legislation. It is also responsible for monitoring labour market
trends, including pay, and for producing statistics on them and on retail prices
(from which the rate of inflation is calculated). The Department is responsible
for the payment of unemployment benefit through its local offices; for the issue
of work permits to workers from overseas; and for the Race Relations
Employment Advisory Service. The Secretary of State for Employment is
assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State.
The Department of Energy is concerned with the development of government
policies for the supply and use of all forms of energy. It discharges functions
connected with the nationalised coal and gas industries in Great Britain and the
electricity industry in England and Wales; is responsible for the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority; and is the sponsoring department for the
nuclear power and oil industries including the British National Oil Corpora¬
tion. It is also responsible for the development policy for offshore oil and gas
resources in the British sector of the continental shelf; and it sponsors, through
the Offshore Supplies Office in Glasgow, the suppliers of equipment to the
offshore operators. The Department also represents Britain in international
discussions on energy policy, including relations and co-operation with oil-
producing countries. It is the sponsoring and co-ordinating body for energy
conservation policy, and also operates financial assistance schemes for energy
surveys and technological demonstration projects. The Department encour¬
ages the development of new sources of energy, with assistance from the
Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire. The Secretary of
State for Energy is assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under
Secretaries of State.
The Department of the Environment is responsible in England for a wide
range of functions relating to the physical environment in which people live
and work. The Department is responsible for urban affairs and inner city
renewal; new towns; local government; regional affairs; the finance and policy
of the housing programme; the construction industries; planning, develop¬
ment control and land; special responsibilities for sport and recreation; the
control of pollution; water and sewerage; minerals; countryside affairs; and
the Property Services Agency (which provides nearly all government common
services relating to land, property, building and furnishings).
The Department is also concerned with the conservation of historic towns,
buildings and ancient monuments, and research into planning matters, build¬
ing and construction, environmental pollution and resources.

State (one for Housing and Construction and the other for Local Government
and Environmental Affairs) and four Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State, one of whom has special responsibility for sport and recreation.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, which is a separate government
department within the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Trade, offers
two main facilities to British exporters. It insures exporters against the risk of
not being paid for goods and services (whether through the default or insol¬
vency of the buyer or through other causes such as exchange difficulties in the
buyer’s country), and provides access to bank finance for exports, often at
favourable rates of interest. In addition the Department provides support for
‘buyer credits’ (loans made direct to overseas buyers for capital goods contracts
enabling the supplier to be paid on cash terms); insurance against the political
risks of new overseas investment for up to 15 years; partial protection for large
capital goods contracts against an unexpectedly high rise in costs; and support
for the issue of performance bonds.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides, mainly through diplomatic
missions, the means of communication between the British Government and
other governments and international governmental organisations for the dis¬
cussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling
within the field of international relations. In particular the Department is
responsible for alerting the British Government to the implications of
developments overseas; for protecting British interests overseas, including
commercial interests; for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining
British policies to, and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with,
governments and peoples overseas. The Department is also responsible for the
discharge of British responsibilities in the Associated States (mainly for
defence and external affairs) and dependent territories. In the dependent
territories, each of which has its own internal administration, the British
Government is finally responsible for good government and for the relations
between these territories and other countries.
The Department is headed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, who is assisted by the Lord Privy Seal and four
Ministers of State (one of whom has responsibility for overseas develop¬
ment—see below) and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
Overseas development matters are the responsibility of the Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The Overseas Development
Administration is responsible for Britain’s policy of financial aid and technical
co-operation in developing countries. It is concerned with the aid programme
as a whole and with its detailed composition. The provision of financial aid
includes both grants and loans (the latter on concessional terms) and support
for multilateral aid agencies, such as the IBRD (World Bank); technical
co-operation comprises the supply of British experts and equipment, training
of overseas personnel, and support of research and advisory services.
The Department of Health and Social Security, headed by the Secretary of
State for Social Services, is responsible in England for the administration of
the National Health Service; for the social services provided by local
authorities for the elderly and handicapped, socially deprived families, and
children in care; and for certain aspects of public health, including hygiene.
Throughout Great Britain it is responsible for the collection of social security

contributions and the payment of benefits. The Department is concerned in
making reciprocal health and social security arrangements with other countries
and in administering European Community social security regulations for
immigrant workers. It also represents the United Kingdom in the World
Health Organisation.
The Department is also responsible for paying supplementary benefits and
family income supplement, for resettlement centres, and for assessing the
means of people applying for legal aid. The Department also has responsibility
for pensions and welfare services (including in some cases the provision of
medical and surgical treatment) for war pensioners in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and, through its various agencies, for
United Kingdom war pensioners living in other countries. Within the
Department, the Social Security Advisory Committee, which replaced the
National Insurance Advisory Committee and the Supplementary Benefit
Commissions of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1980, provides advice
and assistance for the Secretary of State on the major part of the social security
system, while the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, the Attendance
Allowance Board and the Occupational Pensions Board advise on their highly
specialised, often technical areas.
The Secretary of State for Social Services is assisted by two Ministers of
State (the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security, who also
has special responsibility for the disabled) and two Parliamentary Under
Secretaries of State.
The Home Office deals with those internal affairs in England and Wales not
assigned to other government departments. The Secretary of State is the
means of communication between the Crown and the public, and between the
United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man. The minister exercises certain prerogative powers of the
Crown, of which the most important are the prerogative of mercy and the
maintenance of the Queen’s Peace. The Home Office is also concerned with:
the administration of justice; criminal law; the treatment of offenders, includ¬
ing probation and the prison service; certain public safety matters; the police,
fire and emergency services; immigration and nationality; community rela¬
tions; co-ordination of government action in relation to voluntary social ser¬
vices. Race relations and sex discrimination policy and broad questions of
national broadcasting policy are also Home Office matters.
Other responsibilities include: addresses and petitions to the Queen, prep¬
aration of patents of nobility for peers, and formal proceedings for the granting
of honours; requests for the extradition of criminals; scrutiny of local authority
by-laws; granting of licences for scientific experiments on animals; exhuma¬
tion and removal of bodies; firearms; dangerous drugs; general policy on laws
relating to liquor licensing; gaming and lotteries; charitable collections; and
theatre and cinema licensing. The Secretary of State is assisted by two
Ministers of State and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
The Department of Industry, under a Secretary of State, is responsible for
policy in relation to industry including policy towards small firms. It is
responsible for regional industrial policy and for financial assistance to indus¬
try other than through the tax system, though some of its functions in these
areas relate only to England. The Department sponsors the general manufac¬
turing industries as well as British Aerospace, British Shipbuilders, the British
Steel Corporation, the Post Office, Cable and Wireless Ltd and the National
4^ BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Enterprise Board. It is responsible for the operation of the Government’s
research establishments, and for the Business Statistics Office.
The Department’s regional offices also serve the Departments of Trade and
Energy.
The Secretary of State is assisted by two Ministers of State and two
Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Central
Office of
Information
The Central Office of Information (COI), a common service department,
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments (which are responsible for the
policies expressed). In the United Kingdom it conducts press, television, radio
and poster advertising; produces booklets, leaflets, films, radio and television
material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material; and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and
television material, publications and reference services (including this official
handbook), films, exhibitions, photographs, and display and reading-room
material. The COI provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultural
exhibitions); and organises visits (other than those sponsored by the British
Council and the British Overseas Trade Board) for people officially invited to
Britain. It also provides services for London-based correspondents of the
overseas news media and training facilities for information officers of overseas
governments. There are nine regional information offices in England provid¬
ing services for the home departments and assisting the overseas services
by supplying reports on developments within their regions and by arranging
visits for overseas visitors; similar services are provided on a mutually agreed
basis by the information staffs of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
Offices.
The Board of
Inland
Revenue
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital transfer tax, petroleum
revenue tax, development land tax and certain other direct taxes, and advises
the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. It is also
responsible for the valuation of land and buildings for such purposes as
compensation for compulsory purchase and, in England and Wales, local rates
(a form of local property taxation).
The Law
Officers’
Department
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General) appear on behalf of the Crown in important civil and
criminal proceedings and before international tribunals such as the Interna¬
tional Court of Justice at The Hague and the European Commission and Court
of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The Attorney General is the senior legal
adviser to the Government and has the ultimate responsibility for the enforce¬
ment of the criminal law; his consent is necessary before proceedings for a
number of criminal offences can be undertaken and he superintends the work
of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Legal proceedings for the enforcement
of public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted in the
name of the Attorney General, who also directs the work of the Queen’s
Proctor, an officer with duties connected with the operation of the divorce
laws.
The Attorney General is also spokesman for the Lord Chancellor in the
House of Commons on matters affecting the administration of justice. The
Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney General, with the

same rights and duties. The Law Officers, who are leading barristers, are
always members of the House of Commons.
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the judiciary or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian of
the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor may sit judicially as a member of the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council.
The Lord Chancellor is also the minister primarily responsible for the
administration of the courts and of the law. The Home Secretary has important
responsibilities for the criminal law but the Lord Chancellor appoints magis¬
trates and recommends to the Crown most other appointments to the judiciary
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Responsibility for the courts and for
their administrative staff is exercised through six regional (or circuit) offices
and their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court procedure and for law reform,
including appointing the members of the Law Commission, and presenting the
Commission’s reports to Parliament.
The Lord Chancellor appoints the chairmen of certain administrative tri¬
bunals in England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for Scotland)
the members of the Council on Tribunals: he is also responsible for the
administration of the Judge Advocate General’s Department,1 the Department
of the Official Solicitor2 and the Public Record Office (which preserves, and
provides access to, the national archives).
The Ordnance Survey is responsible for the surveying and mapping of Great
Britain (Northern Ireland has its own Ordnance Survey). This includes
geodetic surveys and associated scientific work, topographic surveys and the
production of maps at appropriate scales from these surveys. The Department
also undertakes a considerable amount of agency work for other departments,
particularly the Ministry of Defence, for the Institute of Geological Sciences
and for the Land Registry. Parliamentary responsibility for the Ordnance
Survey is exercised by ministers of the Department of the Environment.
The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament is
transferred (in whatever sums may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office. The Department is also
responsible for the regular payment of many public service pensions.
1 The Judge Advocate General’s Department advises the Secretary of State for Defence and the
Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military law, and reviews the
proceedings of army and air force courts martial.
2 The Official Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a mental
disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not be represented. In
addition the Official Solicitor protects the interests of people committed to prison for contempt of
court, acts as Receiver for people with a mental disability and as Judicial Trustee in complex and
disputed trusts.

The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) is the office of the
Registrar General for England and Wales. It is responsible for administering
the Marriage Acts and local registration of births, marriages and deaths;
estimating and projecting national, regional and local populations and the
movement of people within Britain and between Britain and overseas; compil¬
ing statistics of diseases, injuries and deaths, and other aspects of health service
information; taking the Census of Population and processing, analysing and
reporting the resulting statistics; and conducting surveys on a wide range of
subjects for other government departments.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of the Department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The Department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers the estates of people dying intestate and without known relatives
and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dissolved companies.
The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled by the Treasury
Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute Law Committee (a
body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the judiciary and legal
profession in Great Britain).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based on
or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer with certain
duties relating to the divorce laws).
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the publisher for Parliament and
the Government. The Controller is the Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament
and is responsible for the copyright of all British government documents.
Official publications are sold by government bookshops in London, Edin-
burgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham, and through
agents and booksellers overseas. HMSO is the United Kingdom agent for
publications of the European Community and other principal international
organisations.
HMSO provides a wide range of procurement services for Parliament and
the Government in the areas of printing and office supplies. It also operates its
own printing presses and binderies, the latter concentrating on conservation
work for the national archives.
The Department is managed as a commercial body on the basis of its
relationships with its customers and its borrowing from the National Loans
Fund.
The Department of Trade is responsible, under a Secretary of State, for
commercial policy and relations with overseas countries. It promotes British
commercial interests overseas, negotiates trade and commercial matters, and
administers British protective tariffs. It sponsors the work of the British
Overseas Trade Board in export services and government support for overseas
trade fairs and provides an information service to industry largely through its

and travel industries, the newspaper, printing, publishing and film industries,
and the distributive and service trades. The Secretary of State is assisted by
two Ministers of State (one of whom is Minister for Consumer Affairs) and two
Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Department of Transport, headed by a Minister who is assisted by a
Parliamentary Secretary, is responsible in England for the main transport
industries, including railways, buses, freight and ports. It is also responsible
for the planning and construction of motorways and trunk roads, although
decisions arising from independent inspectors’ reports on public inquiries into
roads are shared with the Department of the Environment. Further respon¬
sibilities include local transport, road and vehicle safety, and vehicle and driver
licensing.
The Secretary of State for Wales, a Cabinet minister, has full responsibility in
Wales for ministerial functions relating to health and personal social services,
housing, local government, education (except universities), town and country
planning, new towns, water and sewerage, roads, agriculture, forestry, tour¬

Secretary of State has certain responsibilities relating to the National Library
and the National Museum; the Wales Tourist Board and the Sports Council
for Wales, and shared responsibility for the administration of urban grants to
areas of acute social deprivation. The Secretary of State, who is assisted by two
Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State, has direct ministerial responsibility
in Wales for selective financial assistance to industry, as well as a general
responsibility for economic development. The Welsh Development Agency
and the Development Board for Rural Wales, which are responsible to the
Secretary of State, also have important industrial, environmental and (in the
case of the Board) social functions.
The Welsh Office maintains close and continuous contacts with the govern¬
ment departments mainly concerned with economic and industrial affairs. The
main Welsh Office is in Cardiff, with branches throughout Wales and a small
ministerial office in London.
Scotland has its own system of law and a wide measure of administrative
autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for formulating and
carrying out policy relating to agriculture and fisheries, education, law and
order, local government and environmental services, social work, health,
housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road transport services.
The Secretary of State also has a major and expanding role in the planning
and development of the Scottish economy, and important functions related to
industrial development, with responsibility for selective financial assistance to
industry, for the Scottish Development Agency, and for the work of the
Manpower Services Commission and the careers service. Moreover, the Secre¬

The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers: the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters,
the distinctively Scottish features and the different conditions and needs of the
country and its people are reflected in separate legislation relating wholly to
Scotland, or else in sections of special application to Scotland only inserted in
Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally. The Secretary
of State is also responsible for a range of other functions from fire services to
sport and tourism. A Minister of State and three Parliamentary Under Sec¬
retaries of State assist the Secretary of State.
The United Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
supported by Central Services, based in Edinburgh (although with some staff
dispersed over Scotland), known collectively as the Scottish Office. The
Scottish Office Management Group, under the chairmanship of the Perma¬
nent Under-Secretary of State, with a membership consisting of the head of
each of the departments and the Deputy Secretary, Central Services, advises
the Secretary of State, particularly on questions such as the allocation of
resources and forward planning, with which more than one of the departments
are concerned.
United Kingdom government departments with significant Scottish
responsibilities have offices in Scotland with delegated powers and work
closely with the Scottish Office.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland is responsible for
promoting the agriculture and fishing industries in Scotland. For agriculture
this includes taking part in European Community negotiations on agricultural
policy, providing technical and financial help to farmers, supervising educa¬
tional, advisory and research services, administering a variety of schemes for
the improvement of land, farm stock and crops, developing crofting and
managing a large area of agricultural land which is in public ownership. Its
duties for fisheries include participating in international arrangements for
conservation and other aspects of fishing and in the European Community
negotiations on fisheries policy, providing financial support for the fishing
industry, assistance for fishery harbours, scientific research and the protection
of Scottish fisheries by the Department’s fleet of fishery protection vessels.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of key
services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and
country planning, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage, coast protec¬
tion, flood prevention, building standards and the prevention of river and air
pollution (most of which are administered by local authorities). The Depart¬
ment is also responsible for general policy relating to local government organ¬
isation and for ancient monuments and historic buildings; certain transport
functions including oversight of the Scottish Transport Group; and assistance
for shipping services, ferry services, pier work, and air services in the High¬
lands and Islands.

the administration of penal institutions. It is also responsible for administering
the National Health Service in Scotland, for legislation relating to public
service superannuation schemes in Scotland and for administering the
teachers’ and National Health Service superannuation schemes. The Home
and Health Department is the central authority in Scotland for the fire service,
for certain home defence and emergency services, and for legislation concern¬
ing shops, theatres, cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure matters.
Central Services provides a series of services to the other five departments.
They include the Finance Divisions which, in addition to providing a common
finance service, are responsible for developing and administering local
government finance policy. They also include the Office of the Solicitor to the
Secretary of State; the Inquiry Reporters Unit; Liaison Division in London;
the Scottish Information Office; the Central Statistical Unit; and the Estab¬
lishment and related divisions which provide supporting services such as
personnel management, manpower control, computer telecommunications,
library and office services.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. These include the Department of the Registrar-General for
Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office; and the
Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish branches of
the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the direction of
controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the policy and procedure of
their departments are carried out in Scotland in accordance with Scottish
conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for
litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned with
questions of legal policy and administration and is responsible for instituting
and directing all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland, and for controlling

Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department and the Scottish
Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s Department
also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain government depart¬
ments which have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work relating to
prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts and
court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions in
the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
proposals for law reform and questions involving private international law,
internal conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and procedure
of the Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
The Government of Ireland Act 1920 enacted a constitution which, while
preserving the supreme authority of the United Kingdom Parliament and
reserving certain matters to that Parliament, provided Northern Ireland with
its own legislature and executive to deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters.
This structure remained in force until 1972 when, following several years of
sectarian violence and terrorism in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Government resigned and a period of direct rule was introduced, with execu¬
tive powers under the control of a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In
1973 a new constitution for the Province provided, among other things, for the
devolution of powers to a legislative assembly and a ‘power-sharing’ executive
with responsibility for the devolved services (such as agriculture, commerce,
education, health and the environment). Responsibility for law and order,
electoral matters and business of national importance such as foreign policy,
defence and most aspects of taxation remained with the United Kingdom
Government and Parliament. These arrangements came into force in January
1974, but following widespread opposition in Northern Ireland the Executive
resigned and the Assembly was prorogued in May 1974. In July 1974 the
Northern Ireland Act was passed, providing for the election of a Constitutional
Convention to consider what arrangements for the government of Northern
Ireland would be likely to command most widespread acceptance throughout
the community. The Act provided for an interim period (defined as one year
from the passing of the Act) during which the United Kingdom Government,
through the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, should continue to be
responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament for the devolved services.
The Northern Ireland Assembly was finally dissolved at the end of March
1975, and elections to the Constitutional Convention and its first meeting took
place in May of that year. In March 1976, the Convention was dissolved,
having failed to reach agreement on the central issue of a system of government
which would attract the widespread acceptance of the community. Direct rule
as provided for in the Northern Ireland Act has since been extended for further
periods of a year and Northern Ireland departments continue to discharge their
functions under the direction and control of the Secretary of State for North¬
ern Ireland. The Government’s aim is to restore peace and security to the
Province and to promote social and economic welfare. It is also seeking an

acceptable way of restoring to the people of Northern Ireland more control
over their own affairs and has published proposals for the future government of
the Province (see Bibliography). These envisage a substantial transfer of
power to a new Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and set out two
broad options for participation by representatives of the minority community.
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and three
Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is
answerable to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. Through
this Office the Secretary of State has responsibility for constitutional develop¬
ments, law and order and security, and electoral matters.
The Northern Ireland departments are subject to the direction and control of
the Secretary of State. Their principal functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of North¬
ern Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Its functions also
include the collection of agricultural census data, the compilation of statistics,
the provision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and the promotion of
agricultural research, education and training. The Department acts as agent
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in agricultural support and
the implementation of the European Community’s Common Agricultural
Policy.
The Department of the Civil Service is responsible for the general manage¬
ment and control of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of North¬
ern Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes
of assistance to industry including liaison with the Local Enterprise Develop¬
ment Unit and Northern Ireland Development Agency; trade promotion
including supplies to the offshore oil industry sector; energy supply and
conservation; development of tourism; harbours (other than fishery har¬
bours); safety in mines and quarries; mineral development; consumer protec¬
tion (including weights and measures); registration of companies; societies,
credit unions and trade unions; control of insurance companies and unit trusts;
industrial science and technology promotion.
The Department of Education is responsible for central policy, co-ordination,
legislation and financial control of the education and library service. It is
concerned not only with education and learning but with recreation, culture,
and entertainment. The Department is responsible for the development of
primary, secondary and further education, including higher education, com¬
munity and adult education, special education, oversight of the five area
education and library boards, teacher training, teachers’ salaries and superan¬
nuation, examinations, the arts and libraries, youth services, sport and recrea¬
tion and community services and facilities.
The Department of the Environment has direct responsibility for the construc¬
tion and maintenance of all roads, the provision of water supplies and sewerage
services and for planning and planning compensation. In addition it exercises
certain controls over housing and local government and has responsibility for

public health, public transport, road traffic management, motor taxation,
historic monuments and buildings.
The Department of Finance’s responsibilities include the control of the expen¬
diture of the Northern Ireland departments, liaison with the United Kingdom
Treasury and the Northern Ireland Office on financial matters, and economic
and social research and statistics.
The Department also has responsibility for: rating policy and the collection
of rates; borrowing; loan advances; charities; the provision and maintenance
of public buildings; building regulations and liaison with the construction
industry; Ordnance Survey; valuation; Public Record Office; the registration
of births, marriages and deaths; Registry of Deeds; the registration of title
of land; miscellaneous licensing; the registration of clubs; and Ulster
Savings.
The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for social security
and, through four Health and Social Services Boards and the Central Services
Agency, for personal and public health services and for personal social services
(including child care and adoption).
The Department of Manpower Services has responsibility for the administra¬
tion of government policy in relation to the employment and training of labour.
It operates Jobmarkets, employment service and careers offices; administers a
comprehensive training programme; operates grant schemes to encourage
training and employment; compiles statistics on employment and unemploy¬
ment and undertakes research into employment matters. It provides a factory
inspectorate and deals with industrial relations and the rehabilitation and
employment of the disabled.
It is also responsible for sponsorship of the direct labour organisation of
Enterprise Ulster and has functions in relation to the Industry Training
Boards, Northern Ireland Training Executive, Fair Employment Agency, the
Equal Opportunities Commission, the Labour Relations Agency and the
Health and Safety Agency.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
The Civil Service is concerned with the conduct of the whole range of govern¬
ment activities as they affect the community. Civil servants’ work extends from
the formulation of policy proposals for ministers to the management of the
machinery of Government and the carrying out of the day-to-day duties that
public administration demands.
Civil Servants are servants of the Crown. They are responsible to the
minister in whose department they work for the execution of the minister’s
policies. Ministers alone are answerable to Parliament for their policies and the
actions of their staff. A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes
within the administration or to the advent of a Government of a different
political complexion, does not involve a change of staff. (Ministers sometimes
appoint special policy advisers from outside the Civil Service; the advisers are
paid from public funds, but their appointments come to an end when the
Government term of office finishes.) Selection to the Service is by open
competition supervised by a formally independent body; the system of pro¬
motion within the Service is by merit.
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equi-

valent to one full-time), there are about 700,200 civil servants (over 40 per
cent of them women), roughly 320,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of
public services, such as paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes
and contributions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and provid¬
ing services to industry and agriculture. About 240,000 are employed in
the Ministry of Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal
Dockyards. The rest are about equally divided between: central administrat¬
ive and policy duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation,
printing and information; and largely financially self-supporting services,
for instance those provided by the Department for National Savings and the
Royal Mint.
Three-quarters of civil servants work outside London. As part of its policy of
reducing the claims of the public sector on the country’s resources the
Government is making significant cuts in Civil Service manpower. Between
May 1979 and July 1980 numbers were reduced from 732,000 to 700,200; a
further reduction to 630,000 by 1984 is planned.
The total number includes about 157,000 ‘industrial’ civil servants, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and
conditions of service are on the whole separately administered from those of
‘non-industrial’ civil servants.
The structure of the Home Civil Service is designed to allow for a flexible
deployment of staff so that talent can be used to the best advantage, with higher
posts open to people of outstanding ability, whatever their specialist back¬
ground or original method of entry into the Service. Although work requiring
specialist skill is always done by appropriately qualified individuals, personnel
management policies are designed to ensure that people with the necessary
qualities gain suitable wide experience to fit them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is an open and unified
structure, comprising three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary
and under secretary. With very few exceptions, staff at this level share the same
pay and grading system whatever their background and duties.
At other levels the structure is based on a system of occupational groups,
which are the basic groupings of staff for the purposes of pay, recruitment and
personnel management, and categories which consist of one or more occu¬
pational groups having a common pay and grading pattern.
Categories include the General Category (covering the Administration,
Economist, Statistician, Information Officer and Librarian groups), the
Science Category, the Professional and Technology Category (including
architects, surveyors, electrical and mechanical engineers, graphics officers
and marine services staff), and the Training, Legal, Police, Secretarial, Data
Processing, Research Officer, Social Security, Physical Security and Museum
Categories. Together these 12 categories account for some 75 per cent of
non-industrial staff.
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of the Crown, provides the staff for
service in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Com¬
monwealth countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating
with overseas governments and conducting business in international organisa¬
tions; promoting British exports and trade generally, administering aid,
presenting ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries;

and protecting British interests abroad. Nearly a third are employed on export
promotion, a quarter on consular work, and the remainder are divided between
political, economic, information and cultural work.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service, and conditions of work are in many ways compar¬
able while taking into account the special demands of the Service, particularly
of postings overseas. The Service also has secretarial, communications and
security officer branches. Members of the Home Civil Service and the armed
forces, and individuals from the private sector, may serve in the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and at overseas posts on loan or attachment. A closer
working relationship between the Diplomatic Service and the Home Civil
Service is planned.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional
differences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being
effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for
departmental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, the Overseas Development Administration and the Crown Agents for
Oversea Governments and Administrations are generally asked to recruit other
candidates, principally from the United Kingdom. Hong Kong has its own
Government office in London with responsibility for recruiting to the Hong
Kong public service.
Recruitment to the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service is the
responsibility of the Civil Service Commission which, in conjunction with
departments, ensures that staff are selected solely on merit through fair and
open competition. The selection of junior staff such as those engaged in clerical
and manual work, is undertaken almost entirely by departments. The Com¬
mission, however, is responsible for issuing the ‘certificate of qualification’
necessary for permanent appointment. The appointment of a successful can-
didjfte is made by the department concerned.
For the Administration Group, the central part of the Home Civil Service,
entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achievements of: an
honours degree; GCE Advanced level; and GCE Ordinary level. The selection
procedure for the highest of these levels (the Administration Trainee entry)
comprises qualifying tests, followed by tests and interviews at the Civil Service
Selection Board and an interview by the Final Selection Board. For the next
level (the Executive Officer entry) selection involves qualifying tests for those
possessing the necessary academic qualifications, followed by an interview.
For the lower level (the clerical entry) selection is normally by interview of
those holding the prescribed educational qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments there are full-time
training officers and tutors whose task is to help identify the training needs of
the staff and to organise training by the most appropriate methods (for
example, formal courses or self-instruction) to provide for their varying
requirements. The Civil Service College provides that training which is most

efficiently undertaken centrally, and considerable use is made of external
institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may continue their education by attend¬
ing appropriate courses usually for one day a week (‘day release’ schemes).
Adult staff are assisted financially to undertake, mainly in their own time,
private studies leading to recognised educational or professional qualifications
in approved subjects. There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid¬
career to obtain fellowships or to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in
areas of interest to themselves and their departments.
All new entrants undergo a period of probation (varying according to grade,
with extensions in certain instances). Promotions are made partly through
centrally conducted competitions and partly by the departments themselves.
Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but arrangements exist for accel¬
erated promotion for staff who show exceptional promise. Promotions or
appointments to deputy secretary-level posts and above and all transfers
between departments at these levels are approved by the Prime Minister,
advised by the official head of the Home Civil Service.
Civil Servants are encouraged to join the trade union which represents the
grade to which they belong. The National Whitley Council, consisting of
senior officials (called the Official Side) and representatives of the unions
(known as the Trade Union Side) exists to discuss all matters affecting
conditions of service of staff and to provide a forum for consultation. Whitley
committees exist in all government departments. Pay negotiations are con¬
ducted directly with the individual unions or with the Trade Union Side
representing all the unions.
Civil servants are required to serve loyally the Government of the day, regard¬
less of its political composition. In order therefore to maintain civil servants’
reputation for political impartiality, some restrictions are placed on freedom to
participate in political activities. No civil servant may be a member of Parlia¬
ment, or (with certain exceptions corresponding to the ‘politically free’ group
shown below) be adopted as parliamentary candidate.
Civil Service rules place staff in one of three groups for the purpose of
political activities: (i) the ‘politically free’ group, consisting of industrial and
non-office grades, who are free to engage in any political activity including
standing for Parliament (although they would have to resign from the Service if
elected); (2) the ‘politically restricted’ group, consisting of all staff above
Executive Officer level, together with those Executive Officers and certain
related grades such as Information Officers, who are debarred from national
political activities but may apply for permission to take part in local political
activities; and (3) the ‘intermediate’ group, comprising all other staff—mainly
clerical and typing grades—who may apply for permission to take part in
national or local political activity apart from adoption as a parliamentary
candidate.
Where required, permission is granted to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the
avoidance of any conflict with official duties. It is granted subject to a code of
discretion requiring moderation and the avoidance of embarrassment to
ministers. An independent committee of inquiry, set up by the Government to
review the Civil Service rules governing political activities, has reported in
favour of retaining the general framework of these rules in order to maintain
the principle of Civil Service political impartiality, and has recommended
6o
Security
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
some changes which would transfer a substantial number of staff from the
‘restricted’ to the ‘intermediate’ group, establish standard criteria against
which applications for permission could be judged, and provide an appeal body
for staff who are refused permission. These recommendations are the subject
of consultations.
All civil servants have the right to register their private political opinions by
voting, for instance, at general or local authority elections. They may also
engage in any private activities they wish, provided there is no conflict with
official duties, nor with the provisions of the official secrets or prevention of
corruption legislation. However, since civil servants must not use their official
position to further private interests, they are subject to certain restrictions in
commerce and business: for instance they may not hold private interests in
public contracts nor use official information in writing, broadcasting or lectur¬
ing without the approval of their department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern. However, no one whose loyalty is in doubt may be employed on work
the nature of which is vital to the security of the State. For this reason certain
posts are not open to anyone who is known to be a member of a Communist or
Fascist organisation, or associated with such an organisation in a way that
raises legitimate doubts about his or her reliability, or to anyone whose
reliability may be in doubt for any other reason.
Each department is responsible for its own internal security, advised as
necessary by the Security Service. The Security Commission, if requested
to do so by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition, may investigate any report on breaches of security in the
public service and advise whether any change in security procedure is necess¬
ary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
A wide range of public services is provided by local authorities throughout the
United Kingdom, democratically elected in the areas for which they are
responsible. The gradual expansion of local authority services, particularly in
the period between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, has inevitably led to a steady
rise in local government expenditure and in its support from central funds. In
recent years central government has sought to check this growth as part of a
general policy of reducing public expenditure, and at local level sections of the
electorate have protested at having to meet the considerable annual increases in
‘rates’ (local property taxes—see p 66). Since taking office, the Government
has emphasised the need to achieve substantial reductions in public expendi¬
ture in order to redress the balance between the public and private sectors of
the national economy and has asked local authorities to reduce their expendi¬
ture in line with reductions being made in its own spending. Local authorities
have also been asked to follow the example of central government and to
reappraise urgently their staff recruitment and manpower requirements.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament, or by measures made under the authority of an Act. The
actual administration, and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are
the responsibility of the local authority. In the case of certain services, how¬
ever, government ministers have powers, defined in the relevant Acts, to
secure a measure of national uniformity in the standard of a service provided,
to safeguard public health, or to protect the rights of individual citizens. For

some services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for
others there are strictly limited powers.
Legislation before Parliament would introduce important changes in the
relationship between central and local government. It includes proposals for
removing a substantial number of central government controls over local
government; for increasing the accountability of local authorities; for intro¬
ducing in England and Wales a new system of financing local government; and
for controlling local authorities’ capital expenditure.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are: in
England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern
Ireland, the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county
authorities, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale local
government services, while the districts are responsible for the more local ones
(see pp 63-4). However, in six of the English counties, which are heavily
populated and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility for some
large-scale services rests with the district authorities. In England populations
in the non-metropolitan counties range from 289,800 to about 1-5 million (the
Isle of Wight with a population of about 115,000 is an exception), and in the
metropolitan counties from 1-3 to 2-7 million. District authorities within
metropolitan counties have populations of between 162,600 and 1 million:
other districts have average populations of between 75,000 and 100,000
although many fall outside this range. The local government system in Wales
closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England. Populations in
the counties range from 106,000 to 537,900 and the districts have populations
of between 20,700 and 278,400. English parish councils or meetings serve as
focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited powers of local interest. In
Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 1,580 sq km (610 sq
miles) and a population of some 7 million—is administered by the Greater
London Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations
ranging from 135,700 to 320,500) and the Corporation of the City of London
(the historic centre with a resident population of 5,500).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is made for local community councils to be formed.
These councils have no statutory functions and are not local authorities.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland there are 26 district councils which are responsible for
local environmental and certain other services. Statutory bodies and local
offices, responsible to central departments, administer major services such as
roads, water, education, health, and housing. Populations of the districts range
from 13,000 to over 350,000.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. They can claim a flat-rate attendance allowance
6z
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for performing council business; they are also entitled to travelling and subsis¬
tence allowances. Parish and community councillors cannot claim expenses for
duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority (except in Northern Ireland
where they are granted by the Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the
chairman is normally known as the Mayor (in the City of London and certain
other large cities, he or she is known as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish regions
and islands areas the chairman is called the convener and the chairman of
the district councils of each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No
general title is laid down for the chairmen of the other district councils, but
some are known as conveners, while others continue to use the old title of
‘provost’.
The normal term of office for a councillor elected to any form of local
government is usually four years. In England and Wales county council
elections took place in 1977 and will be held every fourth year thereafter.
Metropolitan district elections are held for a third of the seats in each year when
there is no county council election. Non-metropolitan district councils may
adopt the same procedure or opt for whole council elections; the latter took
place in 1979 and will be held again every fourth year. In London elections to
the Greater London Council were held in 1977 and elections to the London
borough councils in 1978; elections will be held every fourth year. In Scotland
elections for the regions and islands areas took place in 1978, and will be held
again in 1982. Elections for the districts were held in 1977, again in 1980 and
thereafter will take place every four years. Elections for the district councils in
Northern Ireland took place in 1977 and will be held every fourth year
thereafter.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at
a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is aged 18
years or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject
to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the
area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a local
government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annu¬
ally), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland there are
slightly different residence requirements.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands as
a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. Candidates
must be British subjects or citizens of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over.
In addition they must be registered as a local government elector in the area of
the local authority to which they seek election; or have resided or occupied (as
owner or tenant) land or other premises in that area during the whole of the 12
months preceding the day on which they are nominated as candidates or, in
that 12 months, have had their principal or only place of work there. Candi¬
dates are also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to
ensure that unsuitable people do not offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors. Districts in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In
Scotland in the regions and islands areas the electoral areas are called electoral
divisions, each returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards,
GOVERNMENT
Functions and
Services

similarly returning a single member. For parish or community council elec¬
tions in England and Wales, each parish or community, or ward of a parish or
community (or, in some cases, a combination of parishes or communities)
forms an electoral area which returns one or more members. For elections to
the Greater London Council, Greater London is divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer
concerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are
more restricted. There is no postal voting for parish or community council
elections. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in the electoral area:
he or she need not record every vote, but must not give more than one vote for
each candidate. In Northern Ireland local government elections are held on the
basis of proportional representation and electoral wards are grouped into
district electoral areas. Facilities for postal voting are available.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England county councils are generally responsible for strategic planning,
transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer protection,
refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the per¬
sonal social services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan areas
and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are respon¬
sible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most
planning applications, and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street
car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an autonomous committee of the GLC. Responsibility for high¬
ways in London is divided according to the type of road: the main strategic
road network is a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs look after
the other roads. The boroughs have prime responsibility for the provision of
housing. The GLC, which has maintained a substantial stock of housing, has
relinquished its role as a primary housing authority (by transferring its housing
stock to the boroughs and surrounding districts and by offering tenants the
chance to buy their own homes) to concentrate on its strategic role focusing
attention on areas of particular housing need. London’s police force (see p 105)
is directly responsible to the Home Secretary.

In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non¬
metropolitan areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district
councils are responsible for refuse disposal as well as collection; they may,
subject to the consent of the county council, provide on-street as well as
off-street car parking facilities; and they may, exceptionally, be responsible for
library facilities.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their
functions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The
exceptions to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the
personal social services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales.
Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because of their isolation from the
mainland, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services are
administered by the district councils, but responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district by a local office
of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland working closely
with the district council and its staff. Area boards, responsible to central
departments, administer locally education, public libraries and the health and
personal social services. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, respon¬
sible to the Department of the Environment, administers housing.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements for discharging their responsibilities. Most councils use
the committee system, whereby questions of policy and principle are decided
in full council, and committees are appointed to administer the various ser¬
vices. Parish and community councils in England and Wales are often able to
do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint committees from
time to time as necessary. Some councils have established policy advisory or
co-ordinating committees with powers to originate policy, subject to the
approval of the full council. The powers and duties of local authority
committees (which may be advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the
appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p 66), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute; these are legally reserved to
the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the
discharge of their functions. These include co-operation through joint com¬
mittees, joint teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge func¬
tions for another, and may also supply others with a range of goods and
services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and
of committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if
the council (or committee) decides that publicity for that matter would be
prejudicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Over 2 million
people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These include
administrative, professional and technical staff, teachers and manual workers.

Although a few appointments, such as chief education and fire officers and the
director of social services, must by law be made by all the authorities respon¬
sible for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size and composition of their
work forces and the way they should be used. An authority must not, however,
employ one of its own councillors. In Northern Ireland, each council must by
law appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; officers employed in an administrative, professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
on the recommendation of the committee or committees particularly con¬
cerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are
also responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engage¬
ments always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees are
informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council, although there are recommended
scales.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was about £24,000 million in 1979. A clear distinction is
made between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just
under a quarter of the total) is financed partly from the current account surplus
(about half), partly from borrowing (two-fifths) and the remainder from
grants and other incomes. Housing, the major element, accounted for over half
the total in 1979. Current expenditure by local authorities accounts for just
over a quarter of total current account spending by central and local govern¬
ment. The education service represents over a third of this expenditure,
followed by the police, personal social services, roads (including lighting),
public health and debt interest. Current expenditure is financed mainly from
central government grants (about three-fifths) and from local rates paid by
occupiers of land and buildings (about one-third). Each local authority is
responsible for its own finance, although in a few cases several authorities
combine to provide a specialist service which it would be uneconomic for each
to provide on its own.
Government ‘rate support grants’ to local authorities are paid in aid of revenues
generally. Grants are also paid towards the cost of specific services—either
towards current expenditure, such as on the police, or towards capital expendi¬
ture, such as on the acquisition and clearance of derelict land. (In Wales and
Scotland approved schemes for acquiring and clearing derelict land are
financed by the Welsh and Scottish Development Agencies.) Annual subsidies
are paid for local authority housing.
Grants are also made towards the cost of rate rebates for people with low
incomes.
Hitherto rate support grants were distributed among authorities in three
parts: the ‘needs’ element, designed to give most help to authorities whose
spending needs were greatest; the ‘resources’ element, used to supplement the
rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of population fell
below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’ element,
which compensated authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
66
Rates
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
poundage which they were required to give to householders. The formula for
distributing the ‘needs’ element was subject to annual variations.
The Government has proposed a new system for the distribution of rate
support grant to local authorities in England and Wales, to take effect from
1981-82. This would consist of a single block grant in place of the needs and
resources elements of the present grant, while ceilings would be prescribed for
the level of total local authority capital expenditure. Authorities would receive
annual capital amounts for housing, education, social services, transport and
other services as they do at present, but would be free to determine their own
spending priorities by the transfer of resources between spending allocations.
One of the effects of the new rate support grant system would be to ensure that
high-spending local authorities do not pre-empt even larger shares of govern¬
ment money, reducing the amount available to those which observe national
financial guidelines.
In Scotland the system for the distribution of rate support grant is under
review; local authority capital expenditure has been subject to direct control
since 1975, which has been administered since 1977 in conjunction with a
financial planning system.
In Northern Ireland district councils receive certain specific grants (for
example, for the acquisition of open space) and grants to compensate them for
loss of rate income arising from the partial derating of industrial premises. In
addition, councils whose rating resources are below a standard level receive a
resources grant to bring them up to that level.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the
rateable value of a property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value) by
the rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the authority
according to its projected financial needs. In England and Wales rateable
values are assessed periodically by the Board of Inland Revenue (see p 48). The
last general revaluation of all property was in 1973. Disputes about rating
assessments are heard by local valuation courts, and on appeal by the Lands
Tribunal. Public undertakings have their rates determined separately. Crown
property is not rateable but payments are made, based on values assessed by
the Treasury Valuer, in lieu of rates.
In Scotland valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional
and islands councils but independent of them. The last general revaluation was
in 1978. Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committees of each valua¬
tion area and thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of
Session.
In Northern Ireland valuations are carried out by the Valuation Officer of
the Department of Finance. There is a right of appeal. The present valuations
came into force in 1976.
Responsibility for levying and collecting rates in England and Wales lies
with the district councils and London borough councils. Each county council
(and the Greater London Council) determines the rate required to meet its
estimated expenditure, and district councils (and London borough councils)
include this element in the rate they levy. Householders benefit from domestic
rate relief and those with lower incomes may also qualify for rate rebates; both
reliefs are financed by government grants. Rates may be paid by instalments,
normally in ten one-monthly payments. Rating relief is available in certain
circumstances on premises adapted for the use of the disabled. Agricultural

land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and places of religious
worship are exempted from rate payments. Charities pay half the full rate on
premises occupied for charitable purposes and may be given further relief by
rating authorities, who can also reduce or remit the rates for a wide range of
non-profit-making bodies.
Rates may be levied on empty properties at any percentage up to the full
amount and in the case of empty commercial property a rating surcharge may
be payable.
In Scotland every authority determines a rate for its own services, but the
collection of rates and the administration of rating is the responsibility of
regional and island councils. Industrial (including freight transport) premises
in Scotland are rated at a half of the net annual value and the right to pay rates
in instalments extends to all ratepayers. There is empty property rating in
Scotland but no empty property surcharge.
In Northern Ireland there are two rates: one set by the district councils and
one set by the Department of Finance. Both are collected by the Department
and the appropriate part paid over to the respective councils. Industrial
(including freight transport) premises are rated at a quarter of net annual value
and the degree of charitable exemption is decided by the Valuation Office.
Empty properties are not rated.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers. For items of expenditure in key sectors (such as education,
housing and roads) local authorities in England and Wales must seek central
government approval before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each
authority receives an annual loan authorisation within which it determines
the sums to borrow and the projects to undertake. The GLC applies
annually for parliamentary sanction to raise the money needed for capital
expenditure while the City of London has ancient charter powers to cover its
borrowings. In Northern Ireland long-term borrowing by district councils is
subject to central approval; in Scotland central approval is given to capital
expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern
Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a
proportion of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily
for a limited proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council
concerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial
policy of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory require¬
ment for local authorities to appoint a finance committee, but they have to
make proper arrangements for the administration of their financial affairs.)
Local authorities must have their accounts audited. Those in England and
Wales can choose between the district auditor (appointed by the Secretary of
State for the Environment) and an approved private auditor.
In Scotland the auditing of accounts is the responsibility of the independent
Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland appointed by the
Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland it is carried out by
independent local government auditors appointed by the Department of the
Environment.

THE FIRE SERVICES
Every part of Britain is covered by a local fire service, which is subject to a
measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities. Northern
Ireland has its own service responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of
the Environment.
Each of Britain’s 64 fire authorities must by law make provision for fire¬
fighting, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient strength to meet all
normal requirements (in some parts of Scotland, authorities combine to pro¬
vide fire cover). Other fire-fighting organisations are maintained, for instance,
by the Army and Air Force Departments of the Ministry of Defence; by the
Department of Industry at certain establishments; and by some large indus¬
trial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively. Central
control is directed mainly towards ensuring the operational efficiency of
brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regulations on appoint¬
ments and promotions, standards of training and equipment, pensions, and
disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for reductions in the
strengths of fire brigades. Each minister is advised by a Central Fire Brigades
Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the respective home departments,
representatives of local authorities and of the associations representing mem¬
bers of fire brigades and other people with special qualifications, appointed by
the minister concerned. Inspectorates of fire services advise on operational and
technical matters. Most fire brigades include part-time personnel to augment
and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call-out and
attendance fee. Volunteer members (who receive no payment) undertake to
attend a fire if called upon. Fire authorities also employ people for duties in
controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. There are about
39,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time operational members of fire brigades in
Britain.
Every fire authority must buy the appliances and equipment necessary to
meet all normal fire-fighting requirements in its area. Certain equipment is
standardised so that there is complete interchangeability when a fire is
attended by brigades from more than one area. The principal types of fire¬
fighting appliances are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications
approved by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department
on the advice of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifica¬
tions ensure that minimum standards are maintained, and allow sufficient
freedom of design to meet special circumstances and encourage further
developments.
A complaints system for local government in England, Wales and Scotland
involves independent statutory Commissions for Local Administration com¬
prising local commissioners (local government Ombudsmen). The English
Commission consists of three local commissioners and the Welsh and Scottish
commissions have one each. All commissioners are responsible in their particu¬
lar area for investigating citizens’ complaints of maladministration by local
authorities. The commissioners help local authority councillors to protect the
interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils
and certain other public bodies.

GOVERNMENT 69
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scot¬
land) for its brigade.
Central control is exercised by the Chief Fire Officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which
most brigade areas are divided are responsible for mobilising forces to deal with
outbreaks of fire. Constant communication is maintained between divisional
and brigade headquarters and, if a fire should be beyond the capabilities of a
division, help is sent from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from
another fire authority. Under mutual help arrangements the nearest available
force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
Fire authorities are concerned in some way with fire precautions in most
buildings used by the public and have major responsibility in enforcing legisla¬
tion concerning fire precautions. They must also make efficient arrangements
for giving advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of fires, and means
of escape. Courses in fire prevention are held at the Fire Service Technical
College for fire brigade officers. In addition to their enforcement and advisory
duties, brigades are also involved in education and publicity to promote fire
safety, particularly in the home. The Government is advised on prevention by
the Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory
Councils, representing the fire service and central and local authorities.
Research into health hazards to firemen, fire brigade organisation and fire¬
fighting equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help of the fire
service under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research of the
Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects are
undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or, under contract
to the Home Office, by other government agencies, notably the Fire Research
Station, which is part of the Building Research Establishment of the Depart¬
ment of the Environment, or by private consultants. The Fire Research
Station is the main organisation studying and investigating technical aspects of
fire.
Fire authorities can use their brigades and equipment for purposes other than
fire-fighting, and they are used, free of charge, in a variety of emergencies
(such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of
premises, leakage of harmful gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals
from dangerous situations). Brigades are also used by prior arrangement for
such purposes as emptying swimming pools and filling water tanks.
The direct cost of damage to buildings and goods destroyed by fires in Britain
in 1979 amounted to an estimated £355-3 million (consequential losses from
the interruption of business are not included in this total). Experience indi¬
cates that most fires involving heavy losses occur at night; and fires are more
likely to start in storage areas than in production departments. Industries
which suffer most severely include engineering and electrical firms, textiles,
food, drink and tobacco, warehousing, chemical and allied industries, paper,
printing and publishing firms, and retailing. About 1,000 people, particularly
young children and the elderly, die in fires every year (most of them at home)
and a further 8,000 suffer injuries. Among the chief causes of death are ignition
of clothing by heaters and open fires, and fires started by smoking cigarettes in
bed.
3 Overseas Relations
Britain has varied and world-wide overseas relations. It has diplomatic rela¬
tions with some 150 countries, and with about 20 of these has special treaty
relations providing for common security arrangements, principally through
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Commercial matters form a
major component of relations with other countries, and Britain is a world
financial centre. It has considerable overseas investments and extensive trade
relations, reflecting its dependence on imports for nearly half its food and more
than half of its raw material requirements and the relatively high proportion of
its gross national product accounted for by exports (over a third); for details of
trade and payments, see Chapter 19. British development assistance is pro¬
vided to over 130 countries.
Since 1945 Britain has placed itself in a number of common decision-making
structures or consultative processes with other nations with a view to achieving
common solutions to shared problems—a recognition that, in an increasingly
inter-dependent world, the attainment of overseas objectives and the ability to
exert influence in support of them can best be provided for through interna¬
tional co-operation on a regional or global basis. As a result, Britain is now a
member of some 120 international organisations ranging from the world-wide
United Nations concerned with problems of world peace, international
economic co-operation and social issues to regionally based and technically
orientated bodies. In particular, Britain is a member of the European Com¬
munity whose policies it helps to determine, and is increasingly co-ordinating
its overseas policies through the Community’s political co-operation mechan¬
ism (see p 74). As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain is a part of a
representative cross-section of the international community, which has
evolved from the former British Empire (since 1945 Britain has progressively,
and largely peacefully, dismantled its Empire and prepared some 40 countries
for independence) and whose 44 members share a common language, common
technical standards, similar systems of law and close professional, academic,
and commercial links.
Britain has strong ties, also, with the United States, including a common
language and many common political and cultural traditions.
A long involvement in world affairs has given Britain both a vital interest and
a firm belief in the maintenance of international order governed by respect for a
generally accepted system of law. As a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council it makes support for the United Nations a central
feature of its foreign policy.
Administration The responsibilities of most government departments have a significant over¬
seas dimension, but overall conduct of Britain’s overseas relations is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
acting through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and some 200 British
missions overseas. The latter comprise embassies and high commissions in
nearly 130 countries, together with subordinate consulates general and consu¬
lates, and missions at eight multilateral organisations. These posts, like the
The British
Council
OVERSEAS RELATIONS 71
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, are staffed by members of the Diplomatic
Service (see p 57), together with locally engaged staff. About a third of these
are employed on political and economic work, nearly a quarter on export
promotion and other commercial matters, a fifth on consular and immigration
work, and the remainder on aid administration, information and cultural work,
and communications and other support activities. Other government depart¬
ments which have a primary concern with overseas relations include the
Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade, the Treasury and the Overseas
Development Administration which is part of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, but the involvement of most departments has increased in recent years
with the growing dependence of domestic economic policy on international
decisions and with Britain’s membership of the European Community.
Where questions of overseas policy involve matters within the responsibility
of other departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formulates
policy in consultation with the departments concerned. The balance of respon¬
sibilities is a matter of constant adjustment, and the department with the
predominant functional interest, even though it may be primarily domestic,
takes the lead. This is particularly so in policy concerning the European
Community and international monetary matters. In the case of policy towards
the Community, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office exercises its co¬
ordinating role at official level through the machinery of the Cabinet Office.
A number of other official and unofficial bodies are also involved in the
administration of overseas relations. These include the British Overseas Trade
Board and the Export Credits Guarantee Department which provide export
services for British industry; the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and
Administrations which helps to arrange purchases from British aid funds and
appointments under technical co-operation programmes; and the British
Council (see below), the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Over¬
seas and the Technical Education and Training Organisation for Overseas
Countries1 which, between them, are responsible for administering the bulk of
Britain’s educational assistance programme (see pp 89-90).
The purposes of the British Council, founded in 1934, are defined in its Royal
Charter as the promotion of a wider knowledge of Britain and the English
language abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between
Britain and other countries. (For an outline of Britain’s international scientific
relations see pp 394-6). The activities of the Council, which has staff in over 80
countries, include the teaching of English and the recruitment of British
teachers for posts overseas, administering the Government’s technical co¬
operation training programme; fostering personal contacts overseas and in
Britain between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific areas; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of
British books and periodicals overseas and providing information through
touring exhibitions and bibliographical services; and presenting overseas the
best of British arts. In Britain, the Council is concerned mainly with arranging
programmes for professional visitors and with the placing, administration and
welfare of overseas students. A basic principle is that the Council’s work should
be of benefit both to Britain and to the receiving country.
About 80 per cent of the Council’s budget in 1980-81, a total of some £113
million, is provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (including

funds from the Overseas Development Administration) and on its behalf the
Council is responsible for the implementation of more than 30 cultural agree¬
ments between Britain and other countries. Overseas it acts as education
adviser to Britain’s diplomatic missions and is responsible for educational
assistance in developing countries in which it is represented. Increasingly, the
Council is undertaking education projects paid for by overseas clients and is
providing English classes abroad; these activities are expected to provide about
15 per cent (some £18-5 million) of its income in 1980-81.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original six
countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Lux¬
embourg and the Netherlands—in the European Community on 1 January
1973.1 In a national referendum in 1975, British membership of the Com¬
munity was endorsed, after renegotiation of the terms of membership. Britain
plays a full and positive part in all Community activities seeking actively with
its partners to develop the Community in the interests of all its members.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), set up in 1952, established
a common market for coal and steel and formed the model for the ‘community’
approach to economic integration. It is designed to ensure an orderly supply of
coal and steel to member countries, to promote the rational expansion and
modernisation of production and to provide better conditions of employment
and living for the employees in the industries. The ECSC is financed mainly by
a levy on production and provides funds for capital investment, research and
other programmes as well as loans to help create new jobs where coal seams are
being exhausted or where restructuring of the steel industry is taking place.
Grants are also made to assist redundant coal and steel workers until they find
new employment, or while they are undergoing retraining.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957. It aims to promote a continuous and
balanced economic expansion by establishing a common market and pro¬
gressively approximating the member states’ economic policies. The preamble
to the Treaty includes among the basic objectives of the EEC the laying of the
foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, the
improvement of their living and working conditions, the progressive abolition
of restrictions on trade, and the development of the prosperity of overseas
countries. The initial steps towards the attainment of these objectives have
been the abolition of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and the
establishment of a common customs tariff, the development of a common
policy for agriculture, and the introduction of measures to establish the
free movement of labour, capital and services. At the same time, provision has
been made for the overseas countries which have special links with the
member countries to have preferential treatment in aid and the development
of trade.

The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a second
treaty signed in Rome in 1957, which provided for the co-ordinated develop¬
ment of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful nuclear
activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research programme
(for power production, industrial and medical purposes) to ensure the dis¬
semination of technical information, to facilitate the co-ordination of invest¬
ment in the nuclear field, to ensure an adequate supply of nuclear ores and
fuels, and to develop wider commercial outlets. Since 1959, there has been a
common market for all nuclear materials, while the Community has estab¬
lished common nuclear legislation and a common control system for nuclear
materials to prevent their diversion to purposes other than those declared.
The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
member states in January 1972. Britain thereby became a party to the two
treaties of Rome establishing the EEC and Euratom, adjusted as necessary to
take account of enlargement. Accession to the ECSC was effected by a decision
of the Council of Ministers. The European Communities Act 1972 made the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community and to exercise the rights of membership.
In 1977, following a transitional period during which tariffs on trade in
industrial products between Britain and the original six members were pro¬
gressively reduced, the internal tariffs were abolished and the phased introduc¬
tion of the common customs tariff on British imports from countries neither
members of the Community, nor having any special arrangements with it, was
completed. Britain had also adopted, progressively, the Community system of
agricultural support under the Common Agricultural Policy. The Treaty of
Accession provided for a slightly longer period of adjustment (which ended in
December 1979) with regard to payments to the Community budget. Other
provisions included those relating to participation in the Community’s institu¬
tions and to its relations with Commonwealth and other countries.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
communities were merged in 1967. Each state has one representative on the
Council of Ministers; in the other institutions Britain’s representation is in line
with that of the other large member states (France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, and Italy). English is one of the Community’s official languages.
The Council of Ministers is the principal decision-making body for all major
community questions, member states being represented on it by foreign
ministers or by other ministers as appropriate to the subject under discussion.
The presidency of the Council changes at six-monthly intervals. Britain will
next hold the presidency in the last six months of 1981. Most Council decisions
are taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission (see below). Some
issues may be decided by majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted
according to provisions in the Treaty of Accession. Where very important
interests of member states are involved, however, the Council’s practice is to
proceed only on the basis of unanimity. The Committee of Permanent Rep¬
resentatives (COREPER), composed of the member States’ ambassadors to
the Community, assists the Council by preparing its meetings and co¬
ordinating the work of other subordinate bodies and working groups.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the
provisions of the treaties and Community measures. Delegated to it are some

limited powers of decision relating mainly to the detailed administration of
agriculture. It is composed of 13 commissioners (14 from 1981) nominated by
the member governments; two are from Britain. The President of the Com¬
mission is appointed for a two-year renewable term as the Commission’s
representative and is responsible for its general administration. Each of the
other commissioners is responsible for one or more of the main Community
activities. The Commission is pledged to act independently of national or
sectional interests and to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the
interests of the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made only after
extensive consultation with officials of the national governments and with
producers, trade unions, employers’ associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Commis¬
sion under them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Com¬
munity institutions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rul¬
ings on questions referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of
final appeal, its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest
courts in member states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Com¬
munity institutions and individuals. The Court consists of nine judges (ten
from 1981), assisted by four advocates-general who make reasoned sub¬
missions concerning cases brought before the Court to help it in its interpreta¬
tion and application of Community law.
The elected European Parliament is composed of 410 members, 81 elected
from Britain, who sit according to party affiliation and not nationality. In 1981
Greece will send 24 members to the Parliament. The first direct elections to the
Parliament, which was formerly a nominated body, were held in June 1979,
and elections will subsequently be held every five years. The Parliament is
consulted on and debates all major policy issues of the Community. Members
may question the Council of Ministers and Commission, and have the power
on a two-thirds majority to dismiss the Commission. The Parliament also has
the power to reject in its entirety the Community’s draft annual budget as
presented by the Commission and approved by the Council. A formal concilia¬
tion procedure has been adopted for use in the event of disagreement between
the Parliament and the Council of Ministers on matters with major budgetary
or financial implications.
The European Court of Auditors, set up in 1977, examines all Community
revenue and expenditure to ensure that it has been legally received and spent
and to ensure sound financial management. It draws up an annual report, and
may also submit observations on specific questions at the request of the
Community institutions.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other interests—are consulted by the Council
of Ministers and the Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is
entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 144 (156 from 1981).
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up
political co-operation machinery for the consideration of important problems
of foreign policy. Britain attaches considerable importance to Community
co-operation in this area. Community foreign ministers meet in this framework
several times a year. Close contact is maintained with Community institutions
when appropriate, and decisions are taken by consensus.
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet at least three times

a year as the European Council. Established in 1974, the Council operates
outside the treaty framework and may consider both Community matters and
those arising in the context of political co-operation. As the highest decision
making body in the Community, it discusses issues unresolved in the Council
of Ministers as well as the general problems facing the Community, and lays
down guidelines and an overall political direction for future work.
Community policies are implemented by regulations, which are legally
binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives, which are
binding, as to the result to be achieved, on those member states to which they
are addressed but allow national authorities to decide on the means of
implementation; decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are
addressed (for example, member states, firms, or individuals); and recom¬
mendations and opinions, which have no binding force. The Council can also
indicate a general policy direction through resolutions.
Greece will become the tenth member state in January 1981, and a further
enlargement of the Community is planned. Negotiations with Portugal and
Spain are continuing and it is hoped they will join in 1983. Britain strongly
supports this enlargement as a means of strengthening democracy in Europe.
The member Governments of the Community discuss a wide range of foreign
policy issues and, where possible, reach common positions. At the General
Assembly of the United Nations their policies are closely co-ordinated, and
they have voted together on a large number of issues. They adopted a common
strategy at the 1975 Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe (see p 81-2) and have since co-sponsored a number of proposals to
improve the implementation of the Conference’s Final Act. They have issued a
number of statements on the Middle East, including a declaration in June 1980
setting out their views on the conditions necessary for a comprehensive settle¬
ment of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Other issues to which considerable attention
has been given include human rights issues throughout the world, and south¬
ern Africa, where the Nine have adopted a code of conduct on employment
practices for member states’ companies operating in South Africa, and sup¬
ported efforts to promote internationally acceptable solutions to the problems
of Namibia and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). The Community has also
endorsed a British proposal for a neutral Afghanistan with a view to defusing
the serious situation which has followed the Soviet Union’s invasion of that
country.
On international trade matters the Community adopted a common negotiat¬
ing position in the latest round of the General Agreements on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT, see p 372) multilateral trade negotiations concluded in 1979.
Commercial co-operation agreements have been concluded with a large
number of countries in the Mediterranean area, the South Asian sub¬
continent, Latin America and other areas and with the Association of South
East Asian Nations. Dialogues covering trade and other matters have taken
place with regional groupings of Latin American and Arab countries.
The Community has also improved progressively its generalised scheme of
preferences, which covers manufactures and semi-manufactures exported by
developing countries, with the aim in particular of benefiting the poorest
developing countries (see p 374).

appropriate chapters.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The most recent convention governing aid, trade and co-operation between
the Community and 58 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific (ACP), the second Lome Convention, came into operation in 1980.
This provides for increased aid and European Investment Bank lending of
about £3,345 million, industrial and agricultural co-operation, an extension of
the scheme designed to stabilise the commodity export earnings of the ACP
countries, assistance for ACP mineral producers whose production and income
suffer from temporary disruptions beyond their control, and duty-free access
to the Community of ACP countries’ exports of all industrial and most agricul¬
tural goods, including improved access for exports such as rum and beef. All
British dependent territories (with the exception of Bermuda, Gibraltar and
Hong Kong), together with the overseas countries and territories of other
Community members, are formally linked with the Community as a whole
under conditions similar to those in the Lome Convention.
Britain has played a leading part in urging the Community to adopt a new aid
and development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a
world-wide basis, thereby encompassing those developing countries (many of
which are among the world’s poorest) not covered by the Lome Convention or
having any other special relationship with the Community. Although it is still
small, the aid programme for these non-associated states has grown steadily
since 1976 and Britain supports its further expansion.
The Community has contributed to the North-South dialogue (see pp 90-1)
and is providing $385 million (of which Britain’s share is $115 million) to the
$1,000 million special action aid programme agreed upon in 1977 at the
Conference on International Economic Co-operation.
Internal Policies All member countries contribute to a common budget which provides funds
for specific Community policies. The budget is largely financed by an ‘own
resources’ system of levies on agricultural imports, customs duties and a
proportion, not exceeding 1 per cent, of the proceeds of the value added tax
collected on an agreed range of goods and services.
In recent years Britain’s budgetary contributions have been out of balance,
resulting in its being one of the largest net contributors to the budget despite its
relatively low gross domestic product per head. This problem was foreseen
during the accession negotiations, and Britain was given an assurance that, if
unacceptable situations arose, the very survival of the Community would
demand that the institutions find equitable solutions. In 1980 the Community
agreed on proposals providing for more equitable net budgetary contributions
by Britain for the years 1980 and 1981. At the same time it agreed to review by
1982 the pattern of Community expenditure and the operation of the budget
with a view to preventing the recurrence of such ‘unacceptable situations’ to
any Community member. If this is not achieved by 1982, there will be similar
restrictions on the level of Britain’s contribution in 1982 as provided for in 1980
and 1981. In Britain’s view, the Common Agricultural Policy (see chapter 15)
absorbs too large a share of the budget in comparison with other sectors such as
industrial, regional, social and urban policies. (Expenditure on the Policy
accounts for 70 per cent of the total budget, while regional and social policies
take only about 4 per cent each, aid to developing countries 3 per cent, and
projects concerned with research, energy, industry and transport 2-5 per cent.)
This situation, Britain believes, is detrimental to the fundamental objective of
the Community, which is to strengthen the economies of the member states
and, by reducing regional differences, to ensure their harmonious develop¬
ment.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
77
The European Monetary System (see p 208) was established in 1979 with
the aim of promoting monetary stability in Europe. Although Britain does not
participate in the exchange rate mechanism of the scheme, it is taking part in
other aspects such as the development of the new European currency unit and
of the European Monetary Fund.
The European Social Fund finances schemes for the training and
retraining of young people, migrant workers, workers in the textile and
clothing industries, the handicapped and workers leaving agriculture. The
European Regional Development Fund (see p 229) provides grants for indus¬
trial and infrastructure projects in the less developed or industrially declining
regions of the Community with the aim of reducing existing imbalances or
preenting the creation of new imbalances. Britain has received substantial
grants from the two Funds, together with other grants and loans from the
European Coal and Steel Community, the European Investment Bank (see p
230) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (see p
292).
Other areas of action include industrial policy, where the Community has
taken an active role in safeguarding the interests of the steel industry, energy,
environment and transport policy.
THE COMMONWEALTH
Britain is a member of the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 44
independent states with a combined population of some 1,000 million, about a
quarter of the world total. Britain participates fully in all activities of the
Commonwealth and values it as a means of consulting and co-operating with
peoples of widely differing cultures, thereby contributing to the promotion of
international understanding and world peace.
Commonwealth members are a representative cross-section of mankind in
all stages of political and economic development. Their peoples are drawn
from practically all the world’s main races and from all continents. As some of
its members are very rich and others very poor, the Commonwealth acts as a
bridge between rich and poor nations.
The member states are Australia, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados,
Botswana, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana,
Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi,
Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New
Guinea, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra
Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga,
Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia
and Zimbabwe. Nauru, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu are
special members which are entitled to take part in all functional Common¬
wealth meetings and activities but not meetings of heads of Government. The
Queen is recognised as head of the Commonwealth; she is also head of State in
15 countries, the remainder having their own monarchs or presidents.
The origin of the Commonwealth lies in the gradual granting of self-
government to the older-established British colonies (later known as the
Dominions) in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa1 where
European settlement had occurred on a large scale. During the last half
of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth, restrictions
on the independence of the Dominions were gradually relaxed and their
1 South Africa ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth in 1961.
?8
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
fully-independent status in relation to Britain was legally formulated in the
Statute of Westminster of 1931.
The main expansion in Commonwealth membership took place after the
second world war following Britain’s decision to guide its dependent territories
towards self-government and independence. This process began in 1947 with
the independence of India and Pakistan,1 and in 1957 Ghana became the first
British African territory to become independent. By the end of the 1960s
nearly all the British dependencies in Africa had gained their independence as
had many territories in the Caribbean and in Asia. The most recent Common¬
wealth members (1980) are Zimbabwe and Vanuatu.
Consultation As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain participates in a system of mutual
consultation and co-operation. The Commonwealth does not formulate central
policies on, say, economic or foreign affairs. Nevertheless the extent of the
consultation and co-operation, which is considerable, is not only of benefit to
member countries but also contributes to international understanding.
Consultation takes place through diplomatic representatives known as High
Commissioners, meetings of heads of Government, specialised conferences of
other ministers and officials, and discussions at international conferences and
the United Nations. Trade and cultural exhibitions and conferences of profes¬
sional and unofficial medical, cultural, educational and economic organisa¬
tions are other ways in which frequent contacts are made.
Heads of Government usually meet every two years, most recently in Lusaka
in 1979. The next meeting will be held in Melbourne in 1981. Proceedings are
normally in private thereby facilitating a frank, free and informal exchange of
views. On international affairs no formal decisions are taken and no attempt is
made to formulate specifically Commonwealth policies, although, on occasion,
common views on matters of major international concern are formulated and
reflected in the communiques issued at the end of the meetings.
One of the most important Commonwealth activities is consultation and
co-operation in economic affairs. Finance ministers meet annually to discuss
world economic problems, these meetings being held on the eve of those of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In recent years ministers
have paid particular attention to the problems of development and the estab¬
lishment of a fairer international economic order. Other ministerial meet¬
ings include the regular Commonwealth Education, Commonwealth Law
Ministers’ and Commonwealth Medical Conferences, last held in 1980.
The The Commonwealth Secretariat provides the central organisation for consulta-
Commonwealth tion and co-operation among member states. Established in London in 1965,
Secretariat headed by a Secretary-General appointed by the heads of Government, and
financed by member governments, the Secretariat is responsible to Common¬
wealth Governments collectively.
As the main agency for multilateral communication between Governments,
the Secretariat promotes consultation, disseminates information on matters of
common concern, and organises meetings and conferences, including those of
heads of Government and of ministers. It co-ordinates many Commonwealth
activities, its main areas of operation being international affairs, economic
affairs, education, information, legal matters, medical and scientific affairs,
youth activities, and applied studies in government. It also administers the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation.
Pakistan left the Commonwealth in 1972.

Because of its neutral position the Secretariat has been able to make its good
offices available in cases of dispute, and has carried out, on request, special
assignments requiring demonstrable impartiality.
Britain plays an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation established within the Commonwealth Secretariat to
provide technical co-operation for economic and social development in Com¬
monwealth developing countries. The Fund is financed by contributions from
both developed and developing states, Britain contributing about a third of its
expenditure (Canada is the other major contributor). In 1980-81 the Fund’s
resources will amount to some £12 million.
The Fund provides experts to undertake advisory assignments or fill specific
posts and uses consultancy firms to make studies for governments. Its educa¬
tion and training programme is of particular help in raising levels of technical
and vocational skill, and makes wide use of training facilities within developing
member countries for the benefit of other developing countries. It has a special
programme to help countries develop their exports, another on food produc¬
tion and rural development and a small technical assistance group to give
advice in key areas. An industrial development unit is the main executive
agency of the Commonwealth Action Programme of Industrial Co-operation
established in 1979.
Expenditure by Britain on technical co-operation with Commonwealth
developing countries in 1979 was £91 million, the greater part being spent on
financing staff for service for Commonwealth Governments (£48 million) and
in financing training places in Britain for people from Commonwealth
countries (£19 million); volunteers are also sent from Britain to serve overseas.
Other technical help includes sending consultants to carry out feasibility
surveys, the supply of training and research equipment, and making available
the advisory services of British scientific and technical institutions.
Britain is a major contributor to the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, a system of awards for people of high intellectual promise to
study in Commonwealth countries other than their own, and provides 650
awards annually out of a total of over 1,000 within the scheme. Under the Aid
for the Commonwealth Teaching of Science Scheme, Britain sends out experts
to serve in curriculum development units, institutes of education and the
inspectorates of ministries of education.
British financial aid to Commonwealth developing countries totalled £342
million in 1979 and included investment finance from the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (see p 89).
A large number of organisations are concerned with the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth Institute, financed largely by the British Government,
promotes knowledge about the Commonwealth through films, library ser¬
vices, lecture tours by members of the staff and study conferences for students;
its headquarters in London has a permanent public exhibition depicting the
life of member states, each country financing its own stand. The Common¬
wealth Foundation, financed by member Governments, administers a fund for
increasing co-operation between professional organisations; it has assisted in
the creation of 21 Commonwealth-wide professional associations, helped in the
creation and growth of many national ones, and has created some 14 multi¬
disciplinary professional centres. The Royal Commonwealth Society, which is
over 100 years old, is a centre for the study and discussion of Commonwealth

affairs, its library in London having one of the world’s largest collections on the
Commonwealth. The Society has branches, affiliated organisations and rep¬
resentatives in many countries.
In keeping with the fact that the Commonwealth is an association of peoples
as well as Governments, many unofficial organisations, professional bodies
and voluntary societies provide machinery for co-operation. Professional
bodies include associations of architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers, lib¬
rarians, magistrates, museum curators, nurses, pharmacists, planners, sur¬
veyors, and veterinary surgeons. Other organisations include the Common¬
wealth Parliamentary' Association which organises an annual conference of
parliamentarians, the Commonwealth Press Union, the Commonwealth
Broadcasting Association, the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, the
Commonwealth Games Federation, and the Commonwealth Arts Association.
There are 13 remaining British dependent territories: Belize, Bermuda,
British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin
Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands and Dependencies, Gibraltar,
Hong Kong, Montserrat, Pitcairn Island, St. Helena and Dependencies and
the Turks and Caicos Islands. British policy is to give independence to those
territories that want it, and not to force it on those which do not.
The population of the dependencies is about 5-25 million, ranging from
Hong Kong with about 5 million people to Pitcairn Island with fewer than 100.
Apart from Hong Kong, only Belize has a population of more than 100,000.
Few of the dependencies are rich in natural resources, and some are scattered
groups of islands. There are no permanent inhabitants in the British Antarctic
Territory or British Indian Ocean Territory.
Most dependencies have considerable self-government with their own legis¬
lature and civil service. Britain is generally responsible, through a Governor,
for defence, internal security and foreign affairs.
Some territories are on the way to independence: the Turks and Caicos
Islands, for example, are expected to become self-governing in late 1980 with
independence following in 1982. There are particular problems associated
with Belize, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar which are the subject of
territorial claims by neighbouring states—Guatemala, Argentina and Spain
respectively. In all three cases Britain refuses to accept that British sovereignty
is in doubt. In Belize British policy, supported by the United Nations, is to
bring the territory to secure independence as soon as possible. Britain has
pointed out that Belize would be independent now had it not been for the
Guatemalan claim. Fresh British proposals for a settlement were made to
Guatemala in 1978 but were rejected. In both the Falkland Islands and
Gibraltar the inhabitants wish to retain the link with Britain, and the Govern¬
ment is pledged not to support any transfer of sovereignty against their wishes.
Two territories in the Caribbean—St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, and Antigua,
which have a combined population of some 140,000—are known as Associated
States, a status providing for complete control of internal affairs with Britain
retaining responsibility for external relations and defence. This arrangement
originally covered six territories but four—Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia,
and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines—have since become independent.
Associated statehood is entirely voluntary and can be terminated at any time
by either party. Unlike dependencies, Associated States can proceed to inde¬
pendence without the consent or assistance of the British Government. Legis¬
lation to this effect has to be approved by a two-thirds majority in the territory’s
legislature and by a two-thirds majority in a referendum. Alternatively the
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
81
British Government can end the associated status through an Order in Coun¬
cil, the procedure followed at the request of all those which have become
independent. Britain considers it right to take such action at an Associated
State’s request provided that it is satisfied that the majority of the people want
independence and that the proposed independence constitution makes proper
provision for the preservation of fundamental rights and freedoms.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY
One of Britain’s foremost foreign policy concerns is to protect its territorial
integrity and political independence, as well as the interests of its remaining
dependencies and Associated States and of its allies. The attainment of these
objectives is seen as depending on an effective national security policy, in
which defence is coupled with strenuous efforts towards removing or alleviat¬
ing the causes of international tension, and widening and strengthening inter¬
national arms control and disarmament measures.
British defence policy (see Chapter 4) is based on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO)1 which member countries regard as their guarantor of
security, freedom and well-being, and as an important contribution to interna¬
tional peace and stability. All the members share a belief in democracy, human
rights, justice and social progress. Britain makes a major contribution, devot¬
ing to NATO the greatest proportion of its defence effort and concentrating
this in areas where it can best support NATO’s security objectives.
NATO’s twin aims are defence and detente. It pursues a strategy of deter¬
rence, designed to convince any potential aggressor that the use of force, or the
threat of it, carries risks far outweighing any likely advantage. In recent years
NATO has placed increasing emphasis upon complementing its defensive
capability with efforts to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements
with a view to maintaining the balance of security at a lower level of risk. In late
1979 it put forward a new package of proposals on arms control and disarma¬
ment designed to improve mutual security and co-operation in Europe.
The Soviet Union’s invasion and subsequent occupation of Afghanistan has
seriously damaged detente, but NATO has reaffirmed its attachment to it and
its willingness to work for the improvement of East-West relations. At the
same time it has reminded the Soviet Union that detente cannot be pursued in
one region of the world regardless of developments in another and called on it
to take positive action, including the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan
to live up to the peaceful intentions it professes, and thereby restore the mutual
confidence necessary for a co-operative East-West relationship.
Outside Europe, Britain is committed to joint consultation with Australia,
New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore under the Five Power Defence
arrangement. It is also responsible for the security of its overseas dependencies
and Associated States, and supports the UN peace-keeping efforts.
Britain seeks genuine improvements in East-West relations based on undi¬
minished security. It takes an active part in arms control and disarmament
negotiations (see pp 82-3), and in the process initiated by the 1975 Helsinki
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It attaches great import-
1 NATO’s 15 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Turkey and the United States. Neither France nor Greece participates fully in NATO’s integrated
military structure.

ance to the full and balanced implementation by all participants of the provisions
of the Conference’s Final Act for increased stability in Europe and improved
co-operation between the 35 European and North American signatory states.
(The Final Act is a charter and code of conduct of behaviour for what the
participants hope will in time become a more normal and open relationship
between both Governments and people in East and West. It includes under¬
takings about security, human rights, and co-operation in economic,
humanitarian and other matters.) Britain participated fully in the 1977-78
Belgrade follow-up meeting at which there was a thorough exchange of views on
the implementation of the Final Act. It has since taken part in the various
expert-level meetings agreed at Belgrade and is actively involved in preparations
for the second follow-up meeting in Madrid in November 1980.
Together with France, the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain is a
signatory to the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin which came into force in
1972. The Agreement reaffirms the four countries’ rights and responsibilities
in Berlin, and provides for greatly improved travel and communications
facilities between Berlin and both the Federal Republic of Germany and the
German Democratic Republic, and for the maintenance and development of
the ties between West Berlin and the Federal Republic.
Britain has played a prominent part in all the major multilateral disarmament
negotiations, and has become party to all the treaties concluded as their result.
(It is a depository government for most of these agreements.) At the United
Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 1978, Britain reaffirmed its
commitment to work for progress through multilateral, balanced and verifiable
arms control and disarmament agreements. It participates in the Committee
on Disarmament (as it did in the Committee’s predecessor, the Conference of
the Committee on Disarmament) and in the arms control and disarmament
work of the United Nations.
One of the world’s nuclear-weapon states, Britain is committed to negotiat¬
ing in good faith to halt the nuclear arms race and to move towards nuclear
disarmament. It is engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union and the
United States for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which, in the British
view, would curb the development of new types of nuclear weapons. Britain
regards the widest international adherence to the treaty as an important
objective; meanwhile, it adheres to the Partial Test Ban Treaty (which bans
nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water), having been,
with the Soviet Union and the United States, one of the first three signatories
in 1963.
Britain fully supported the United States in its efforts to conclude an
agreement with the Soviet Union in the second set of the strategic arms
limitation talks (SALT II), and favours the eventual ratification of the agree¬
ment reached in June 1979 which is designed to establish parity in strategic
nuclear weapons and enhance stability.
Britain believes it is possible to improve international access to the benefits
of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy while minimising the risk of the spread of
nuclear weapons technology, and has played a leading part in strengthening the
regime of non-proliferation through the International Atomic Energy Agency
and other organisations. A party to the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (which
is designed to curb the nuclear arms race and to provide an assurance, through
international safeguards, that civil nuclear activities of non-nuclear-weapon
states will not be diverted to making such weapons), Britain has undertaken
not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states which have
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
83
internationally binding commitments not to manufacture or acquire nuclear
explosive devices (except in the case of an attack on British interests by such a
state in association with a nuclear-weapon state). Britain reaffirmed its full
support for the Treaty at the Treaty’s review conference in 1980.
The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the
world can contribute to non-proliferation and regional security, and Britain
supports proposals for such zones wherever possible. It was the first nuclear-
weapon state to ratify the protocols to the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco).
As a result of a British initiative, another category of weapons of mass
destruction, biological weapons, is the subject of the 1972 Convention on
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriologi¬
cal (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. Britain took an
active part in a conference in March 1980 which reviewed the operation of the
Convention. Britain has also encouraged efforts to agree on a ban on chemical
weapons, and in 1976 put forward a draft convention on the prohibition of their
development, production and stock-piling; this has served as a focus of discus¬
sion in the Committee on Disarmament. Britain believes also that new scien¬
tific discoveries should not be used to create totally new weapons of mass
destruction. In this context, it feels that the best approach is for the Committee
on Disarmament to keep under review the question of the development of such
weapons and to consider the desirability of formulating agreements with
regard to them as and when they are identified.
On conventional weapons, which are still the main component of most
countries’ national armouries, Britain has argued for international discussions
on ways to halt the world-wide build-up. In particular it believes in the value of
regional agreements as a means of facilitating this. In the talks on Mutual and
Balanced Force Reductions, Britain, together with its NATO allies, is working
for an agreement with the Warsaw Pact participants which would contribute to
a more stable relationship and to the strengthening of peace and security in
Europe.1 The NATO position is based on the principle that the outcome
should be one of approximate parity between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces
in central Europe. Britain has also proposed at the United Nations regional
‘confidence-building’ measures, such as notification of military movements
and exchanges of observers, in areas of potential tension.
At a United Nations conference on ‘inhumane’ weapons, Britain has pro¬
posed a convention regulating the use of landmines and booby-traps, and has
supported proposals for bans or restrictions on other weapons deemed likely to
cause unnecessary suffering or to be indiscriminate in their effects.
Britain is concerned about the rising scale of military expenditure in the
world, and has made proposals at the United Nations for a multilateral,
balanced and verifiable reduction of military budgets. It is also playing a
leading part in the United Nations study on the relationship between dis¬
armament and development.
BRITAIN AND THE UNITED NATIONS
Support for the United Nations (UN) and the purposes and principles of its
Charter has been a cornerstone of British policy since 1945. In particular,
1 All NATO countries (except France, Iceland and Portugal) and all Warsaw Pact countries
(Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
the Soviet Union) take part in the talks.

BRITAIN ig8i: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain is concerned that the United Nations should be able to act effectively as
an agency for crisis anticipation, peace-keeping and peace-making; as a forum
for the discussion of major world issues; and as an instrument for development
and for providing a wide variety of specialised and technical services. Britain
also sees a strong and effective United Nations as the best framework for
pursuing and achieving many of its foreign policy objectives—the resolution of
disputes, an ordered North-South dialogue, disarmament and arms control,
the protection of human rights, the promotion of the rule of law—designed to
contribute both to its own wellbeing and security and to the development of a
more harmonious international community.
The United Nations has in recent years had a growing role as the central
institution for the discussion of world issues. In addition to those of peace and
war, these include arms control and disarmament, disaster relief, the sea-bed,
action against terrorism, the world environment, energy, development and
world resources. While in some cases there are specialised institutions, usually
UN agencies, for dealing with these issues, in many others, including most of
those referred to above, discussion takes place mainly in the United Nations
itself. Britain plays an active and positive role in these debates.
Keeping the The maintenance of international peace and security, the primary purpose
Peace envisaged for the United Nations at the time of its establishment, remains one
of the world’s greatest problems. Britain supports the view that the United
Nations, as the only forum in which the whole international community is
represented, has the right and duty to be involved in disputes which threaten
peace and stability whether on a regional or world scale. In concert with other
members, it has worked to strengthen and make more effective the machinery
of the Security Council, the organ with primary responsibility for security
matters, for preventing and settling disputes. As a permanent member of the
Security Council, Britain has a particular interest in and responsibility for
questions of international peace and security, and plays an active role in the
Council’s work.
Another British concern is that the United Nations should have the capacity
to play an effective peace-keeping role. Britain currently supplies the largest
national contingent to the UN Force in Cyprus, together with logistic support
for the entire force, and provides some logistic support for the UN Interim
Force in Lebanon.
Human Rights Britain has supported the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights since
its adoption by the General Assembly in 1948. While not legally binding, the
Declaration has inspired many other international instruments designed to
secure the observance of its provisions. These include the two international
covenants adopted by the General Assembly in 1966 which do impose legal
obligations on those who ratify them—the Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Both came into
force, and were ratified by Britain, in 1976. Britain has accepted Article 41 of
the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognising the competence of the
UN Human Rights Committee (set up to supervise the Covenant’s implemen¬
tation) to receive and consider state-to-state complaints.
Britain is also a party to a number of more specific conventions aimed at
implementing particular rights contained in the Universal Declaration, includ¬
ing those on the elimination of racial discrimination, on the rights of women, i
the status of refugees and stateless persons and slavery.
Britain recognises, however, that the adoption of conventions and covenants
Economic and
Social Affairs
OVERSEAS RELATIONS 85
in itself is insufficient to secure the protection of human rights, and believes it
is necessary to develop effective procedures to ensure the implementation of
standards which such arrangements contain. Britain also believes that UN
member states, through their voluntary acceptance of the Universal Declara¬
tion and the international covenants, have demonstrated that abuses of human
rights wherever they occur are the legitimate subject of international concern;
and that a consistent policy on the part of a member government in breach of
these obligations is a proper matter for UN discussion.
Overall responsibility within the United Nations for human rights activities
lies with the Economic and Social Council. The bodies directly concerned are
the Commission on Human Rights, its Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, and the Commission on the
Status of Women. Britain is represented on all these bodies and plays an active
part in their work.
The Charter states that ‘the promotion of the economic and social advance¬
ment of all peoples’ is one of the principal aims of the United Nations, and it is
estimated that some 90 per cent of the organisation’s efforts, in terms of
resources and personnel, are now employed to this end. With the growing
concern for and assistance to meet the problems of development, the main
emphasis in this work has become increasingly the provision of operational
programmes of direct assistance for member states. The UN system is now the
largest single source of technical assistance for developing countries, as well as
providing considerable emergency and relief aid and assistance for refugees.
(The provision of capital assistance has been generally confined to the World
Bank group and regional development banks whose operations are generally
considered separately from those of the rest of the UN system.)
Successive British governments have affirmed their support for the func¬
tional and developmental work of the United Nations and have continued to
increase the amount of funds made available to the UN system for assisting
developing countries. Britain is the seventh largest contributor to the UN’s
regular budget, providing some £io-i million, 4-5 per cent of the total, in 1979.
In addition, it contributed about £3-8 million to the World Health Organisa¬
tion, £2-5 million to the International Labour Organisation, £2-5 million to the
Food and Agriculture Organisation and £3 million to the UN Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Britain provides a considerably larger
proportion of the UN’s voluntary funds, donating some £65*2 million in 1979,
including £28-5 million for the UN Development Programme, £4-4 million for
the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, £5-3 million for the
UN Children’s Fund, £2 million for the UN Fund for Population Activities,
about £8*9 million for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and £6
million for the World Food Programme.
Britain plays an active role in the deliberations of the governing bodies of the
various agencies and programmes, especially with a view to encouraging the
deployment of resources towards the poorest countries and the poorest com¬
munities in the developing world. It also seeks to ensure that the institutions
make the most efficient use of the development resources placed at their
disposal, and to promote improvements in the co-ordination, control and
effectiveness of the system, especially in order to avoid unnecessary duplica¬
tion and overlapping of responsibilities.
The United Nations is central to the North-South dialogue, not only
through the involvement of its agencies in development and other international
economic problems, but also as the forum within which the dialogue is
86
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reviewed. In the General Assembly’s Committee of the Whole, set up in 1978
to monitor developments in the dialogue, and at its special session on global
economic issues in 1980, Britain played an active role in the discussions on a
new international development strategy for the 1980s, believing that this
should reflect the interdependent nature of the world economy and be
addressed to the responsibilities of all governments, irrespective of their level
of development and of their social and economic system (see p 88).
OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
Britain is an active member of a number of other international organisations,
including those concerned with the management of the world economy and
which, therefore, have an important role to play in the North-South dialogue
(see p 90). It is a founder member of the International Monetary Fund,
established in 1944 (along with the World Bank—see p 90) as the principal
administrator of the international financial system and as a source of credit for
member states facing balance of payments problems, and has welcomed the
creation by the Fund of facilities to provide special assistance to developing
countries experiencing financial or trading difficulties. It is a strong supporter
of efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to liberalise
further and promote the growth of world trade, and to improve the developing
countries’ participation in it (see pp 91 and 372)-
Britain is also a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), an instrument for inter-governmental co-operation
among 24 industrialised countries on matters relating to economic and social
policy. Its aims are to promote policies designed to achieve the highest sustain¬
able economic growth and employment, and a rising living standard, in
member countries while maintaining financial stability, and thus to contribute
to the development of the world economy; to contribute to sound economic
expansion in member as well as non-member countries in economic develop¬
ment; and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral,
non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations.
Other organisations to which Britain belongs or extends support are more
restricted in their operations and include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Americas and Asia and specialist technical, agricultural and medi¬
cal institutions.
With 20 other nations Britain is a member of the Council of Europe which
aims to provide the widest possible European forum for the discussion of
current political, economic, social and scientific issues with a view to achieving
a greater unity between its members. Membership is open to any European
state which is a parliamentary democracy and accepts the principles of the rule
of law and the protection of human rights. The Council was responsible for the
adoption in 1950 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which
Britain is a party.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The basic objective of Britain’s aid programme, which is the responsibility of
the Overseas Development Administration, is to help developing countries’
efforts to raise their living standards. This involves assistance in the broadest
sense (from the provision of finance for the purchase of capital goods to expert
advice and training) to supplement developing countries’ own programmes for
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Official Flows
87
generating economic growth and social development. Aid is provided either
bilaterally on a government-to-government basis or multilaterally through
contributions to international development agencies.
Recent British aid policy has focused on reducing absolute poverty in the
developing world, reflecting a recognition that the poorest countries find it
most difficult to generate investment funds domestically or attract external
private flows. The emphasis in the aid programme, therefore, has been on the
poorest countries and on the poorest communities within these countries.
While developmental objectives will continue to be at the basis of British aid
policy, greater weight will in future be given to political, commercial and
industrial considerations in the deployment of aid resources. Britain’s ability to
support development overseas is dependent on the state of its own economy;
the aid programme will be used increasingly in ways which are to the mutual
benefit of both the developing countries and Britain.
In addition to the official aid programme, private investment in developing
countries is encouraged by the provision of government insurance to private
investors by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, and was further
facilitated by the abolition of exchange controls in 1979. An important con¬
tribution is also made by the work of private voluntary organisations.
Since 1945 tota^ official aid disbursements have amounted to about £7,731
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1976-79
was about £705 million. In 1979 official aid flows totalled some £941 million, of
which £876 million represented official development assistance1 and £65
million other official flows. Of the overall total, bilateral aid accounted for £685
million including technical co-operation funds of £185 million; assistance
provided through multilateral agencies was £256 million. Repayments of
capital and payments of interest on loans made previously came to £73 million
and £47 million respectively.
The strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in 1970,
recommended that each developed country should progressively increase its
official development assistance to the developing countries and exert its best
efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of 0-7 per cent of its gross national
product (GNP) annually. Britain has accepted this in principle without
commitment to a target date, progress being dependent on Britain’s own
economy and other calls on resources. In 1979, net disbursements of official
development assistance (see Table 5) amounted to £804 million, 0-43 per cent
of GNP (the net official flow figure was £867 million, 0-46 per cent of GNP).
On a new alternative basis,2 Britain’s net official development assistance in
1979 amounted to £974 million, o\52 per cent of GNP. (The average for all
donor members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee was 0-34
per cent of GNP.) Total net financial flows from Britain to the developing
countries (that is, including private and official flows) amounted to £5,288
million in 1979, some 2-8 per cent of GNP and well above the UN target of 1
per cent of GNP.
1 Official development assistance, the international basis for reporting on aid performances, is
defined as official flows for development purposes with a grant (concessional) element of 25 per
cent or more.
2 On this basis, which is designed to allow stricter comparability with other donor countries,
contributions to multilateral agencies made by means of promissory notes deposited in banks
are taken to represent flows as soon as they are deposited instead of when the agency draws upon
them. This is a technical change in reporting only and does not represent a real increase in aid
flows.

Bilateral Aid
Financial Aid
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The international development strategy for the 1980s agreed at a special
session of the General Assembly in late 1980 (see p 86) envisages the eventual
adoption of a 1 per cent of GNP target for official development assistance by
developed countries, including those with centrally planned economies, and a
speeding up of progress towards the 0-7 per cent target. It also urges greatly
increased aid for the poorest countries and that this should be provided mainly
in grants, a policy already adopted by Britain (see below).
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the world’s
poorest countries. In 1979 £434 million (68 per cent) of bilateral aid went to
Commonwealth countries. Of this, £26 million went to Britain’s remaining
dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid programme, and £3 million to
the Associated States.
In regional terms, most British aid goes to Asia, which in 1979 received £283
million (44 per cent) of the bilateral programme, followed by Africa (£220
million), Latin America and the Caribbean (£42 million) and Oceania (£29
million). The country receiving the largest amount was India with £153
million. Other major recipients included Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malawi,
Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania.
In line with the policy of concentrating aid on the poorest countries, £361
million (57 per cent) of bilateral aid went to countries with a 1978 per capita
income of $320 or less.

Differences between totals and the sum of their constituent parts are due to rounding.
Bilateral financial aid in 1979 totalled £454 million; over 72 per cent was in
grants and the rest in concessionary loans. Budgetary aid, over £11 million in
1979, is provided in the form of grants. Development aid can be in grant or loan
form, but the greater part is provided in grants following a decision to provide
aid to the poorest developing countries (which include India, Bangladesh, Sri
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Technical
Co-operation
89
Lanka and many African countries) in grant form only. The terms of develop¬
ment loans have been progressively relaxed since 1958. In 1979 loan
commitments, excluding investments by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (see below) totalled £39 million. Where loans bear interest it is at
fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2 per cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds
of loan carry from three to seven years’ grace periods, during which repay¬
ments of capital are not made. Of all loans committed in 1979 the average
maturity was 25 years. Britain has more than fulfilled the 1972 and 1978
recommendations of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisa¬
tion for Economic Co-operation and Development on easing the terms of
financial aid. In 1978 Britain announced its intention of removing the burden
of past aid loans (retrospective terms adjustment) worth £900 million to 17 of
the poorest countries.
Loans and grants are normally tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain, although there may be an element for local costs and a
foreign content in contracts financed from tied aid in appropriate cases. New
loan commitments can be untied, if the recipient agrees, to the extent that
goods can be purchased either from the poorest developing countries or from
Britain.
An important role in development assistance is played by Britain’s Com¬
monwealth Development Corporation, set up in 1948 to assist the economic
development of the then dependent territories. Subsequent legislation
extended its area of operations to independent Commonwealth countries
and, with British Government approval, to other countries. By the end of
1979 some £313 million had been invested out of a total commitment of
£449 million. Of the latter £10 million was in East Asia and the Pacific, £62
million in the Caribbean and virtually all of the remainder in Africa.
Commitments approved in 1979 totalled over £83 million, of which nearly
90 per cent went to the poorest countries and 60 per cent to renewable natural
resources projects.
Technical co-operation, the transfer of specialised knowledge and skills from
country to country, is complementary to financial aid, the availability of such
expertise often being a precondition of a successful programme of financial aid
or investment. Expenditure on it has increased in recent years and was £185
million, 29 per cent of bilateral aid, in 1979. Of this, £79 million was for the
provision of expert personnel, including volunteers, £34 million for students
and trainees in Britain and overseas, £11 million for research services and
projects, £19 million for consultancy services, and £42 million in support of
various British institutions, including the British Council, and for the pro¬
vision of equipment and supplies.
During 1979, there were 7,463 people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers) working in developing countries, of whom some 3,478 were
engaged in the field of education, 1,337 in public works and communications,
1,064 in public administration, 981 in agriculture and allied fields, 522 in
health services, and 136 in industrial posts. In addition, under the British
Volunteer Programme there were 1,302 volunteers, mainly graduates or
otherwise qualified, working in developing countries, the majority of them
teaching. Recruitment, training and placing overseas is undertaken by four
voluntary bodies: Catholic Institute for International Relations, International
Voluntary Service, United Nations Association International Service and
Voluntary Service Overseas; 90 per cent of the organisations’ costs are met by
the British Government.

DIALOGUE
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 16,000 were financed in Britain in 1979 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth
Scholarships and Fellowship Plan, and under British Council schemes.
To support practical development activity overseas, the Government main¬
tains four specialist scientific organisations (the Directorate of Overseas Sur¬
veys, the Land Resources Development Centre, the Tropical Products Insti¬
tute and the Centre for Overseas Pest Research) and provides support for many
others. The latter includes overseas uniis/divisions of the government financed
Transport and Road Research Laboratory, the Building Research Establish¬
ment, the Hydraulics Research Station and the Institute of Geological
Sciences. These organisations provide specialist information and advice
and experts for service overseas, and undertake field and laboratory
research investigations.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the
International Finance Corporation. The British commitment to the IDA’s
Fifth Replenishment (for 1977 to 1980) was £474 million, and its proposed
commitment to the Sixth Replenishment (for 1980 to 1983) is £555 million.
Britain has contributed or has agreed to contribute, to the Asian Development
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean Development
Bank and the African Development Fund. Britain’s contribution to the United
Nations Development Programme for 1979 was £28-5 million, and it is the
largest source for expertise and fellowships provided under the Programme. In
addition there is a major British contribution to other UN agencies and
programmes and an increasing proportion of British development assistance is
now channelled through the European Community’s aid programme.
Voluntary agencies provided some £27 million for their work in developing
countries in 1979. The funds were spent mainly on agriculture, health and
nutrition, and education projects and on emergency relief operations. The
Government co-operates with the agencies in various ways, especially in
immediate post-disaster relief and rehabilitation operations and through its
Joint Funding Scheme. Under this Scheme, the Government meets half the
cost of selected development projects undertaken by the agencies and aimed at
helping the poorest. Such projects include community health, non-formal
education, the improvement of food supplies, agricultural training, water
supply and irrigation. Expenditure on the Scheme in 1979 was over £1-5
million.
Voluntary agencies’ work on behalf of refugees overseas also receives
government support. The Government finances about half the annual budget
of the United Kingdom Standing Conference on Refugees, a consultative body
for agencies engaged in assisting refugees, and in 1977 introduced a scheme for
financing voluntary agency projects for refugees overseas. Some £166,500 had
been spent under the scheme by the end of March 1980, the projects being
concerned mainly with improving the health and general well-being of the
refugees. Some, however, were development projects.
The North-South dialogue, which embraces questions of development, trans¬
fer of resources, raw materials, trade and international monetary issues, is
being conducted between the industrialised nations and the developing
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
91
countries with a view to evolving a more equitable balance in the world’s
economy. Britain attaches importance to securing progress in the dialogue,
and, in its approach to the discussions involved, works in close association with
its partners in the European Community. At the Venice economic summit
meeting in June 1980, Britain and six other major Western industrialised
nations welcomed the recent Report of the Independent Commission on
International Development Issues (the Brandt Report), and promised to
consider its recommendations carefully.
As a Community member state Britain contributed significantly to the work
of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.1 The Conference
did not achieve complete success but reached a considerable degree of agree¬
ment particularly on development issues (see p 76).
A major development in aid policy in 1978 was the commitment by major
donor countries, at a ministerial meeting of the Trade and Development Board
of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to adjust the
terms of past bilateral aid to bring them into line with prevailing more relaxed
terms—known as retrospective or retroactive terms adjustment—or to take
equivalent measures. It was following this that Britain decided to relieve 17 of
the poorest countries of debt repayments worth some £900 million to the end of
the century, thus placing past aid to these countries on the same grant-only
basis as present assistance programmes (see p 89).
In the commodities field, Britain took the initiative at the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting in 1975 in giving impetus to the establishment
of price stabilisation arrangements on a commodity-by-commodity basis. This
took shape in the programme of work on individual international commodity
agreements initiated by the Resolution on the Integrated Programme for
Commodities (IPC) adopted by UNCTAD in 1976; the Resolution also called
for a Common Fund to help finance the agreements. In the subsequent
negotiations on the Common Fund and on individual commodities, Britain has
played an active part within the European Community and consumer countries
generally in the search for appropriate solutions. The first agreement con¬
cluded under the IPC was reached in October 1979. A final agreement for the
establishment of the Common Fund was concluded in June 1980.
In 1964 Britain was the first major developed country to support the idea of
extending tariff preferences on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis
to all developing countries. It therefore strongly supported the objectives of
the latest round of multilateral trade negotiations. Set out in the 1973 Tokyo
Declaration (see p 76), these were the further liberalisation of world trade
through the progressive dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and
within this, the provision of special and more favourable treatment for the
developing countries where possible.
Since its entry into the European Community, Britain has adopted the
Community's trade arrangements, which are among the most liberal applied
by industrial nations, and has played a significant role in determining their
nature. In particular it took a major part in the negotiations for the first Lome
Convention (see p 76), not only with a view to safeguarding the trading
interests of Commonwealth developing countries, but also to ensure that
1 The Conference on International Economic Co-operation met in Paris from December 1975 to
June 1977 and was, while it continued, the focal point of the North-South dialogue. It was
attended by representatives of eight western industrial countries (including the European Com¬
munity as a single entity), known as the ‘Group of Eight’; and seven members of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 12 other developing countries, who made up the ‘Group of
19’. Discussions have since reverted to the United Nations and its constituent bodies.
92
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reciprocal preferences would not be demanded from the developing countries
as had been the case with previous Community arrangements. Britain also
contributed to the successful conclusion of the second Lome Convention in
October 1979 (see p 76). In addition, Britain has supported improvements to
the Community’s Generalised System of Preferences scheme (see p 373),
especially with regard to more liberal access into the Community for imports of
manufactured and processed agricultural products and in its application to the
poorest developed countries, particularly those in South Asia. Before entering
the Community, Britain secured a commitment to expand and reinforce
Community trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia, and
this has led to the conclusion of commercial co-operation agreements with
India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Defence
POLICY
For over thirty years Britain’s defence policy has been based on the continued
strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO—see also pp 81)
whose collective defence provides each of its members with far greater security
than any could achieve alone. Britain is fully committed to NATO, and with
the greater part of its military forces assigned to the North Atlantic Alliance
makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent capabilities, both
conventional and nuclear, required to maintain its defences.
Britain is participating fully in the NATO Long Term Defence Programme
which is a major undertaking adopted by the Alliance in 1978 in order to
maintain its defence and deterrent posture in the face of the continuing
build-up in Warsaw Pact military strength. It is also taking an active part in the
programme agreed in 1979 for the modernisation of NATO’s long-range
theatre nuclear forces (see p 95). In the ‘Eurogroup’ Britain and ten other
European members are working to improve the effectiveness of their contribu¬
tion to the Alliance and to achieve better co-ordination, thereby making
the best possible use of the available resources. The sub-groups of the Euro¬
group concentrate on specific areas of co-operation, such as training or
logistics.
The Alliance complements its defence preparations with efforts to reduce
tension and achieve a more just and lasting peaceful order in Europe through
such measures as arms control and disarmament agreements, and Britain plays
a major part in these efforts (see pp 81-3). In recent years, Britain has
withdrawn from its commitments outside NATO wherever this has been
consistent with its fundamental military and political obligations (see p 81).
However, in support of these, and with a view to playing a full part in firm
collective responses by the West to threats to its world-wide interests, it is
taking steps to improve its capability to operate effectively outside NATO
without diminishing its central commitment to the Alliance.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Government as a
whole, which is responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence policy
is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence who is assisted by a
Minister of State, and by three Under-Secretaries of State—for the Navy,
Army and Air Force respectively. They, together with the Chief of the
Defence Staff, the three Service Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for Defence, the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and
Logistics), the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief of Defence Procure¬
ment, form the Defence Council, which deals with major aspects of defence
policy. The Chiefs of Staff Committee is responsible for giving professional
advice on strategy and operations, and on the military implications of defence
94
BRITAIN ig8i: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
policy. The day-to-day management of the three Services is the responsibility
of the Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
Expenditure The defence estimate for 1980-81 totals£10,785 million. This is about 3-5 per
cent more in real terms than in 1979-80, and thus exceeds the NATO aim of an
annual increase in each member’s defence spending of around 3 per cent in real
terms. Planned defence expenditure for the three years from 1981 -82 also fully
accords with this aim. Of the 1980-81 total, £4,527 million (42 per cent) is for
personnel (pay, allowances, pensions), £4,336 million (41 per cent) is for
equipment, and £1,922 million (18 per cent) is for buildings and miscellaneous
stores and services). Using the NATO definition of defence expenditure,
British defence spending in 1980-81 will account for 5-1 per cent of gross
domestic product at market prices. This proportion is 40 per cent greater than
the average for NATO’s European members.

DEPLOYMENT
NATO Strategy The NATO strategy of flexible response, together with the principle of
forward defence, is based on the premise that peace and stability can only be
maintained if a potential aggressor is convinced that it would lose far more than
it could ever hope to gain by the use of force. The strategy is designed to enable
NATO to respond to aggression at a variety of levels, being flexible enough to
allow the appropriate degree of effective military action to be taken. It requires

the possession of a wide range of mobile and well-equipped conventional
forces, and of theatre nuclear and strategic nuclear capabilities which are
sufficiently closely linked together to provide a chain of options from which to
choose the appropriate method of countering aggression.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. The British Polaris strategic force (to be replaced by a Trident force
in the 1990s) represents a unique European contribution to NATO’s nuclear
deterrent, providing a second and independent centre of strategic nuclear
decision-making within the Alliance. Britain’s theatre nuclear systems are also
committed to NATO, and it has agreed to provide bases for 160 of the 464
ground-launched cruise missiles which, with 108 Pershing II missiles, will be
deployed in Europe under a programme agreed in 1979 to modernise NATO’s
long-range theatre nuclear forces.
The Royal Navy is the largest NATO navy in Western Europe, and virtually
all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked for assignment in an emerg¬
ency to NATO. It also contributes to NATO’s Standing Naval Force Atlantic,
Standing Naval Force Channel, and the Naval On Call Force Mediterranean.
The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF) Germany
are deployed in the Federal Republic of Germany. (Britain also maintains a
Field Force in Berlin, but this is not committed to NATO.) The main combat
element of BAOR is First (British) Corps which comprises four armoured
divisions, an artillery division, and an infantry formation. Its peacetime
strength of around 55,000 would be more than doubled on mobilisation by
reinforcements and reserves from Britain (see pp 99-100) and up to 70 per cent
of the British Army would be deployed in Central Europe in wartime. Virtually
all the RAF’s combat and combat support aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF
Germany is a tactical air force with 12 squadrons (one of helicopters) equipped
for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and air-defence roles. In addi¬
tion, combat units based in Britain are part of NATO’s mobile reinforcement
capability. These include the ground elements of the United Kingdom Mobile
Force, the British contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force
(Land) and three squadrons of 22 Special Air Service Regiment. RAF Strike
Command provides forces for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, air
defence and maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, together with trans¬
port forces and air elements for the United Kingdom Mobile Force and Allied
Command Europe Mobile Force (Air).
Forces from all three Services are also stationed at Gibraltar, the position of
which at the western entry to the Mediterranean makes it an important asset
and base for NATO.
In the Mediterranean, British forces are deployed in Cyprus to meet Britain’s
commitment to the United Nations Force (to which Britain provides the
largest component) and to provide for the security of the Sovereign Base Areas.
In Hong Kong, units of all three Services provide a garrison for external
defence, and a Gurkha battalion is stationed in Brunei. A Royal Marines
detachment is maintained in the Falkland Islands; and in the Caribbean, units
of the Army and the RAF provide a garrison for the external defence of Belize,
and a Royal Navy warship is deployed as the Belize guardship.
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the civil
authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and they
have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.

THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces excluding non-United Kingdom personnel totalled
about 319,400 on 1 January 1980, 71,900 in the Royal Navy and Royal
Marines, 159,100 in the Army and 88,400 in the Royal Air Force. The forecast
total for 1 April 1981 15323,300. The armed forces consist entirely of personnel
serving on a voluntary basis. To help to improve force strengths and overcome
shortages of skilled personnel, service conditions are being improved. In
particular, pay has been restored to the levels comparable to those in civilian
life, and the Government has undertaken to maintain it at these levels in
future. The average number of civilian staff expected to be employed by the
Ministry of Defence during 1980-81 is 255,500.
The Women’s Royal Naval Service, the Women’s Royal Army Corps, and
the Women’s Royal Air Force (which have a combined strength of some
12,700) are integral parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve along¬
side servicemen in Britain and overseas, mainly in support roles. Their
importance is expected to increase in coming years, and the possibility of
women bearing arms for self-defence and, perhaps, base defence is being
considered. Nursing services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval
Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess
Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to 22
years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
Recruits to non-commissioned ranks are committed for only a minimum
period of service (about three years, excluding training) and, subject to that
minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may also be
granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience
(appeals for the last being assessed by an independent committee). Commis¬
sions may be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services
there are opportunities for promotion from the ranks. Direct entry to commis¬
sioned ranks is on the basis of educational and other qualifications. All three
Services have schemes for university cadetships.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, supplemented
by further and specialist training during the course of their careers. Young
servicemen and women are encouraged to study for educational qualifications, j
and extensive facilities exist for this. Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads to nationally recognised qualifi- j
cations for a about half the total number of service personnel.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist resettlement the Services provide
an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisations, and
opportunity and assistance to study for suitable civilian qualifications. There
are also opportunities for short- and longer-term retraining both before and
after discharge from the Services.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst,
the Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, or similar institutions. This is followed
by specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Army
Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell. |

defence policy in the Ministry of Defence and on international staffs. Specially
selected senior officers and civilian officials from Britain, the Commonwealth,
NATO and other countries attend the Royal College of Defence Studies in
London, which provides the wider background necessary for those destined to
fill higher appointments.
Considerable operational training is carried out through joint-Service and
inter-allied exercises. All three Services provide training for the armed forces
of allied and Commonwealth countries and for many other countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided into the nuclear strategic force, Royal
Navy general purpose combat forces, European theatre ground forces, other
Army combat forces and Royal Air Force general purpose forces.
The British contribution to NATO’s strategic deterrent comprises the Royal
Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—Resolution, Repulse, Renown,
and Revenge. Each can remain on underwater patrol for long periods and is
equipped with 16 Polaris missiles, armed with nuclear warheads. A £1,000
million programme called ‘Chevaline’, designed to maintain the effectiveness
of the force until its replacement in the early 1990s by a force of four or five
nuclear submarines equipped with Trident missiles, is nearing completion.

Purpose
Combat Forces
Britain’s maritime forces are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, where they provide the majority of forces readily available to NATO.
However, they retain an ability to be deployed world-wide in defence and allied
or national interests. Nearer home they provide protection for Britain’s fishing
interests and the North Sea oil and gas installations.
Equipment The first of a new class of anti-submarine warfare carrier, HMS Invincible,
entered service in 1980, and another two will be deployed by the mid-1980s.
Their primary task will be to act as command ships for anti-submarine warfare
forces. They will deploy the Sea King anti-submarine helicopter, and carry the
Sea Dart missile system and Sea Harrier maritime vertical short-take-off and
landing (V/STOL) aircraft for area air defence and anti-surface ship opera¬
tions. Sea Kings are also embarked on the anti-submarine warfare carriers
HMS Hermes (which is soon to be equipped also with the Sea Harrier) and
HMS Bulwark and the helicopter cruiser HMS Blake. There are five County
class guided-missile destroyers all armed with Seaslug and Seacat surface-to-
air missiles and four with the Exocet surface-to-surface guided-missile system,
the Type 82 guided-missile destroyer HMS Bristol (equipped with the Sea
Dart area air defence missile system and the Ikara anti-submarine guided
weapon system), and seven of the new class of Type 42 Sea Dart guided-missile
destroyers. Other surface vessels include 49 general purpose frigates (compris¬
ing 26 Leander class, seven Tribal class, eight Rothesay class and eight of the
new Type 21 Amazon class), three anti-submarine frigates (including the first
two Type 22 frigates), two anti-aircraft frigates, 37 mine counter-measure
vessels (including HMS Brecon, the first of the Hunt class of glass-reinforced-
plastic mine counter-measure vessels) and seven new Island class offshore
patrol vessels.
The frigate classes are variously armed with automatic guns, surface-to-air
missile systems, underwater detection and anti-submarine weapons. Most
have the Wasp helicopter embarked, which is being replaced, where appro¬
priate, by the Anglo-French Lynx.
Exocet missile systems are being installed in some Leander class and Type
21 frigates, giving these vessels a better surface-to-surface capability, and in
the Type 22 frigates, which also have the Seawolf surface-to-air missile system.
Some Leander class frigates are also equipped with the Ikara anti-submarine
weapon. Eleven nuclear-fleet submarines are in service, and these will be
joined by another, the last of the Swiftsure class, in late 1980; and there are 16
conventional patrol submarines. There is also an amphibious capability com¬
prising the two assault ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid and the Royal
Marines Commando Forces, supported by HMS Hermes and HMS Bulwark
which retain a secondary role as commando ships.
Ships under construction include HMS Illustrious, and HMS Ark Royal, the
second and third of the anti-submarine warfare carriers and four Type 22
frigates. In addition, work is in hand on three of the new Trafalgar class
nuclear-fleet submarines, seven Type 42 Sea Dart destroyers, and eight Hunt
class mine counter-measure vessels.
European The European theatre ground forces consist of B AOR, and the forces stationed
Theatre in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support of the
Ground Forces North Atlantic Alliance (see p 81).
Other Army Other Army combat forces comprise land forces stationed overseas to meet
Combat Forces treaty commitments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p 95).

Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank; Chal¬
lenger, a new main battle tank fitted with Chobham armour, will enter service
in the mid-1980s. A new series of tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles is in
service, including Scorpion and Scimitar, mounting respectively a 76 mm and
a 30 mm gun, Striker, carrying the Swingfire anti-tank missile, and Sultan, a
command vehicle. The primary tracked armoured personnel carrier used by
mechanised infantry battalions is the FV432, which is to be replaced by the
MCV80 beginning in the mid-1980s. Entering service with the infantry is the
crew-portable Milan medium-range anti-tank guided weapon system (all
BAOR’s mechanised infantry units will be equipped with it by the end of 1980)
and the TOW long-range anti-tank guided weapon is to be fitted to the Lynx
helicopter. Artillery units are equipped with the Abbot 105 mm self-propelled
gun, 155 mm and 175 mm self-propelled guns, the 105 mm light gun and Field
Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE). The FH70 155 mm field howitzer
has begun to enter service. Tactical nuclear support is provided by the Lance
missile system. Air defence is provided by the Rapier low-level surface-to-air
missile system and the Blowpipe man-portable very-low-level missile.
*
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
strike/attack, reconnaissance, ground support, airborne early warning, mari¬
time patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling,
communications and the RAF Regiment field squadrons in the anti-aircraft
and ground defence roles.
Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, are employed in air defence. Radar warning is provided
by Shackleton airborne early warning aircraft (to be replaced in the 1980s by
specially equipped Nimrods which will form part of NATO’s integrated
airborne early warning force) and by the ground radars and control and
reporting centres of the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment
system. Jaguars, Buccaneers and Vulcans operate in the strike/
attack role; Jaguars, Canberras and Vulcans are employed for reconnaissance;
Jaguars and the Harrier V/STOL aircraft provide ground support (with the
Harrier also having a tactical reconnaissance capability); and Nimrods are used
for long-range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare and for offshore
surveillance and fishery protection duty. The Tornado multi-role combat
aircraft will replace the Vulcan, Buccaneer, Canberra, Phantom and Lightning
aircraft in their respective roles during the 1980s. The first version, the GRi,
entered service in the strike/attack role in 1980.
The VC 10 provides strategic transport and the Hercules (which also has a
strategic capability) is used for tactical transport over medium ranges. For
short-range tasks, the Wessex and Puma helicopters are used, while for search
and rescue operations Wessex, Whirlwind and Sea King helicopters are used in
Britain. Victor tankers are used for in-flight refuelling, which gives added
range and flexibility to combat aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some of
their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve); others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare

time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency.
The latter include the Territorial Army (TA) whose role is to reinforce the
ground forces committed to NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure home
base in the United Kingdom, the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines
Reserve, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment and the Royal Air Force
Volunteer Reserve. There is also the Ulster Defence Regiment which is a
locally-recruited and largely part-time force designed to support the regular
forces in Northern Ireland. On 1 January 1980 regular reserves totalled
187,900, and volunteer reserves and auxiliary forces 75,600. Cadet forces,
which make a significant contribution to recruitment to the regular forces,
totalled 137,600.
CIVIL DEFENCE
Civil defence arrangements, are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, local
authorities, the police and government departments. Supplementary effort
from volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought in in time of
crisis. Recent policy has aimed at improving the preparedness of local govern¬
ment to meet a war emergency. Since there is common ground between such
planning and that required for a major peace-time emergency or national
disaster a closer relationship in local planning for the different emergencies of
peace and war has also been sought.
Following a review of existing arrangements in 1980, an additional £45
million is to be spent on civil defence in the years to 1983-84, by when annual
expenditure will total £45 million. This will be used to improve the quality of
central and local government planning; increase training opportunities
arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines at the Home Defence
College, Easingwold; help local authorities to plan for better community
involvement in civil defence; and improve the emergency system for de¬
centralised government control and communications. Improvements will also
be made in the communications, equipment and administrative facilities of the
United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation. This includes the
civilian Royal Observer Corps, which is organised to provide public warning of
an attack, of the location and strength of nuclear explosions, and of the
distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive is responsible for liaising between the
Service users and the machinery for procurement, and co-ordination with
industry in the formulation of programmes; this ensures a cost-effective
approach.
Most research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research and
development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. The Ministry’s estab¬
lishments have a very wide technological capability, which has civil as well as
military applications: for example, support is given to civil aerospace projects
and advanced aero-engines. On the development side, the establishments
collaborate closely with the Ministry’s contractors by monitoring their pro-
DEFENCE
IOI
National Projects

gress, and by assisting in testing programmes and in solving particular techni¬
cal problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its
development requires a high initial investment; the cost of British equipment
research and development in 1980-81 is estimated at over £1,490 million. The
search for a more efficient use of resources has focused attention on the
opportunities presented by Allied collaboration for sharing the cost of research
and the development of equipment. This is one of the principal aims of the
NATO Conference of National Armaments Directors in which Britain plays a
full part. In some cases, the outright purchase of foreign equipment is the most
economical solution. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining a sound
national industrial base for defence procurement is recognised, and there is
close consultation between government and industry both in the National
Defence Industries Council and through other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and its European allies is extensive, and is
expected to increase, particularly through the work of the European Pro¬
gramme Group which consists of all NATO’s European members except
Iceland. The Group promotes opportunities for co-operation in defence
equipment procurement among its members and so contributes to greater
co-operation throughout the Alliance. Successful joint projects include the
Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface missile, the Lynx,
Puma and Gazelle helicopters and the Anglo-Belgian family of armoured
combat reconnaissance vehicles. With the Federal Republic of Germany and
Italy, Britain is co-operating in the production and development of the T ornado
multi-role combat aircraft and of medium artillery equipment, the FH70 and
SP70. Britain also favours increased transatlantic co-operation, and, with
other European countries, is collaborating with the United States in the
procurement of a multiple launch rocket system, and discussing with it the
possible joint development of a new generation of air-to-air missiles. Equip¬
ment collaboration also facilitates joint logistic support and training arrange¬
ments, like those taking place among the five European countries which have
agreed to purchase the Lance surface-to-surface missile system from the
United States.
A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include an air defence variant of the Tornado; a
light man-portable anti-armour weapon; a sea-skimming anti-ship missile (Sea
Eagle) to replace the Martel; and a lightweight torpedo (Sting Ray) equipped
with advanced homing devices for anti-submarine warfare. An airborne early
warning (AEW) version of the Nimrod is being developed, equipped with an
advanced AEW radar, which will complement the AEW force which other
NATO countries are planning to procure.
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence Sales
Organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry and
the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment
overseas. In 1980—81 sales of British defence equipment and associated ser¬
vices are expected to amount to some £1,200 million.

J Justice and the Law
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their
own legal systems and law courts. There is substantial similarity on many
points, but considerable differences remain in law and in organisation and
practice. In Northern Ireland procedure closely resembles that of England and
Wales but there are often differences in enacted law. However, a large volume
of modern legislation applies throughout the United Kingdom.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. The criminal law
is concerned with wrongful acts harmful to the community while civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
society among themselves.
The main sources of law are legislation, common law and European Com¬
munity law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament, orders (rules and
regulations made by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament) and
by-laws made by local government or other authorities exercising powers
conferred by Parliament. Common law, the ancient law of the land deduced
from custom and interpreted in court cases by the judges, has never been
precisely defined or codified but forms the basis of the law except when it has
been superseded by legislation.
European Community law (see p 75) is confined mainly to economic and
social matters; in certain circumstances it takes precedence over domestic law.
It is normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most authoritative
rulings are given by the European Court of Justice (see p 74).
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Four distinct stages are involved in the British system of criminal justice: the
enactment of criminal legislation which defines prohibited acts, establishes
criminal courts and provides for the treatment of offenders; the prevention of
crime and the enforcement of the law—largely matters for the police service;
the determination by the courts of the guilt or innocence of people accused of
crimes, and the selection of appropriate sentences for the guilty; and the
treatment of convicted offenders.
A Royal Commission is examining the powers and duties of the police in
England and Wales, the rights and duties of suspects and accused people, and
the process of and responsibility for the prosecution of criminal offences. A
similar review conducted by a departmental committee in Scotland made
recommendations which are under consideration by Parliament.
In spite of plans to reduce public expenditure generally over the period
ending 1983-84, expenditure on the programme for law and order will increase
to reflect the priority given by the Government to these services.
The Criminal
Law
Crime
Statistics
JUSTICE AND THE LAW IO3
The criminal law, like the law generally, undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet
new circumstances. Substantial changes are the responsibility of Parliament.
In practice most legislation affecting the criminal law is government-
sponsored, but there is often consultation between government departments
and bodies representing the legal profession, the police and the probation and
prison services. The views of voluntary bodies are also considered.
Chief constables in England and Wales have a duty to supply statistics relating
to offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their
areas. Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) is contained in
the annual reports of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for
London) the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The differences in the legal systems of the United Kingdom make it imprac¬
tical to analyse in detail trends in criminality for the country as a whole. In
considering trends it has to be remembered that the number of offences
recorded by the police does not cover all offences committed since some
offences go undiscovered and others are not reported to the police. Neverthe¬
less it is clear that, as in western Europe generally, there has been an upsurge in
crime since the early 1950s.
Table 6 shows the rate of indictable offences (the more serious offences)
recorded by the police in 1978 (the latest year for which figures are available) in
England and Wales.

The number of serious offences recorded by the police in England and Wales
in 1979 was 2,537,000, as against 2,561,000 for 1978. Recorded offences of
robbery decreased by 5 per cent in 1979, burglary and fraud and forgery by 3
per cent, and sexual offences and theft and handling of stolen goods, by 2 per
cent. Offences of violence against the person increased by 9 per cent, and
criminal damage, by 5 per cent. The number of serious offences cleared up by
the police in 1979 was 981,000 (41 per cent of the total recorded) compared
with 998,000 (39 per cent) in 1978.

Research is also carried out in university departments, much of it financed by
the Government. The principal university criminological research establish¬
ment is the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides ex gratia compensation
to victims of violent crimes including victims of violence within the family and
to people hurt as a result of attempting to arrest offenders and prevent offences.
It is administered by a board consisting of legally qualified members appointed
by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consulta¬
tion with the Lord Chancellor. Compensation, which is assessed on the basis of
common law damages and usually takes the form of a lump sum payment, has
totalled over £63 million since the Scheme began.
In Northern Ireland there is separate, statutory provision in certain circum¬
stances for compensation from public funds for criminal injuries caused to
people and also for malicious damage to property. Compensation for property
damage includes losses of profits arising from the damage.
Various temporary measures to deal with terrorism in connection with North¬
ern Ireland have affected some aspects of the British criminal justice system.
Wide-ranging emergency powers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
contained in legislation, include: the right to search, arrest and detain sus¬
pected terrorists; the proscription of organisations engaged in terrorism con¬
nected with Northern Ireland affairs and occurring in the United Kingdom;
and the exclusion from Great Britain and Northern Ireland of people involved
in terrorism. There is also a system of controls at ports on passengers travelling
between Great Britain and Ireland.
Trials in Northern Ireland criminal courts of terrorist offences are heard by
a judge without a jury to obviate the danger of intimidation of jurors.
The emergency laws are temporary and must be reviewed periodically; they
have also been subject to independent examination. Although they confer
special powers on the appropriate Secretary of State, they have been used
sparingly. No one can be imprisoned for political beliefs; all prisoners except
those awaiting trial have been found guilty in court of criminal offences.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can
be prosecuted for criminal offences. Procedures for handling complaints
against the police involve two independent elements: the Director of Public
Prosecutions where allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the
Police Complaints Board for Northern Ireland where complaints relate
only to disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 creates extra-territorial offences under
Northern Ireland law so that it is possible to try in the province a person
accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It also enables
evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences in the Irish
Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic.
Crime prevention and crime investigation, preserving the peace and bringing
offenders to trial are primarily the concern of the police service. British police
action in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common consent, for there are
only a small number of officers in relation to the population (roughly one
officer to 425 people). Officers do not normally carry firearms (their only
weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police powers.

There are 43 police forces in England and Wales, eight in Scotland and one (the
Royal Ulster Constabulary) in Northern Ireland. Each is responsible for law
enforcement in its area, but there is constant co-operation among them.
Outside London most counties (regions or islands in Scotland) have their
own police forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined
forces. In London, the Metropolitan Police Force, with headquarters at New
Scotland Yard, is responsible for an area within a radius of about 24 kilometres
(15 miles) from the centre, but excluding the City of London, where there is a
separate force. The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is
almost 128,000 (including nearly 9,800 policewomen); in Northern Ireland
the strength is about 6,800 (arrangements are being made to increase this to
7,500). The size of individual police forces depends on the area and population
served. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is over 22,800.
In addition to the regular police forces, constabularies are maintained by the
British Railways Board, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, the
Ministry of Defence and a few other public bodies. Considerable numbers of
people are employed by commercial security organisations which are subject to
the ordinary law of the land.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority, a
committee consisting of local councillors and, in England and Wales, magis¬
trates. The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In Northern Ireland the police authority is appointed by the Secre¬
tary of State.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for its area. Its functions, some of which are subject to
ministerial approval, include appointing the chief constable, deputy chief
constable and assistant chief constables and, if necessary, calling on them to
retire; fixing the maximum permitted strength of the force; and providing
buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the commissioner of
police and his immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation
of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below assistant
chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authorities on
matters of efficiency, and must submit a written report every year.
The Home Secretary, and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administration and operation of
the police service. They approve the appointment of chief constables, and may
require a police authority to retire a chief constable in the interests of effi¬
ciency, call for a report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the
policing of his area, or institute a local inquiry. They also have the power to
make regulations covering such matters as police ranks; qualifications for
appointment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay
and allowances; and uniform. Some of these regulations are first negotiable on
the Police Negotiating Board, which has an independent chairman and rep¬
resentatives of the police authorities, police staff associations and the home
departments. Matters of a non-negotiable kind are discussed by the Police
Advisory Boards, together with any general questions affecting the police
service. Other regulations are discussed on representative advisory bodies,
together with any general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
io6
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection. Inspec¬
tors of constabulary carry out, under Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary
and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, a formal
annual inspection of the forces in their regions, inquiring into efficiency and
reporting to the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Annual
reports are published, covering the whole range of police matters. The inspec¬
tors also maintain close touch with forces for which they are responsible, and
have various advisory functions.
In Northern Ireland periodic inspections of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
are made by Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary.
Finance The police authorities are financed by central and local government. The
central government’s contribution, which is a half of approved expenditure (a
third in the City of London), is conditional on the Home Secretary or the
Secretary of State for Scotland being satisfied that a force is being efficiently
administered and maintained.
Officers and In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men and women between
Ancillary Staff the ages of 183 and 30. A chief constable may approve the appointment of
especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in England, Scotland and Wales (except in the
Metropolitan Police and City of London Police areas) are: chief constable,
assistant chief constable, chief superintendent, superintendent, chief inspec¬
tor, inspector, sergeant and constable. The chief officer in the Metropolitan
Police area (the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis) is assisted by a
deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners. Next in rank are
deputy assistant commissioners, and then commanders; from chief superin¬
tendent the ranks are the same as in the regions. In the City of London the
ranks are the same as in the regions except that the chief officer is the
Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an assistant commis¬
sioner. Police ranks in Northern Ireland are similar to those in the rest of the
United Kingdom.
Cadet training is designed to prepare young people between 16 and 182 years
of age for a police service career. Cadets have no police powers but, in addition
to their educational studies and physical training, they are instructed in
elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for opera¬
tional duties, police authorities employ some 25,500 civilians on administrative
and technical duties.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are over 4,800) discharge specified duties
normally undertaken by the police. They may be authorised to issue fixed
penalty notices for some minor traffic offences1; to man police car pounds
(except in Scotland and Northern Ireland); to enforce some aspects of the
vehicle excise laws; and to obtain the names and addresses of people thought
to have committed certain types of traffic offence. They may also be employed
to direct traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and
as school-crossing patrols. Wardens are under the control of the chief
constable.
Each force has an attachment of special constables who volunteer to perform
1 A fixed penalty notice gives the recipient the option of paying a specified sum to the clerk of the
appropriate court instead of having his case tried in the ordinary way. A government review of
some aspects of traffic law, including the issue of fixed penalties, is in progress.

police duties without pay in their spare time. In England and Wales they act as
auxiliaries to the regular force when required. In Scotland they are used only in
emergencies although they may be assigned to duty for training. In Northern
Ireland there is a part-time and full-time reserve which is paid.
A police officer in Britain is an independent holder of an appointment under
the Crown, an agent of the law of the land, not of the police authority nor of the
Government, and may be sued or prosecuted for any wrongful act committed
in carrying out police duties. Strict procedures, normally including an inde¬
pendent element, govern the way in which complaints against police officers
are handled.
Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, however,
have their own staff associations which can make representations to ministers
or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or street
patrolling and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal investigation and
the arrest of offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police officers often
have to deal with social problems and they can bring in other social agencies
and expert help. In England and Wales they also prosecute accused people
and may decide whether or not to grant bail before the court proceedings
(see p 108).
The main departments in all forces are the uniform department, criminal
investigation department, traffic department and specialised departments,
including river or marine police, mounted police, and dog handlers.
A number of common services are provided by the central government
departments and by arrangements made between forces. The most important
of these are: training services; a Forensic Science Service in England and
Wales (the Metropolitan Police maintains its own laboratory); telecommunica¬
tions services which supply and maintain police radio equipment; and central
and provincial criminal records which are available to all forces. Regional
crime squad teams of experienced detectives from several forces investigate
major crimes involving inquiries in more than one police area. The Scottish
Crime Squad assists forces in the investigation and prevention of crime.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal
Police Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the
Metropolitan Police Force. The services of the Force are available, on request,
to help any other police force in England and Wales in criminal investigation,
as are the services of the Fraud Squad, which is run jointly by the Metropolitan
Police and the City of London Police for investigating company frauds.
Research into technical services is organised in separate units within the
Home Office Police Department: the Forensic Science Service and a Central
Research Establishment staffed by scientists; and a Directorate of Telecom¬
munications with one section of engineers engaged solely on research and
development. The Police Scientific Development Branch is staffed by scien¬
tists and technicians assisted by police officers seconded from the Police
Research Services Unit; both the Branch and the Unit are concerned with
operational research into police methods and the development of equipment
for police forces.
In all aspects of police work the use of scientific aids is widespread. A
national police computer has been developed to rationalise the keeping of
records and so speed up the dissemination of information.

Powers of
Arrest
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales arrest may be made either on a warrant issued by a
magistrate or without a warrant. An arrested person is entitled to ask the police
to notify a named person, such as a relative or a solicitor, about his (or her)
arrest. The police may delay notification if they think it necessary in the
interests of the investigation, the prevention of crime or the apprehension
of offenders. When a person has been arrested the police may question him or
her while in custody, so long as he or she has not been charged with the offence
and has been informed that he or she may be prosecuted for it. Evidence of
answers given to such questions is, in principle, admissible in any subsequent
proceedings against the person concerned, provided it has been given
voluntarily.
Guidance to the police on the manner in which they may question those
arrested is contained in the Judges’ Rules and Administrative Directions to the
Police; although these do not have the force of law, the police must comply
with them.
The Judges’ Rules also require the police to caution an arrested person
before charging him or her. Once a person has been charged with an offence,
the police may not put any further questions, except in exceptional circum¬
stances, to prevent or minimise harm or loss to some other person or to the
public or to clear up an ambiguity in a previous answer or statement.
If the police decide not to charge the arrested person (for example, because
of insufficient evidence to justify prosecution) he or she may be released
immediately. Alternatively, the police may decide to release the person and
proceed by way of summons, or to issue a caution (reprimand). If the police
need to make further inquiries they may release the arrested person on bail to
return to the police station, where he or she may be charged on re-appearance.
Anyone arrested without a warrant must be released by the police on bail if
he or she cannot be brought before a magistrates’ court within 24 hours, unless
the alleged offence is serious. If detained in custody, the defendant must be
brought before a magistrates’ court as soon as practicable. On appearance
before a magistrates’ court, a defendant charged with an imprisonable offence
may be refused bail in certain specified circumstances only, the most important
of these being that there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she
might abscond, commit further offences or otherwise interfere with the course
of justice. If bail is refused by the magistrates, the defendant can apply to a
judge of the High Court and, if committed to the Crown Court, may apply for
bail to that court. In 1979 nearly 80 per cent of people committed for trial by
magistrates were given bail.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for detention are
unlawful1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him or her, this person being required to appear before the court on
the day named to justify the detention. An application for this writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or by
someone acting on his or her behalf. Similar procedures apply in Northern
Ireland.
In Scotland the police have powers of arrest similar to those of the police in
England and Wales. In Scotland, however, an arrest must be accompanied by a
criminal charge, and there is little scope for questioning an arrested person.
Although the Judges’ Rules do not apply, an arrested person must be cautioned
1 Detention is lawful in pursuance of criminal justice, for contempt of court or of either House of
Parliament and when expressly authorised by Parliament. It is also lawful in certain circumstances
in the case of people found to be mentally disordered.

before being charged. Thereafter only voluntary statements made by the
arrested person are used in evidence at the trial and the court will reject any
statements he or she made unless satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
Anyone arrested must be brought before a court with the least possible delay.
Where a prosecution on indictment is intended, the accused is brought before a
judge for judicial examination and may then be committed for trial or for
further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further
examination and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be freed on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, that court or the
police may grant bail. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be
granted at the discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary.
There is a right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the
refusal of bail, by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party
against the amount fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scot¬
land, but the High Court of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully
detained and trials must be brought to a conclusion within no drys of
commital to custody.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the
police and in Scotland with public prosecutors. In Northern Ireland there is a
Director of Public Prosecutions (see p no). In England and Wales (and very
exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal proceedings.
Police have powers to issue cautions (warnings in Scotland) instead of
prosecuting, especially in the case of young people.
In England and Wales some offences can only be prosecuted by, or with the
consent of, the Attorney General, or the Director of Public Prosecutions, who
acts under the superintendence of the Attorney General. These offences
include crimes such as bribery and corruption of officials, and the use and
possession of explosives. Where the consent of the Attorney General is
required, the Director in practice prosecutes the case.
The Director always prosecutes crimes such as treason and murder. The
police must report to the Director’s office a further list of offences, including
serious offences against the person, sedition, criminal offences by police
officers, and offences relating to obscene or indecent publications. The Direc¬
tor does not necessarily prosecute all such cases referred but may do so in any
that appear to be important or where intervention is thought to be necessary;
otherwise proceedings are conducted by solicitors employed by the police. The
Director also considers whether proceedings should be taken in cases reported
by government departments, and advises the police and others concerned with
administration of the criminal law.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the Director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these are
drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel’ appointed by the Attorney General.
The prosecution process in Scotland is different from that in the rest of the
United Kingdom. The Lord Advocate (see p 126) is responsible for the
prosecution of all crimes but delegates most of the work to the Solicitor
General (see p 126), to ten advocates depute and to procurators fiscal. The
permanent adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown
Agent who is head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of
no

civil servants known as the Crown Office. Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by the Crown Office while crimes tried before the
sheriff and district courts are prosecuted by the procurators fiscal who are
lawyers and full-time civil servants. The police investigate offences known to
them and report to the procurator fiscal who decides whether or not to
prosecute, subject to the discretion and control of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment, and may
do so in summary cases of a serious nature. Other summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Magistrates’ courts deal with about 98 per cent of criminal cases in England and
Wales, and conduct preliminary investigations into the more serious offences.
The Crown Court, situated in a number of towns and cities, takes all criminal
work above the level of magistrates’ courts and trials are held before a jury.
Magistrates’ courts hear and determine charges against people accused of
‘summary offences’, that is those that can be legally disposed of by magistrates
sitting without a jury. There are some 700 courts and some 23,000 magistrates
(‘justices of the peace’, JPs) who are advised on points of law and procedure by
a clerk to the justices (or an assistant) who is normally legally qualified and is
also in charge of the court’s administrative arrangements. Each court normally
consists of a bench of three unpaid lay magistrates whose function is to
ascertain the facts of a case and apply the law to them. Magistrates are
appointed by the Lord Chancellor.
In inner London and some other large urban areas where work is heavy and
continuous there are also professional ‘stipendiary’ magistrates who are full¬
time, salaried and legally qualified. They usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a more serious case to see whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify committal for trial in the Crown Court the proceedings must not be
reported in the press at the time except at the defendant’s request, unless the
person is discharged by the magistrates.
Magistrates cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months’
imprisonment or a fine exceeding £1,000. If an offence carries a higher
maximum penalty, they may commit the offender for sentence at the Crown
Court if they consider their own power inadequate.
Cases involving people under the age of 17 are heard in juvenile courts.
These are specially constituted magistrates’ courts which sit either in a
different room or building from other courts, or at a different time; only
limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is charged
jointly with someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary magistrates’
court. If the young person is found guilty, that court may remit the case to a
juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case by penalty.
The Crown Court is responsible for trials of the more serious cases, the
sentencing of offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and
appeals from magistrates’ courts. It has about 90 centres and is presided over
by High Court judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All
contested trials in the court take place before a jury. A High Court judge sits
alone for the most serious cases. A circuit judge or recorder sits with between
two and four magistrates for appeals and committals for sentence from magis¬
trates’ courts and may sit with magistrates to try the less important cases.
The Crown Court may impose a fine of any amount on a convicted offender
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
III
Appeals
Scotland
and, within the maximum penalty determined for the offence by Parliament,
any other custodial or non-custodial penalty.
In 1979 the Crown Court tried 68,581 people; 41,000 pleaded guilty to at
least one charge and 25,150 not guilty to all charges. About one half of the
defendants pleading not guilty to all counts were acquitted.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court
against the sentence imposed and, if he or she has contested his or her guilt,
against the conviction itself. Where the appeal is on a point of law, either the
prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’ court to the High
Court, which sits in London and some regional centres (see pp 121-2).
Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or against sentence,
are usually made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A further appeal
from the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords can be brought if the court
certifies that a point of law of general public importance is involved and it
appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be
considered by the House. A prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the House
of Lords from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a
point of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is
acquitted; the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if
necessary. The acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity
of the acquitted person revealed without his or her consent.
There are three criminal courts: the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. The High Court tries serious crimes such as murder,
treason and rape while the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences
and the district court with minor offences.
Criminal cases are heard either under solemn procedure, when proceedings
are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury of 15 members, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure in the less
serious cases in the sheriff courts, and in all cases in the district courts.
A government committee is considering the effect on the criminal courts and
the prosecution system of the volume of minor offences dealt with by summary
prosecution and whether some other process could be devised to deal with such
offences while maintaining safeguards for accused people.
District courts are the administrative responsibility of the district and
islands local government authorities. The judges are lay justices of the peace
including up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands
authorities who may be nominated as ex officio justices. In Glasgow there are
three stipendiary magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
Scotland is divided into six sheriffdoms which are further divided into
sheriff court districts, each of which, depending on size, has a sheriff or
sheriffs, who are the judges of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both
a trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled to
try cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court),
the Lord Justice Clerk (the judge next in seniority) or one of the Lord
Commissioners of Justiciary who preside at sessions of the court in other
towns. The main seat of the court is in Edinburgh where all appeals are
heard.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sen¬
tence, or both. The High Court cannot order a retrial if it sets aside a
conviction. Appeals are heard by three or more judges; there is no further
appeal to the House of Lords.
Children under 16 years (and in some cases young people between 16 and 18)
who have committed an offence or are considered in need of compulsory care
may be brought before an informal children’s hearing comprising three mem¬
bers of the local community (see p 119).
The structure of the courts in Northern Ireland is broadly similar to that of
England and Wales. The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor
local cases is carried out by magistrates’ courts presided over by a full-time
resident magistrate appointed from the legal profession by the Queen, on the
recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Young offenders under 17 years and
young people under 17 who need care, protection and control are dealt with by
juvenile courts consisting of the resident magistrate and two lay members (at
least one of whom must be a woman) specially qualified to deal with juveniles.
Appeals from magistrates’ courts are dealt with by the county court.
The Crown Court in Northern Ireland deals with all trials on indictment of
criminal cases. It is divided into four circuits and is served by High Court and
county court judges. Proceedings in the Crown Court are heard before a single
judge, and all contested cases, other than those involving scheduled offences
under emergency legislation, take place before a jury.
Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or sentence, rest with
the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. Procedures for a further appeal to the
House of Lords are similar to those in operation in England and Wales.
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between
the prosecution and the defence. Since the criminal law presumes the inno¬
cence of an accused person until guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not
granted any advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the
right to employ a legal adviser and in certain circumstances may be granted
legal aid wholly or partly from public funds. If remanded in custody, the
person may be visited in prison by a legal adviser to ensure that a defence is
properly prepared. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland during the prep¬
aration of the case, the prosecution usually informs the defence of any relevant
documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and discloses them if
asked to do so. The prosecution should also inform the defence of any wit¬
nesses whose evidence may help the accused and whom the prosecution does
not propose to call. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the mental
state of the defendant renders him or her unfit to be tried. If the jury decides
that the defendant is unfit, he or she is admitted to a hospital specified by the
Home Secretary in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland to one
specified by a health and social services board.
Criminal trials in the United Kingdom are normally held in open court and
the rules of evidence (which are concerned with the proof of facts) are rigor¬
ously applied. If evidence is admitted in contravention of the law, a conviction
can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his or her lawyer) all the witnesses for the

prosecution; to call his or her own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either
in person or through a lawyer, the defence having the right to the last speech at
the trial. Moreover, the defendant cannot be questioned without consenting to
be sworn as a witness in his or her own defence. When he or she does testify,
cross-examination about character or other conduct may be made only in
exceptional circumstances and generally the prosecution may not introduce
evidence of such matters. Although confessions made in the course of previous
judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made on oath,
no confessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it can be
proved that they were made voluntarily.
In jury trials the judge determines questions of law, sums up the evidence for
the benefit of the jury, and discharges the accused or passes sentence. Only the
jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If the jury cannot
reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may direct it to bring in a majority verdict
provided that, in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two
dissentients. If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no
right of appeal against the verdict and the defendant cannot be tried again for
the same offence. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ the defendant has a right of appeal
to the appropriate court.
A jury is completely independent of the judiciary. Once members are sworn
in, they are protected from interference of any kind. Both the prosecution and
the defence can object to particular jurors. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland people whose names appear on the electoral register are liable for jury
service and their names are chosen at random; in Scotland, where the
minimum age for jurors is 21, not all those on the register are eligible to serve as
the minimum voting age is 18.
At summary trials in Scotland accused people are asked to plead to the charge
at the first calling of the case and, if they plead guilty, the court may dispose of
the case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or,
more usually, may appoint a later date.
In trials on indictment, the ‘pleading’ proceedings take place in the sheriff
court, where the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If
the plea is not guilty, the case is continued to the ‘trial’ proceedings in the
appropriate court. If the plea is guilty, and the case is to be dealt with in the
sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High Court case, it is
continued to the ‘trial’ proceedings in the High Court of Justiciary.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading proceed¬
ings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15. Evidence is
presented without opening speeches, and there are closing speeches for the
prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury.
The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which
result in acquittal, or it may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court
proceeds to deliver sentence. The verdict may be reached by a simple majority.
With a few minor exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence
of at least two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circum¬
stances which clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
Most of the work of coroners’ courts involves the investigation of violent and
unnatural deaths or sudden deaths where the cause is unknown. Cases may
be brought before the local coroner (a senior lawyer or doctor appointed by

local government) by doctors, the police, various public authorities or
members of the public, and it is the coroner’s duty to hold an inquiry into how,
when and where the deceased died. If the death is a sudden one of which the
cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest in court, but may
order a post-mortem examination to determine cause of death. Where there
is reason to believe that the deceased died a violent or unnatural death or
died in prison or in other specified circumstances the coroner must hold an
inquest.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the findings to the Crown Agent.
Coroners in Northern Ireland are mostly senior lawyers and are appointed
by the Lord Chancellor; the work of their courts is similar to that of coroners’
courts in England and Wales.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces and
in certain circumstances over their dependants and other civilians who accom¬
pany them overseas. The courts do not deal with certain serious offences if
committed in the United Kingdom, such as treason, murder, manslaughter,
and rape; these are dealt with in the ordinary courts.
While custodial treatment is an important part of British penal practice, it is
only one of several ways of dealing with people who break the law.
The criminal courts’ discretion in selecting the most appropriate sentence for
an offender is modified by statutory provisions designed to ensure that prison
sentences are kept to a minimum. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a
person who has not previously served a custodial sentence of a particular kind
may not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind unless he or she is
legally represented or has chosen not to be, and unless the court is satisfied that
no other sentence will suffice. In England and Wales, extended sentences
longer than the normal maximum term may be imposed on persistent offen¬
ders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment.
This is the maximum penalty for a number of serious offences such as robbery,
rape, arson and manslaughter. Although the death penalty may still, in theory,
be imposed for certain offences, such as treason, it has in practice fallen into
disuse for offences committed in peace-time.
In Scotland, unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty
is determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on
indictment, the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any
term up to life, and the Sheriff Court any term up to two years. In summary
cases, the sheriff may impose up to six months’ imprisonment.
Non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute or (in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three years (one
year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made when the court considers
there is no need to impose punishment on a convicted person; and ‘binding
over’ where the offender is required to pledge money, with or without sureties,
to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
In England and Wales, offenders aged 17 or over convicted of imprisonable
offences can, with their consent, be given community service orders. The
court may order between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service to be completed
within 12 months. Examples of work done include decorating the houses of old
Probation
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 115
or disabled people and building adventure playgrounds for children. Com¬
munity service schemes have begun in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The sentence imposed on an offender in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland may also, with his or her consent, be deferred for up to six months to
enable a court to arrive at the most appropriate sentence, taking into account
conduct after some expected change in circumstances.
The courts may order a convicted offender to pay compensation for any
personal injury, loss or damage resulting from an offence. In cases where the
loss amounts to £15,000 or more they may make a criminal bankruptcy order
against an offender. In Scotland a committee has reported to the Secretary of
State and the Lord Advocate on the potential role of the criminal court in
ordering reparation by the offender to the victim.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served by the offender
unless he or she is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprison¬
ment; in that event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another
sentence may be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a sus¬
pended sentence of more than six months may be placed under the supervision
of a probation officer for all or part of the period. The Criminal Law Act 1977
provided the courts in England and Wales with power, when passing a sentence
of between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment, to order that part should
be served and the rest held in suspense, the suspended part being not less than
one quarter nor more than three quarters of the whole. This provision has not
yet, however, been brought into force.
In certain circumstances courts may order forfeiture of property involved in
the commission of crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime may be
disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, after a rehabilitation period of from six months to
ten years depending on the nature of the sentence imposed, a person convicted
of a criminal offence need not disclose it, and the offence will not be held
against him or her. This does not apply to those who have received a prison
sentence of more than 25 years.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender, who continues
to live an ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer whose duty
is to advise, assist and befriend the probationer. Before making a probation
order (which lasts between six months and three years), the court must explain
its effects and make sure that the probationer understands that failure to
comply with its requirements will make him or her liable to be dealt with again
for the original offence. An order can be made only if the offender is aged 17
years or over and has given his or her consent. The order usually requires the
probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation officer, to be of good
behaviour and lead a responsible life. In Northern Ireland an order can be
made for anyone over the age of criminal responsibility (10 years), but consent
is required where the offender is aged 14 or over. It may also require the
offender to live in a specified place (such as an approved hostel), or in certain
circumstances, receive psychiatric treatment.
In England and Wales the probation service is administered locally by
probation and after-care committees consisting of local magistrates and co¬
opted members with legal and specialist interests. In Northern Ireland it is
administered by the Northern Ireland Office. Probation officers are usually
members of small teams, although each has a large measure of independence in
his or her casework with an offender.
Il6 BRITAIN ig8i: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days), bail hostels, probation hostels and other
establishments for use in the rehabilitation of offenders. The service is also
responsible for administering the community service scheme.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court. In Scotland, offenders
subject to probation orders or to after-care supervision are supervised by
specially approved local authority social workers.
Prisons Although the courts have made proportionately less use of prison as a penalty
for criminal activity, there has been an increase in the prison population as a
result of the rise in crime. In 1979 the daily average number of people in
prisons, borstals, and detention centres was about 42,200 in England and
Wales and 4,580 in Scotland; there are 115 prison service establishments and
the size of the prison service in 1979 was 22,300. Policies announced in 1980,
based on the report of a committee of inquiry, include the continuation of
efforts to reduce the prison population and plans to increase the building
programme, the reorganisation of prison service administration, and the
appointment of a Chief Inspector of Prisons, separate from the Prison
Department.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known
as ‘local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be
open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons (open prisons
do not have physical barriers to prevent escape). Sentenced prisoners are
classified into four groups for the purposes of security. There are separate
prisons for women.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Prisoners under 21 are separated from older prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are
unsatisfactory by modern standards. Overcrowding is also a problem. How¬
ever, a number of new prisons have been built in the past few years, and
existing establishments are being redeveloped and modernised.
Remission of All prisoners in Great Britain serving a determinate sentence of more than one
Sentence and month, except those sentenced to imprisonment for life, are allowed remission
Parole of one-third of their sentence provided that this does not reduce the sentence to
less than 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission may be forfeited for serious
misconduct in prison. Prisoners serving fixed sentences of more than 18
months become eligible for consideration for release on parole after serving
one-third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever expires later.
The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the prisoner
would have been released but for the parole. It prescribes the conditions with
which the offender must comply when on parole. About 8-8 per cent of
prisoners granted parole in England and Wales in 1979 were recalled to prison.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consideration by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland
who consults the judiciary, and on the recommendation of the Parole Board.
Those released in this way remain on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall at any time should the circumstances warrant.
In Northern Ireland, where there is no parole scheme, prisoners receive
one-half remission on determinate sentences, provided that remission does not

reduce the sentence to below 31 days. For those serving over a year, a court can
order all or part of the outstanding balance of the remitted period to be served
in the event of reconviction in the remitted period for an imprisonable offence,
in addition to any penalty imposed for a further offence.
Prison industries aim both to give inmates work experience which will assist
them when released and to secure an economic return which will reduce the
cost of the prison system to public funds. The main industries are clothing and
textile manufacture, engineering, woodwork, laundering, electro-mechanical
production, farming and horticulture. Most production caters for internal
needs and for other public services but a considerable volume is for the
commercial market. A few prisoners are employed outside prison. Small
payments are made to inmates for the work they do; in some prisons, incentive
schemes provide an opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and
skill.
Education for those in custody is financed by the prison service and provided
by the local education authorities. Every prison department establishment in
England and Wales has an education officer assisted by a team of full-time and
part-time teachers. Education is compulsory, full-time, for young offenders
below school leaving age and part-time for those between 16 and 21. For all
older offenders it is voluntary. Some prisoners study for public examinations
(including those of the Open University). Within the resources available there
is teaching in recreational and leisure pursuits. Vocational training is provided
directly by the prison service. Similar opportunities for education and voca¬
tional training are available in Northern Ireland prisons.
Physical education is voluntary but offenders under 21 have to attend a
certain number of classes. Many establishments lack the proper facilities,
although there have been recent improvements.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation
for sick people and there are some larger prison hospitals (some with up to 100
beds) to which patients can be transferred if necessary. Four prisons have
surgical units and patients can also be transferred to hospitals within the
National Health Service. Psychiatric care is available to all prisoners who need
it and there is one specialist psychiatric prison.
The work of psychologists varies from place to place but includes evaluating
treatment programmes, studying management practices, contributing to the
management and treatment programmes of individuals and groups, taking part
in advisory and training work with prison staff and making assessmen .s for
treatment or allocation purposes.
All prisoners have a general entitlement to write and receive letters and to be
visited by their relatives at regular intervals. Privileges include a personal
radio, books, periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases
from the canteen with money earned in prison. Depending on the facilities
available, prisoners may be granted the further privileges of dining and recrea¬
tion in association and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the board
of visitors (visiting committee in Scotland), who have power to order, among
other penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges. Boards of

visitors (and visiting committees) consist of lay people, two of whom must be
magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the general concern of all the prison staff. Much of
this work is the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers)
stationed in prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals
and agencies outside and make plans for after-care on release. Prisoners may
also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors whose work is
voluntary.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life. A
chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland of the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church),
a Roman Catholic priest and a Methodist minister are appointed to every
prison. Ministers of other denominations are appointed or called in as needed.
All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release preparations for prison¬
ers. Those serving sentences of four years or more are considered for outside
employment for a period before release. If selected, work is found outside the
prison for about the last six months of sentence; during the period prisoners
may live in a separate part of the prison or in a hostel outside. Normal wages are
paid so that they can resume support for their families. In Scotland pre-release
arrangements differ from these in some respects.
Periods of home leave may be granted in the last nine months of sentence to
those serving two years or more to assist resettlement.
The aim of after-care, run by the probation and after-care service, is to assist
offenders on return to society by offering them the help of skilled case workers.
Compulsory supervision by probation officers is given to most offenders under
21 when released, adult offenders released on parole, and those released on
licence from a sentence of life imprisonment. A voluntary system is offered to
the remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of voluntary societies,
most of which are members of the National Association for the Care and
Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and other forms of accommodation are
provided, often with some financial help from the Home Office.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of an offence.
A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an offence may be
the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings, both of which are
normally held before juvenile courts (see p no).
In care proceedings the fact that a child is found guilty of an offence is not in
itself sufficient justification for the making of an order; the court must also
consider the child to be in need of care or control which he or she is unlikely to
receive unless an order is made. In criminal proceedings a court may make a
care order without having to consider whether the child is in need of care or
control; this applies to a child found guilty of an offence (other than homicide)
punishable in the case of an adult by imprisonment.
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal
proceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority,
which becomes responsible for deciding where the child should be accommo¬
dated, whether, for example, with foster parents or in a community home (see
p 142). The Government is reviewing this procedure, and intends to give the
courts powers to make a residential care order in criminal proceedings. The
Scotland
Northern Ireland
JUSTICE AND THE LAW Iig
authority must review each care order every six months and consider whether
an application should be made to the court to have the order ended; the order
normally expires when the child reaches 18 or 19. For children who are too
severely disturbed or disruptive to be treated in other child care homes, ‘youth
treatment centres’ are provided by the Department of Health and Social
Security.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer, but may be required to live with a specified
person or to comply with specified directions of his or her supervisor. The
child may have to undergo ‘intermediate treatment’, a compromise between
measures involving complete removal from home and those which do not, and
consisting of participation, under a supervisor, in a variety of constructive and
remedial activities through a short residential course or, more usually, attend¬
ance at a day or evening centre. An intermediate treatment fund, administered
by the Rainer Foundation with the help of government finance, has been set up
to give grants to individuals, groups or organisations willing to provide inter¬
mediate treatment facilities.
A court may also make an order requiring a parent or guardian to agree to
take proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him or her;
such an order may only be made with the consent of the parent or guardian. In
care proceedings, the court may order a stay in hospital in accordance with the
mental health legislation.
The courts may also order payments of compensation, or impose fines or
grant a conditional or absolute discharge. Offenders, both male and female,
may be ordered to spend a total of up to 24 hours of their spare time on
Saturdays at an attendance centre (up to three hours on any one occasion). The
centres which provide physical training and instruction in handicrafts or some
other practical subject are for those found guilty of offences for which older
people could be sent to prison. Boys aged 14 to 16 may be sent to a junior
detention centre, where the regime is similar to that in senior detention centres
(see p 120). Boys and girls aged 15 or 16 may be committed to the Crown Court
for a sentence of borstal training. In the case of a very serious crime, the Crown
Court may order detention in a place approved by the Home Secretary.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children in the criminal courts is rare and can take place only on the instruc¬
tions of the Lord Advocate; court proceedings usually apply only to very
serious offences such as murder or assault. Instead children under 16 years
who have committed an offence or need care and protection may be brought
before an informal children’s hearing which decides the most appropriate
measures of care and treatment (see p 142). An official ‘reporter’ decides
whether a child should come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are
not accepted by the child and parents, the case goes to the sheriff court (sitting
in its civil capacity) for proof. It can then come back to the hearing. The sheriff
also decides appeals against a decision of a children’s hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children aged 16
and under charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought before a
juvenile court. If the child is found guilty of an offence punishable by imprison¬
ment if committed by an adult, he or she may be sent to a training school,
placed in the care of a ‘fit person’, possibly the area Health and Social Services
Board or under supervision. Alternatively the court can order a period of
120

attendance at an attendance centre or a remand home, or impose a fine or
compensation. A conditional or absolute discharge is also possible. Whatever
other order it makes, a juvenile court can also make an order requiring parents
ensure the child’s good behaviour. Young people aged 16 or over may be given
a sentence of borstal training. Children brought before the courts in need of
care and protection may be placed in care locally. The law relating to young
offenders and the care of children is under review.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years (16 to 21 years in Scotland) are recognised as a
category distinct from child and adult offenders. The main non-custodial
measures are generally the same as those used in dealing with adults. In
England and Wales the custodial sentences available are: detention in a deten¬
tion centre (males only), borstal training or imprisonment and, in Northern
Ireland, detention in a young offenders’ centre. Some 11 senior detention
centres provide a means of treating young male offenders (age 17-21) for
whom a long period of residential training away from home does not seem
necessary or justified by the offence, but who need to be taught respect for the
law through some form of custody. The normal period of detention is three
months but there is power to award up to six months. Life in a centre demands
high standards of discipline. Training comprises a normal working week of 40
hours, including an hour each day of physical training, with considerable
attention paid to education. After discharge, offenders are supervised for up to
a year. A pilot project involving more rigorous regimes is in progress at one
junior and one senior detention centre in England.
Borstal training is remedial and educational, based on personal training by
carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled
trades. There is much freedom of movement and many borstals are open
establishments. Offenders are placed as near their homes as possible in
order to maintain their ties with the local community. Borstals are avail¬
able for offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16 to 20 years in Northern Ireland).
Courts rarely order borstal training unless they have already tried fines,
probation or detention centre training, perhaps all three. The training period
usually ranges from six months to two years and is followed by supervision in
the community.
A person under 17 years cannot be sent to prison in England and Wales, and
no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender aged 17 to 20
years unless satisfied that no other penalty is appropriate. A court cannot
impose a sentence of between six months and three years unless the offender
has already served a term of borstal training or at least six months’ imprison¬
ment. Sentences of up to two years may be ordered by a court to be suspended.
Prisoners under the age of 21 at the time of sentence are classified as ‘young
prisoners’, and generally serve their sentences separately from older prisoners
unless they are reclassified as adults and treated as such in an adult prison. In
Scotland no offender under 21 years may be sent to prison. A single sentence of
detention is available for young offenders. This is served in a detention centre
if the sentence is between 28 days and 4 months, and in a young offenders’
institute if otherwise. Remission of part of the sentence for good conduct,
release on parole, and supervision in the community after release are available.
In Northern Ireland, no offender under 21 who has been sentenced to three
years or less may be sent to prison. Where borstal is not suitable, detention in a
young offenders’ centre may be ordered for those aged 17 and over, and,
exceptionally, for 16 year olds.
Custodial sentences for young adult offenders in England and Wales are

under review. The Government has announced its intention of amending the
legislation which limits the courts’ power to sentence young offenders.
CIVIL JUSTICE
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern
Ireland are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of
torts (covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespec¬
tive of any contract between them and including concepts such as negligence,
defamation and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitu¬
tional and administrative law (particularly concerned with the use of executive
power), industrial law, maritime law and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law
has its own, often analogous, branches.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affilia¬
tion and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction concerning
nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates. Committees
of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers actions founded upon
contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount claimed is not
more than £2,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount does not exceed
£15,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net annual value for
rating does not exceed £2,000. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the
county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circumstances be
transferred from the High Court to the county court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Acts, landlord and tenant and adoption cases. In addition, undefended
divorce cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court) and outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also
deal with complaints of race and sex discrimination in education and the
provision of goods, facilities, services and premises (see p 152). Where small
claims are concerned (especially those for less than £200 involving consumers),
there are special facilities for arbitration and simplified procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court
are mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the
request of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a
jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the
Queen’s Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is
both original and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is
vested in all its divisions. In general, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division. The Family Division, for instance, is concerned with all
jurisdiction affecting the family, including that relating to adoption and guar¬
dianship of children. The Chancery Division deals with the interpretation of
wills and the administration of estates. (Its work is under review.) Maritime
and commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial courts of
the Queen’s Bench Division.
There are 75 High Court judges, each of whom is attached to one division on

appointment but may be transferred to any other division while in office. The
Lord Chancellor is president of the Chancery Division, the administration of
which is the responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor.
The Queen’s Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of
England, who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the
Family Division is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High
Court sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings are held at 23 Crown Court
centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit alone.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appro¬
priate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and guardianship proceedings heard by
magistrates’ courts go to a divisional court of the Family Division of the
High Court. Affiliation appeals are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals
from decisions of the licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the
High Court and the county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil
Division) and may go on to the House of Lords, the final court of appeal in civil
cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 18 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president
of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings
take the form of the normal proceedings of the House; judgments are given in
the form of speeches to a motion, and the decision is in the form of a vote.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and
is normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the
sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal
or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and subject to a few exceptions
has jurisdiction to deal with all kinds of action. The main exception is an action
exclusive to the sheriff court, namely one where the value claimed is less than
£500. The Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other
actions. The court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first
instance, and the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner
House is divided into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four
judges—the first division being presided over by the Lord President and the
second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be
made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House
an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the Court of Session are
the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord President of the
Court holds the office of Lord Justice General in the High Court (see pin).
The Scottish
Land Court
The Scottish Land Court is a special court whose jurisdiction relates to
agricultural tenancies and similar matters. It consists of a judge (ranking
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
123

Civil
Proceedings
equally with the judges of the Court of Session) and four laymen who are
specialists in agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland where the amount in dispute is less than
£2,000 are dealt with in county courts, though magistrates’ courts also deal
with certain classes of minor civil cases. The superior civil law court is the High
Court of Justice from which an appeal may be made to the Court of Appeal.
These two courts, together with the Crown Court, comprise the Supreme
Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland and their practice and procedure are
similar to those in the corresponding English courts. The House of Lords is the
final civil appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry on the authenticity of the grievance is required. An
action in a magistrates’ court is begun by a complaint on which the court may
serve the defendant with a summons. This contains details of the complaint
and the date on which it will be heard by the court. The parties and any
witnesses give their evidence at the court hearing. Domestic proceedings are
heard by not more than three lay justices including, where practicable, a
woman justice; members of the public are not allowed to be present. The court
may make an order containing provision for the custody and supervision of
children, as well as for maintenance payments for spouses and children.
Actions in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on
the defendant by the plaintiff, notifying the defendant that the plaintiff has a
claim and stating its nature. If the defendant intends to contest the claim he or
she informs the court. Documents setting out the precise question in dispute
(the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County court proceedings are
initiated by a ‘request’ served on the defendant by the court; subsequent
procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but a special
procedure extending to most undefended cases dispenses with the need to give
evidence in court and permits written evidence to be considered by the
registrar.
Civil proceedings, because they are a private matter, can usually be aban¬
doned or compromised at any time without the court’s permission, the parties
to a dispute being able to settle their differences through their solicitors before
the actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually tried by
a judge without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defamation, false
imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, when either party may insist on trial
by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the person against whom fraud is alleged
may claim this right. The jury decides questions of fact and damages awarded
to the injured party; majority verdicts may be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restrain¬
ing someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey a judgment
ordering the defendant to do something or to refrain from doing something
may result in imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of
committal may be effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (barristers’ fees, solicitors’
charges, court fees and other payments) are within the discretion of the court.

BRITAIN ig8i: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Normally, the court orders them to be paid by the party losing the action, but
in the case of family law maintenance proceedings a magistrates’ court has
discretion, whatever its judgment, to order either party to pay the whole or part
of the other’s costs.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a
value exceeding £500) in the sheriff court are initiated by serving the defender
with a summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session
actions the next step is the publication of the action in the court lists.
A defender who intends to contest the action must inform the court; if he or
she does not appear, the court grants a decree in absence in favour of the
pursuer. In ordinary actions in the sheriff court the defender is simply required
to enter appearance within a certain number of days after service of the initial
writ, and this is followed by a formal appearance in court by the parties to the
dispute or their solicitors.
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than £500) in the sheriff
court the procedure is less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in
the summons (a printed form obtained from the sheriff clerk). The procedure
is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the parties
involved having to appear in court. Normally they (or their representatives)
need appear only when an action is defended. Proceedings in Northern Ireland
are similar to those in England and Wales.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five judges
and up to ten other people with experience and expertise in industry, com¬
merce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial func¬
tions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule, they are set up
under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions and
procedure. Their composition and procedures vary greatly. Compared with
the courts, they are regarded as less expensive, less formal and more accessible;
they also have expert knowledge of their particular subjects. The expansion of
the tribunal system is comparatively recent, most tribunals having been set up
since 1945. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and
obligations of private citizens towards each other or towards a government
department or other public authority. A number of important tribunals
(notably the rent and the industrial tribunals) decide disputes between private
citizens. Some (such as those concerned with social security) resolve claims by
private citizens against public authorities. A further group (including tax
tribunals) decide disputed claims by public authorities against private citizens,
and still others decide issues in dispute which do not directly affect financial
rights or liabilities, such as entitlement to licences or the right to enter the
United Kingdom, or issues of personal liberty, for example, those decided by
mental health review tribunals. Tribunals usually consist of an uneven number
of people so that a majority decision can be reached; some consist of one person
sitting alone. Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with
the subject but other authorities (for instance, the Lord Chancellor) have the
power of appointment in appropriate cases. The Lord Chancellor (or the Lord
President of the Court of Session in Scotland) makes appointments in most
cases where a lawyer chairman or member is required. Members usually hold
office for a specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSI¬
BILITIES
England and
Wales
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 125
of doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from
the statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be made
in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of Session
and in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. An appeal may also be made to
a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown or to an
independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribund, which hears appeals
on questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals (see p 338), has High
Court and Court of Session status. The Council on Tribunals (appointed
jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate) exercises general
supervision over tribunals, advising on draft rules of procedure, monitoring
their activities and reporting on particular matters; those peculiar to Scotland
are dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government
and is not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of
justice. Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord
Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister who recommends the
highest judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords); he is concerned with court procedure, is responsible
for the administration of all courts other than magistrates’ courts, appoints
magistrates, and has general responsibility for the legal aid and advice scheme.
He is also responsible for the administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons and the probation and after-care service. A
general supervision over magistrates’ courts is also held with some specific
responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks). On
matters relating to crime prevention and the treatment of offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by the Advisory Council on the Penal System. Prison
policy and the administration of custodial centres are functions of the Home
Office Prison Department, and the Home Secretary appoints to each centre a
board of visitors representing the local community to investigate and advise on
the state of prison premises, administration and treatment of inmates. The
boards have certain disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of
discipline and they hear applications or complaints from inmates. The Home
Secretary is advised by a special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on
licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under the age of 17 is shared
between the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security.
The Home Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to grant a free pardon to a person
convicted of a crime or to cancel all or part of a penalty imposed on an offender
by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing
accommodation for all the superior courts in England and Wales, except the
Central Criminal Court, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General (the Law Officers of the
Crown for England and Wales) are the Government’s principal advisers on

English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and interna¬
tional cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of
Commons and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney
General for Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
final responsibility for enforcing the criminal law; the Director of Public
Prosecutions (see p 109) is subject to the Attorney General’s superintendence.
The Attorney General is concerned with instituting and prosecuting certain
types of criminal proceedings, but must exercise an independent discretion,
and must not be influenced by government colleagues. The Solicitor General
is, in effect, the deputy of the Attorney General.
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,
staffing and organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local authorities. The Secretary of
State is also responsible for crime prevention, and the police and the penal
system, and is advised on parole matters by the Parole Board for Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal represen¬
tatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord
Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administration
and is also responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and for the
public prosecution of all major crimes (see p 109).
In Northern Ireland the judiciary is appointed by the Queen on the advice of
the Lord Chancellor. The administration of all courts is the responsibility of
the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary
of State, deals with the police and the penal system.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts since the Crown is
the historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor, who
is head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet minister.
With the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from
practising barristers (advocates in Scotland) or solicitors. Lay magistrates in
England and Wales need no legal qualifications but on appointment they
undergo a period of basic training, to give them sufficient knowledge of the
law, including the rules of evidence, and to enable them to understand the
nature and purpose of sentencing. A special committee advises the Lord
Chancellor on training policies. The Scottish district court justices of the peace
likewise need no legal qualifications, and the Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for training. In Northern Ireland lay magistrates serving on
juvenile courts undertake training courses; resident magistrates are drawn
from practising solicitors or barristers. In certain circumstances (for instance,
in cases of misconduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland may be removed from their positions by
the Lord Chancellor, and in Scotland, by the Secretary of State on a report by
the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from
The Legal
Profession
JUSTICE AND THE LAW I2y
the executive, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern Ireland
(other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet minister, changes with the
Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the Sovereign on an
address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there is no
statutory provision for removing of judges of the Court of Session or High
Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would
be needed to secure such a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business
for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher courts; certain functions, however,
are common to both. Although people are free to conduct their own cases, most
people prefer to be legally represented in the more serious court cases.
A Royal Commission reported in 1979 on the provision of legal services in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A similar Commission, inquiring into
legal services in Scotland, reported in May 1980 (see Bibliography).
In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a
barrister must be a member of one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn,
Inner Temple, Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn). To become a student
member of an Inn, an entrant must normally have a law degree from a United
Kingdom university or polytechnic. People with other degrees and ‘mature’
students may also be accepted, but they must pass a diploma in law. All
students must pass the professional examinations run by the Council of Legal
Education. After training, a student can be called to the Bar, but may not
practise independently until a year’s pupillage with an established barrister has
been completed. The governing body of the profession is the Senate of the Inns
of Court and the Bar. The Bar Council (composed of members of the Senate
elected by the Bar) maintains the standards and independence of the profession
and improves its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the Council of the Law Society (the professional organisation of solicitors) and
must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less than
five years’ standing before beginning a professional career. The term of articles
lasts from two to four years, depending on the educational qualifications of the
student. An articled clerk must pass the necessary examinations prescribed by
the Law Society and, with very few exceptions, is required to attend a course of
studies at a recognised law school. Once qualified, a solicitor may become a
member of the Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo similar training.
While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of Advocates and
the Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional examinations,
candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including the necessary
subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective advocate
must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months or of 12
months depending on whether or not exemption from nine months’ training
has been granted) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine months’
pupillage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must serve an
apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before beginning a profes¬
sional career.
In Northern Ireland most students wishing to become solicitors or barristers
must, after attaining a law degree, undertake a period of study at the Institute

Barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland; there is also a
General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The professional organisation
for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland.
Assistance from funds provided by the State is available to a person requiring
help in meeting the cost of legal advice and representation in court proceed¬
ings. The State is entitled to be reimbursed from contributions which assisted
people may have to pay according to their means and costs, and from money or
property recovered from legally aided people’s opponents in litigation, or
awarded by the court.
Where court proceedings are not involved, people with moderate means can
obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter either free or subject to a
contribution. This includes giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills and
obtaining opinions from a barrister. A solicitor may act for a client until costs
and expenses reach a total of £25 (£55 f°r divorce or judicial separation cases),
but authority must be obtained for this limit to be exceeded. The legal advice
and assistance scheme is also used for representation by a solicitor in certain
civil proceedings in magistrates’ courts. A person seeking help must give the
solicitor brief details about income and savings. The income limit laid down by
the scheme is reviewed at least once a year.
In a number of deprived urban areas law centres provide free legal advice
to people of limited means who might not otherwise obtain it. All law
centres, which are voluntary organisations financed from various sources,
including government grants, have at least one full-time salaried lawyer and
many employ community workers. Most centres devote the largest proportion
of their time to tenant-landlord disputes and other housing problems. Free
legal advice is also available in many Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer and
housing advice centres and in specialist advice centres run by various voluntary
organisations.
Legal aid for civil proceedings is available to people whose disposable incomes
and capital fall below certain prescribed amounts, but a contribution is payable
according to the level of the applicant’s income; if that is below a prescribed
amount, legal aid is given free. As in the case of legal advice and assistance, the
qualifying income limits are reviewed at least once a year.
An applicant for legal aid must also show reasonable grounds for taking or
defending the proceedings. If the application is successful the case is then
conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes between the
assisted person and the solicitor—payments being made in and out of the legal
aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses against an
unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if the court so
orders, be met out of the fund. Solicitors and counsel must review the case at
each stage to see that it is not being pursued unreasonably at public expense.
Legal aid is not generally available in cases where redress is sought for alleged
defamation or for representation in most proceedings in administrative tribun¬
als.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by the Law Society, the Law Society of
Scotland and the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State
for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Aid in
Criminal
Proceedings
LAW REFORM
129
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant needs financial help in meeting the costs of the proceedings. An
order must be made when a person is committed for trial on a charge of murder
or where the prosecutor appeals or applies for leave to appeal from the Court of
Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Court Martial Appeal Court to the House of
Lords. No person who is unrepresented can be given a custodial sentence for
the first time unless given the opportunity to apply for legal aid.
Voluntary duty solicitor schemes at many magistrates’ courts provide
‘standby’ help for unrepresented defendants.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Lord Chancellor.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and
the ‘interests of justice’ test applies only in summary cases.
The duty of keeping the law under review to ensure that it meets the needs of
modern society lies in England and Wales with the Law Reform Committee,
the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission, and in
Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform Committee
and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing committees of judges
and distinguished practising and academic lawyers, appointed respectively by
the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine aspects of the civil
and criminal law referred to them by the appropriate minister. The Criminal
Law Revision Committee has produced 14 reports; of the 12 recommending
legislation, ten have been wholly or partly enacted.
The Law Commission is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high
standing, responsible for scrutinising the law with a view to its systematic
development and reform, including the possibility of codification, elimination
of anomalies, repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments, and reduction of
the number of separate enactments. It reports to the Lord Chancellor. The
Scottish Law Commission, whose constitution and functions are similar to
those of the English body, reports to the Lord Advocate. The work of the two
commissions has produced changes in many areas of the law, the repeal of some
950 obsolete Acts and the pruning of the contents of nearly 1,400 others.
The Law Commission is also concerned with the reform in Northern Ireland
of those branches of the law which were outside the scope of the powers of
the former Parliament of Northern Ireland. Other aspects of law reform in
Northern Ireland are dealt with by the Office of Law Reform.
6 Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. Education is described in
Chapter 7, and housing in Chapter Q- The National Health Service provides
a comprehensive range of medical services which are available to all resi¬
dents, irrespective of means. The local authority personal social services and
voluntary organisations provide advice and help to elderly people, disabled
people and children in need of care. The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in financial need by providing
income during periods of inability to earn, help for families and compensa¬
tion for disablement.
Joint finance and planning between health and local authorities aims to
prevent overlapping of services and to encourage the development of com¬
munity services. In deciding their priorities, some local authorities attach
greater importance than others to the personal social services and to the various
categories of people in need of help, with the result that provision can vary
from area to area.
Central government is responsible directly for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local government authorities.
Spending on social welfare in 1979 was: health £8,863 million (5-4 per cent
of gross domestic product), personal social services £1,73 3 million (1 percent),
and social security £18,497 million (11-3 per cent). In spite of plans to reduce
public expenditure in the period to 1983-84, and to effect economies in local
authority services, social welfare spending will increase. Social security is by
far the largest public expenditure programme.
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service (NHS) is based upon the principle that there
should be a comprehensive range of publicly provided services designed to
promote improvement in the health of the people and in the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of illness. All taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members of the community who do not
require health care help to pay for those who do. At the time of use there may be
moderate charges (as for prescriptions and spectacles—though not for chil¬
dren and people with low incomes) or none at all (for example for hospital
care). Some 60 per cent of NHS expenditure goes on children, the elderly, the
disabled, and the mentally ill and handicapped.
Visitors to Britain are not entitled to use the NHS except where reciprocal
health agreements with their countries apply (see p 138). They may be allowed
free NHS treatment in certain emergencies. Visitors are expected to pay if the
purpose of their visit is to seek treatment.
How far the improvements in the nation’s health over the past 30 years or so
are attributable to the NHS is impossible to determine, but some changes have
SOCIAL WELFARE
I3I
been aided by the planning and provision of a national system of care; the
advances in maternal and child care, for example, the use of vaccines for the
benefit of all sections of the community, the more efficient use of acute hospital
services (for surgery, gynaecology and childbirth), and the establishment of
primary health care teams and health centres. Like health care systems in other
countries, the National Health Service has its problems, however. They range
from regional disparities in health provision to shortages of resources and
industrial relations difficulties. An additional problem is the high cost of
technologically advanced equipment required for diagnosis and treatment and
of such advanced surgery as heart transplantation.
The Government has announced its intention of improving the use of
available resources within the National Health Service and of simplifying its
organisation by removing the area health authority tier of its administrative
structure in England by April 1983. Proposals for simplifying administration
in Scotland and Wales have also been made. It also believes that there is a
bigger place for private medicine and that this should be facilitated and
encouraged. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service which
reported in 1979 (see Bibliography) recommended a greater emphasis in the
role of preventive medicine, measures to simplify the administration of the
Service, changes in internal financing methods, and a review of national
arrangements for negotiating pay and settling disputes.
ADMINISTRATION The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—are
responsible for all aspects of the health services in their respective areas.
Within each of the four parts of the country the health departments (the
Department of Health and Social Security in England, the Scottish Home and
Health Department, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and
Social Services in Northern Ireland) are responsible for strategic planning.
Area health authorities in England and Wales and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for planning and operational control of all health services in their
area. In England, because of its greater size and population, a tier of regional
authorities is responsible for regional planning and certain services best
administered on a regional basis (for example, research and major capital
building work).
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales, 15 health boards in Scotland and 4
health and social services boards in Northern Ireland. The authorities and
boards, which consist of unpaid, part-time members are statutory agencies of
central government and co-operate closely with local authorities responsible
for social work, environmental health, education and other services. In general
the areas covered by area health authorities and health boards correspond with
those of the major local authorities. Health and local authorities in England,
Wales and Scotland co-operate by means of joint planning arrangements and
joint consultative committees.
In Northern Ireland the four health and social services boards act as agents
for the Department of Health and Social Services, spanning both health and
personal social services.
The area authorities and health boards can determine the pattern of services
best suited to their areas but have to take account of national priorities. In most
areas the day-to-day running of services is carried out by management teams in
districts which usually contain a district general hospital and have a population
of between 200,000 and 500,000, though some are considerably larger (in
132
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they may be much smaller). In Scot¬
land a Common Services Agency organises certain central services; there are
similar agencies in Wales and Northern Ireland.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees at
national, regional and area level; the authorities have a duty to consult them.
There are also such advisory bodies as the Committee on Vaccination and
Immunisation, the Scottish Health Service Planning Council in Scotland and
the Health and Social Services Council in Northern Ireland. The Health
Advisory Service for England and Wales reports to the Secretaries of State on
conditions in hospitals and the community health service. The Scottish Hospi¬
tal Advisory Service reports to health boards and to the Secretary of State.
Public representation in the Service for England and Wales is provided by
community health councils. These consist of about 20 to 30 members, half of
them appointed by local government councils and the rest mainly on the
nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health services. They have
access to the area health authority, the right to secure information and the right
to visit hospitals. In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the
health boards to represent the interests of the public. District committees
exercise this function in Northern Ireland.
Health Service Legislation provides for the appointment of three Health Service Commis-
Commissioners sioners (for England, Scotland and Wales) to investigate complaints from
members of the public about the health service. All three posts are held by the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (see p 35), whose health
service jurisdiction covers the failure of a health authority to carry out its
statutory duties, a failure in a service provided, or maladministration causing
injustice or hardship. Complaints can only be considered if they are first sent
to the relevant health authority; sufficient time must be given for the
authorities to investigate the problem and reply to the complainant. Matters
outside the Commissioner’s jurisdiction include action taken solely in the
exercise of clinical judgment and the action of family practitioners (see p
*33)-
The Commissioner reports annually to ministers who lay the reports before
Parliament; and also publishes at regular intervals full texts of selected investi¬
gations without, however, naming individuals or institutions.
In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints (see p 68) investi¬
gates complaints concerning the health service, but not the actions of medical
practitioners or the professions supplementary to medicine.
Finance About 87 per cent of the cost of the health services is paid for through general
taxation; the rest is met from the National Health Service contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution and from the charges towards the cost
of certain items such as drugs prescribed by a family doctor, dental treatment
and spectacles. Legislation has been passed which gives health authorities
powers to raise funds from voluntary sources.
The charges for medical prescriptions do not apply to children under 16
years, expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and over and men aged
65 and over, patients suffering from certain medical conditions, war and
Service disablement pensioners (for treatment of their disability), and families
with very low incomes, including those receiving supplementary benefits and
family income supplement. About two-thirds of prescription items are
supplied free of charge. Charges for dental treatment do not apply to clinical
examination only, or to people under 21 (with the exception that young people

between 16 and 21 who have left school pay for dentures), pregnant women or
those who have had a baby within the last year. Children’s spectacles are free.
Certain low income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges.
A limited amount of hospital accommodation may be made available at a
small charge for patients wanting privacy as long as the accommodation is not
needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private
patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and can be employed full-time or part-
time. Part-time hospital doctors can accept private patients. General medical
practitioners are self-employed, paid by a system of fees and allowances
designed to reflect responsibilities, work load and practice expenses.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the ingredient cost of the
prescriptions they dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic
opticians taking part in the general ophthalmic service receive approved fees
for each sight test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according
to the number and type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is in the hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharma¬
cists working within the Service as independent practitioners, and district
nurses, midwives and health visitors employed by the health authorities; a
wide range of other services is also available including the school health service,
social services and chiropody service.
The family practitioner services are those given to patients by doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. They are administered
in England and Wales by family practitioner committees established by the
health authorities, in Scotland by the health boards and in Northern Ireland by
the Central Services Agency on behalf of the health and social services boards.
There are nearly 27,000 family doctors under contract to the National
Health Service. A doctor may not normally have more than 3,500 patients; the
average in Great Britain is about 2,300 and in Northern Ireland 2,100. Access
to most other parts of the health service is obtained through the family doctor.
There are 920 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,200 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians engaged in the general ophthalmic services which
provide for the testing of sight and supply of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are over 14,300 dentists taking part in the health service.
About 11,000 retail pharmacies under contract to the National Health
Service are responsible for dispensing prescriptions.
District nurses give skilled nursing care to people at home or elsewhere outside
hospital; they also play an important role in preventive care and health educa¬
tion. Although almost all babies are born in hospital, there is a domiciliary
service for mothers having their babies at home, with midwives and family
doctors caring for mothers and babies after birth. Midwives also assist births in
hospital. Health visitors are concerned with the health of the household as a
whole and offer an advisory service for families including those with young
children and elderly people; they undertake health teaching, assist in prevent¬
ing ill-health, and work closely with family doctors, district nurses and social
workers.
J34 BRITAIN ig8i: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Group Family doctors often work as members of primary health care teams with
Practices and health visitors, district nurses, and sometimes midwives or social workers.
Health Centres About four-fifths are in partnership or group practices. About a fifth of the
doctors in Great Britain and just over a half in Northern Ireland work in
modern and well-equipped health centres built and maintained by the health
authorities. At health centres, child health services can be provided as well as
facilities for health education, family planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental, phar¬
maceutical and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient services and support¬
ing social work services may also be provided.
SPECIALISTAND The hosPital and specialist services include district general hospitals with
SERVICES treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out¬
patients, hospital maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric
and geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all
forms of specialised treatment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally
ill, mentally handicapped and elderly people are also provided.
Hospitals A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in
the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and many new hospitals
have been or are being opened. The most recent development in hospital
design is the ‘nucleus’ hospital of some 300 beds which will make a more
intensive use of space and facilities; it can be used either as the first stage of a
new hospital or as an extension of an existing hospital. Building work on the
first nucleus hospital began in 1978 and the design is now being used widely.
The policy of recent Governments has been to concentrate acute facilities in
large district general hospitals, and to limit the role of the small hospital in
acute medicine while expanding its role in the care of the long-stay patient,
particularly the elderly (although in Scotland more of the smaller hospitals
have been retained for acute medicine). The Government has reviewed this
policy which, it considers, involves the construction of excessively large hospi¬
tals and the risk of hospital services becoming too remote from the local
communities that they serve. Consultations are taking place on changing the
emphasis in hospital building policy to provide smaller hospitals in local
communities. There are 2,625 National Health Service hospitals with about
474,000 beds and a nursing and midwifery staff of over 440,000 (whole time
equivalent). There are over 40,000 medical staff including over 13,450 consul¬
tants.
Rehabilitation Rehabilitation is an important part of medical care beginning at the onset of
illness or injury and aimed at helping people to live as normally as possible. It is
especially important for elderly, disabled and mentally-ill people who need such
help to become self-sufficient. Facilities are provided in most hospitals and at
special centres. The work is carried out by teams of doctors, nurses, physio¬
therapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists, speech therapists and
social workers. The hospital departments work closely with the Disablement
Resettlement Service of the Manpower Services Commission (the Department
of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland).
Medical services may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial limbs
and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.

Very severely physically handicapped patients may be issued with electrical
control equipment which enables them to operate devices such as alarm bells,
radio and television, a telephone, and heating. Nursing aids for the handi¬
capped at home can be borrowed.
Social workers, home helps and occupational therapists are available to
hospital patients who, due to their illness, have difficulties on returning to their
homes.
Some 50 hospices provide care for the dying either directly in residential homes
or through the provision of nursing and other assistance in the patient’s own
home. About ten are administered entirely by the National Health Service; the
remainder, most of which receive support from public funds, are run by
independent charitable organisations. Control of symptoms and psychological
support for patients and their families form the central features of hospice care.
The hospice movement, which is worldwide, originated in Britain.
Treatment for narcotic drug dependence is provided mostly on an out-patient
basis in the drug treatment units provided by the National Health Service,
although some addicts have a period of in-patient treatment when necessary.
Following legislation in 1968, only doctors licensed by the Home Secretary are
allowed to prescribe heroin and cocaine for the treatment of drug addiction.
(In Northern Ireland licensing is the responsibility of the Department of
Health and Social Services.) These doctors work mainly in National Health
Service treatment centres. Doctors who are not licensed can no longer pre¬
scribe these drugs except for the relief of pain due to organic disease or injury.
All doctors must notify the Home Secretary of any patient they consider to be
addicted to certain controlled drugs (in Northern Ireland the chief medical
officer of the health department).
In addition to hospital-based facilities there are a number of non-statutory
agencies which work with and complement the Health Service provision. In
1978 an experimental short-stay residential unit for unstable young multiple
drug users was established with substantial financial support from the
Department of Health and Social Security.
Rehabilitation facilities are less commonly available and are mainly provided
by voluntary organisations, some of which receive financial help from local
authorities. Social work help is given by the probation service and local social
services departments.
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, set up under the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971, advises ministers on a wide range of matters associated with
the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and connected social problems.
Treatment and rehabilitation for alcoholics is provided by the National Health
Service, social services and voluntary organisations. Treatment includes in¬
patient and out-patient services in general hospitals, psychiatric units and hospi¬
tals and in 34 specialised alcoholism treatment units. Primary care teams
(general practitioners, nurses and social workers) play an important part.
Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. A feature of the services is
the education of parents before and after the birth by means of talks, discussion
groups, demonstrations and classes. Pre-school-age children receive regular
medical examinations and are tested for vision, hearing, speech and language
deficiencies so that any handicap can be identified. Family planning advice and

help is provided at many clinics, and welfare foods (dried milk and vitamins)
are distributed from them.
Sick children are treated at home or in hospital as in-patients, day-patients or
out-patients. If admission to hospital is necessary, the Government encourages
health authorities to accommodate them in children’s departments under the
care of consultant paediatricians and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, which is part of the National Health Service,
organises health surveillance of school children including medical inspection
and dental inspection and treatment where appropriate. The staff of the school
health service work closely with local education authorities in the medical
assessment of handicapped children thought to need special attention.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services provide help and advice for
children with psychological or emotional problems.
Free family planning facilities are available to everyone through family plan¬
ning clinics, hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide a
similar service for women only.
Abortion
Blood
Transfusion
Under the Abortion Act 1967 termination of a pregnancy may take place if two
registered doctors think that its continuance would involve a greater risk to the
life of the pregnant woman (or injury to her physical or mental health or that of
any existing children in the family) than if the pregnancy were ended. Termi¬
nation may also be allowed if the two doctors think that there is a substantial
risk of the child being born with severe physical or mental abnormalities.
Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in private
premises officially approved for the purpose. Just over half the 119,000 legal
abortions to women resident in England and Wales in 1979 were performed in
private hospitals and clinics. The Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
The blood transfusion service has about 2 million voluntary unpaid donors.
There are 19 regional transfusion centres in Britain recruiting donors and
organising donor sessions in towns and villages, factories and offices, and in
establishments maintained by the armed forces. Donors must be between the
ages of 18 and 65. The centres are also responsible for blood grouping and
testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultant service to hospitals,
teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and technicians.
Four laboratories prepare blood products and undertake research.
Ambulance Where necessary on medical grounds, free transport by ambulance is provided
Services by the health authorities. The work of the ambulance service falls into two
categories: emergency work dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity
cases, and accidents of all kinds; and non-urgent work providing transport for
people needing out-patient treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals.
Because of increasing demands on the ambulance service its role and structure
are under review.
The London Ambulance Service is probably the largest of its kind in the
world, catering for 7 million residents and non-residents in an area of 1,580 sq
km (610 sq miles). It uses over 1,000 vehicles at 76 ambulance stations and has
a staff of over 2,600. On an average day it receives 1,700 emergency calls (over
one call every minute) and carries out 9,000 non-urgent patient journeys.
In some areas the ambulance service for non-urgent cases is augmented by
volunteers using their own cars. In Scotland an air ambulance service is
available in the islands and in the remoter parts of the mainland.
HEALTH
EDUCATION
SAFETY OF
MEDICINES
SOCIAL WELFARE ^
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland health education is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Health education services in Scotland are organised
by the Scottish Health Education Group, which is part of the Common
Services Agency. Major themes of publicity campaigns are family planning,
health in pregnancy, correct diet and exercise, and the dangers of cigarette
smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. Although expenditure for
health education is met largely from central government funds, the Health
Education Council is free to determine its own priorities and programme.
Within the Health Service, medical officers advise health authorities on
health education, and specialist officers have executive responsibility.
Under the Medicines Act 1968, which came into force in 1971 and applies to
the whole of the United Kingdom, the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of
Medicines advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of
new medicines and monitors adverse drug reactions. The Committee on
Dental and Surgical Materials gives advice on products not appropriate to the
Committee on Safety of Medicines or the Veterinary Products Committee. A
review of medicines on the market is being undertaken, the health ministers
being advised by the Committee on the Review of Medicines. The Act also
controls the advertising, labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply of
medicines.
THE HEALTH
PROFESSIONS
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers may practise
as doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. University medical and
dental schools are responsible for teaching medical students; the National
Health Service provides hospital clinical facilities for their training. Registra¬
tion as a doctor requires five or six years’ training in medical school and
hospital, with an additional year’s experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or
more years training at a dental school is required. The governing body of the
medical profession is the General Medical Council and that of the dentists is
the General Dental Council. The main professional associations are the British
Medical Association and the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick children’s,
mental or mental subnormahty nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a two-year
course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England and Wales
and in Scotland are the general nursing councils. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Midwives
Board. The examining body for nurses and midwives in Northern Ireland is
the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Pupil midwives are
usually registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the train¬
ing period is one year and for other registered and enrolled nurses 18 months.
The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are the
professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors are registered
general nurses with midwifery or approved obstetric experience who have
undergone at least the first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing
before taking a year’s course in health visiting, promoted by the Council for the
Education and 1 raining of Health Visitors. District nurses are state registered

or state enrolled nurses, the majority of whom have undertaken additional
training. Arrangements are being made to establish a United Kingdom Central
Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting which will assume
responsibility for regulating these professions.
Pharmacists in general practice and in hospital must be registered by the
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, which is the professional body for
pharmacy; in Northern Ireland the register is maintained by the Department
of Health and Social Services on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland. A three-year degree course approved by the Pharmaceutical
Society followed by a year’s approved training are necessary before registra¬
tion. The majority of medicines can be sold or dispensed only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
The General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic opti¬
cian and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or regis¬
tered medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians
takes four years including a year of practical experience under supervision.
Dispensing opticians may take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practi¬
cal experience or a part-time day-release course while employed with an
optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory scientific officers, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physio¬
therapists, radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are
eight boards, corresponding to the eight professions, under the general super¬
vision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. Professional
training lasting two to four years is needed to qualify for registration. Only
members of those professions who are state registered may be employed in the
National Health Service and some other public services.
Dental therapists (who have undergone a two-year training course) and
dental hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may
carry out some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
Britain has special health arrangements with other member states of the
European Community under which most United Kingdom nationals are
entitled to receive necessary treatment during visits to another Community
country. There are also arrangements to cover people who go to work or live in
other Community countries. In addition there are reciprocal arrangements
with some other countries under which medical treatment is available.
People who wish to do so are free to make arrangements for private medical
care, though the scale of private practice in relation to the NHS is small. In
1979 there were some 2,800 private paybeds in NHS hospitals and in England
some 2 per cent of acute hospital beds were in private hospitals and nursing
homes. It is estimated that about half of those receiving acute treatment in
NHS pay beds or private hospitals are covered by provident schemes which
make provision for private health care in return for annual subscriptions. In
1978 there were some 1 • 12 million subscribers to such schemes of whom
869,000 were members of group schemes. Subscriptions often cover more than
one person and a total of 2-39 million were covered.
Private practice is also undertaken by family doctors and dentists who are
free to accept as much private work as they wish, subject to their NHS
obligations. For the majority of doctors, however, income from private
patients represents a small part of their income, though private work by
dentists is more substantial.
SOCIAL WELFARE
I39
It is the policy of the Government to encourage the private sector to meet a
larger share of the nation’s health needs and an Act passed in 1980 repealed
earlier legislation designed to phase out private facilities within the National
Health Service, so facilitating a wider use of private medical care. The
Government believes that an expansion of private care will benefit the service
by relieving pressure on it.
ENVIRONMENTAL Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible for
HEALTH the controi 0f air pollution, noise, food hygiene and quality, the inspection of
offices, the investigation of unfit housing, and in some instances for refuse
collection. Doctors who specialise in community medicine and are employed
by the health authorities advise local authorities on the medical aspects of
environmental health. They may also assist the water authorities responsible
for water supply and sewerage. Environmental health officers are also
stationed at ports and airports where they carry out a range of duties concerned
with shipping, inspection of imported foods and disease control.
In Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control,
collection and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and
hygiene.
Safety of Food It is illegal to sell food which is injurious to health, unfit for human consump¬
tion, or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the buyer. In
England and Wales the composition, labelling and description of food are the
concern of food and drugs authorities (county councils, London borough
councils and the City of London Corporation) while food hygiene and the
safety and fitness of food are the concern of district councils, London borough
councils and port health authorities. Premises where food or drink is prepared,
handled, stored or sold must conform to certain hygiene standards.
Environmental health officers may take for analysis or for bacteriological or
other examination samples of any food on sale for human consumption. There
are special regulations controlling the safety of particular foods such as milk,
meat and ice-cream. The Department of Health and Social Security, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Welsh Office are the
central departments responsible for giving advice and making regulations.
Expert committees of these departments review food regulations.
In Scotland regional and islands councils are responsible for food standards
and labelling, and district and islands councils for food hygiene. District
councils in Northern Ireland are responsible for food hygiene, food standards
and labelling.
CONTROL OF
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of disease
and co-operate with the local authority environmental health services. The
area health authorities and health boards carry out programmes of vaccination
and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (females only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Although vaccina¬
tion is voluntary, the Government encourages parents to obtain protection for
their children from these diseases.
Community physicians are responsible for the prevention and control of
infectious diseases and are supported by the Public Health Laboratory Service
which provides a network of bacteriological and virological laboratories
throughout England and Wales which conduct research and assist in the
diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic diseases. Its largest establish¬
ment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, in north-west

London, which includes the National Collection of Type Cultures, the Food
Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories specialising in the identifica¬
tion of infective micro-organisms. In addition it has a surveillance centre,
which investigates and monitors human communicable diseases. In Scotland
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services
authorities (local authority social services departments in England and Wales,
social work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland). Many of their services are directed towards the same
groups of people needing health services, for example, elderly or disabled
people. Other groups helped include young families with social problems,
children deprived of a normal home life, the mentally ill or handicapped and
young offenders. Close co-operation is maintained between local authority
social services departments and health authorities. In Scotland local
authorities also undertake duties similar to those of the separate probation and
after-care service in England and Wales (see p 115).
Much of the care given to the elderly and disabled is provided in the
community itself, by their families, self-help groups and through the voluntary
movement. The statutory sector offers the special skilled care needed in
particular services. The Government recognises the importance of the con¬
tribution made by the voluntary organisations, especially when economies are
being made in public expenditure.
Advice on health and personal social services for children in England and
Wales is given by the Children’s Committee.
Social services authorities have a duty to provide social services for disabled
people. They are required to establish the number of disabled people in their
area and to publicise services. A wide range of facilities may be available
including advice on personal and social problems arising from disability,
assistance in overcoming the effects of disability, adaptations to people’s homes
(such as fitting ramps, ground floor toilets and grab rails) and various aids to
daily living. In certain circumstances a telephone or a television set may be
installed. Other facilities include social and occupational clubs, residential
homes and the organisation of outings and holidays. In addition some
authorities make arrangements for the teaching of handicrafts and other
occupations. Voluntary organisations also provide services for disabled
people.
Help available from other sources includes social security, medical treat¬
ment, special education, employment and training services and specially
designed housing and means of access to public buildings.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to
help them to live at home whenever possible. These may include the advice and
help of social workers, domestic help, delivery of cooked meals, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, clubs and recrea¬
tional workshops. In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting services
are arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation. Social services
authorities also provide residential accommodation for the elderly and infirm

and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or privately.
The newer homes usually have accommodation for some 30—50 residents.
About 2,600 homes for elderly people are provided by local authorities in
England which house about 1-5 per cent of the population over the age of 65.
There are similar homes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, build
flats specially designed for elderly people; some of these blocks have resident
wardens. Housing associations also build this type of accommodation.
Social services authorities must make arrangements for helping the mentally ill
or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention and after-care
services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness, which enable
patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from hospital more
quickly provided support is available in the community, are adding to demands
for these services and particularly for social work support. Arrangements
include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day centres for the
mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential care for the
mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. Social workers help patients
and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental illness or
handicap and can arrange compulsory admission (on a medical recommenda¬
tion) of mentally disordered people to hospital in certain circumstances.
Social services authorities, through their own social workers or a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special prob¬
lems. The home help service provides practical assistance at home for sick and
disabled people, elderly people and expectant mothers.
Some authorities make direct provision for the special needs of unmarried
mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done by
voluntary organisations and other bodies.
Day care facilities for children under five are provided by local authorities,
voluntary agencies and privately. In allocating places in day nurseries and
other facilities they themselves provide, local authorities give priority to chil¬
dren with special social or health needs for day care. They also register, and
provide support and advice services for, childminders, private day nurseries
and play-groups operating in their area.
The authorities have a duty to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties in order to promote the welfare of children. The aim is to
intervene at an early stage to reduce the need to receive children into care or
bring them before a juvenile court.
The recognition, prevention and management of cases of child abuse are the
concern of many authorities, agencies and professions, and area review
committees have been established throughout the country to provide a forum
for the discussion and co-ordination of all those involved and to draw up
policies and procedures for handling these cases.
Authorities must receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has
no parent or guardian or who has been abandoned or whose parents are unable
to provide for him or her if they are satisfied that such intervention is in the
interests of the child. The child remains in care until the age of 18 unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that time. In
certain circumstances the local authority may pass a resolution assuming the
rights and duties of one or both parents. The parents must be notified and if
they give notice of objection the continuance of the resolution will depend

upon its being upheld by a court of law. When taking a decision on a child in
care, the authorities have to give first consideration to the need to safeguard
and promote the welfare of the child. Where children are in care, efforts are
made to work with their families in order, where appropriate, to enable the
children to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if
they are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, are beyond the
control of parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have
committed an offence other than homicide. At the same time it must be shown
that the children are in need of care or control which they are unlikely to receive
unless a care or other relevant order is made by the court. Local authorities are
responsible for undertaking inquiries through social workers, consultation
with parents, schools and the police. Children may be committed to the care of
a local authority under a care order if the juvenile court is satisfied that they are
in need of care or control. As an alternative the court may make a supervision
order for a period of up to three years. Supervision is carried out by a social
worker or a probation officer.
In Northern Ireland the court may send children to a training school (see
p 119), commit them to the care of a fit person (which may include a health and
social services board), or make a supervision order. The law relating to
children has been reviewed and it is intended in future to form a distinction
between the young offenders and children in need of care and protection.
In Scotland children in trouble (see p 119) or in need may be brought before
a children’s hearing which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it
thinks that compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to remain at home under the super¬
vision of a social worker but some may be sent to a residential establishment
while under supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of
not more than one year until terminated by a children’s hearing.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If foster homes are not
considered appropriate or cannot be found, the children may be placed in
children’s homes, voluntary homes or other suitable residential accommoda¬
tion. Community homes for children in care in England and Wales comprise
local authority and some voluntary children’s homes and include community
homes with education on the premises which provide long-term care usually
for the more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for
placing children in their care either in foster homes, in local authority or
voluntary homes, or in residential schools. In Northern Ireland there are
residential homes for children in the care of the health and social services
boards; training schools and remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations regarding conduct of community homes and registered volun¬
tary homes and the boarding out of children in care are made by central
government.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a major part in providing accommodation for children both in the care
of local authorities and voluntary organisations. Some children’s homes run by
voluntary organisations which are not within the community homes system are
registered with central government.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units. The
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
Adoption
Social Workers

counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported cruelty or
neglect.
Adoption of children is strictly regulated by legislation and some 10,870
adoption orders were made in England and Wales in 1979, 1,144 in Scotland
and 359 in Northern Ireland; the Registrars General keep confidential regis¬
ters of adopted children. Local authorities have the power to act as adoption
agencies and eventually will be obliged to offer such a service. Voluntary
adoption societies (some 60 societies in Britain arrange adoptions) must be
registered with their local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of some European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised but this does not confer British citizenship on the
adopted person.
The effective operation of the social services is largely dependent upon the
availability of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of
social work. Training courses in social work are provided by universities,
polytechnics and colleges of further education; their length depends upon
previous educational qualifications and can extend from one to four years. The
Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work recognises social
work courses and offers advice to people considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are employed by social service departments or local authorities.
Others work in voluntary organisations or in the probation service (see p 115).
Not all social workers employed by social service departments or local
authorities are professionally qualified, but efforts are being made to increase
the number of trained personnel.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries benefits, child benefit, family income
supplement, supplementary benefits, and war pensions constitute a com¬
prehensive system of social security. The payment of many benefits depends
on prior payments to the national insurance scheme, while others are available
without contribution conditions. The former are paid from the national insur¬
ance fund which consists of contributions from employed people and their
employers, self-employed people and the Government. Non-contributory
benefits are financed from general taxation revenue.
The social security programme accounts for about a quarter of all public
expenditure. It has grown, in real terms, by £7,000 million since 1970 and now
costs the equivalent of nearly £1,000 a year for every household. Part of the
increase has been due to the rising numbers of the elderly, and part to the
growth in unemployment; much, however, has been due to real improvement
in the level of benefits, and new benefits and increased family support.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers the services in
Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are administered by the Department
of Health and Social Services. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims
for the various benefits are decided by independent tribunals.
The Government is examining and changing a number of aspects of the
social security system, both to make it more comprehensible and to reduce the
rate of growth of its cost to public funds. A new Social Security Advisory
r44
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Committee is to be established to bring together in one body advice on the
national insurance, supplementary benefit, child benefit and family income
supplement schemes. The Committee will replace the former Supplementary
Benefits Commission, the separate Supplementary Benefits Commission for
Northern Ireland and the National Insurance Advisory Committee. It is also
intended to change the basis on which the annual increases for longer-term
benefits are made; to reduce the amount of supplementary benefit payable to
strikers’ families; and to take further steps to ensure that social security
payments go only to those for whom they are intended. It is proposed to reduce
from 1981 and to end, from the beginning of 1982, the earning-related supple¬
ments paid with certain benefits and to introduce measures to help particular
groups in need to meet rising fuel costs. Consultations are taking place on
proposals to make employers responsible for sick pay during the early weeks of
sickness and the industrial injuries scheme is under review.
CONTRIBUTIONS Class 1 contributions are related to earnings and cover the employee for
Employees and retirement pension, sickness and invalidity benefits, unemployment benefit,
Employers maternity benefits, widows’ benefits, death grant and child’s special allowance.
Earnings-related supplement to sickness and unemployment benefit and
maternity allowance and earnings-related addition to widows’ allowance are
also covered (although these are being phased out—see above). Industrial
injuries benefits, although non-contributory, are payable from the national
insurance fund. Additional payments are made for dependants.
(The contribution paid by the employee varies; if he or she is not a member of
a contracted-out occupational pension scheme run by his or her employers
(see p 145), the contribution is 6-75 per cent of earnings up to £165 a week (the
upper earnings limit) provided that these earnings are at least £23 (the lower
earnings limit). The employer pays 10-2 per cent of the same earnings range. If
the employee is a member of a ‘contracted-out’ occupational pension scheme, a
lower Class 1 contribution is payable, namely 6-75 per cent of earnings up to
the lower earnings limit and 4'25 Per cent of earnings between the two limits;
the employer’s contribution is 13-7 per cent and 5-7 per cent respectively.’
Contributions are collected through the ‘Pay As You Earn’ income tax system.
The employer also pays to the Exchequer a national insurance surcharge of 3-5
per cent of the earnings range for each employee (see p 356). These rates may
be revised from year to year.
Self-employed Self-employed people pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of £2 • 50 a week and a
People Class 4 contribution amounting to 5 per cent of net profits or gains between
£2,65° and £8,300 a year. Self-employed contributors receive basic retirement
pension (see below) and the same benefits as employees with the exception of
unemployment benefit, earnings-related supplements (although this is being
phased out), and industrial injuries benefits.
Married
Women and
Widows
Certain married women and widows retain the right to pay Class 1 contribu¬
tions at the reduced rate of 2 per cent when employed and to pay no Class 2
contributions when self-employed. This right is being phased out and is
retained, subject to certain conditions, only by those entitled to it at 5 April
1978. Reduced contributions do not count for the purposes of benefit. The
employer’s contribution is not affected.
Voluntary Voluntary Class 3 contributions of £2*40 are payable by people wanting to
Contributions safeguard rights to some benefits. Class 3 (and Class 2) contributions are paid

by stamping a national insurance card or by direct debit of a bank or National
Girobank account.
Some people do not have to pay contributions. Employees who continue
working after pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions though the employer remains liable. People earning less than the
lower earnings limit are not liable for contributions, neither are their
employers. Self-employed people with earnings below £1,250 a year may apply
for exemption and those over pensionable age are excused payment of con¬
tributions.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, certain contributions have to be paid; secondly, the
full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been paid or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. There are special rules to
help a widow not entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her
children have grown up, to qualify for sickness, unemployment or maternity
benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established herself in
insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a
divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her marriage. The
main benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates quoted are
those effective from November 1980; allowances for children are paid in
addition to child benefit.
Since 1975 benefits such as retirement pension have been increased annually
in line with percentage movements in retail prices or average earnings,
whichever was the greater; short-term benefits such as sickness benefit have
been linked with movements in retail prices. From November 1980 the uprat-
ing of benefits will be linked with percentage increases in retail prices.
A state retirement pension is payable to women at the age of 60 and to men at
the age of 65. People who are still working five years after the minimum
pension age are eligible to receive the pension. The weekly rate of basic pension
is £27-15 for men and women qualifying on their own contributions and £16-30
for a married woman qualifying on her husband’s contributions. In 1978 the
new state pension scheme came into operation and will mature fully after 20
years of contributions; the retirement pension will consist of the basic pension
plus an additional (earnings-related) pension. The additional pension will be
1 -25 per cent of earnings between the earnings limits (see p 144) for each year
of contributions up to a maximun of 20 years.
Employers are free to ‘contract-out’ their employees from the state scheme
for additional pension and provide their own occupational pension in its place
provided that the latter is at least as good as the state additional pension. The
State remains responsible for the basic pension. Lower national insurance
contributions are payable if contracting-out takes place.
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from work
looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely disabled
relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with the same
earnings.
A small pension may also be payable to those people who contributed to the
state graduated pension scheme which operated between 1961 and 1975. Since
1978 graduated pension has also been protected against inflation.
In real terms the value of the basic retirement pension for a married couple
has more than doubled since 1948.

A non-contributory retirement pension of £16-30 for a man, single woman or
widow and £9-80 for a married woman (including an age addition of 25p) is
payable to people over the age of 80 who have not qualified for a contributory
pension or who qualified for one at a lower rate than the non-contributory
pension. The age addition is also paid to all other pensioners aged over 80.
A maternity grant of £25 is payable for each living child born and for a
still-born child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks. Maternity allowance
is £20-65 a week and is payable normally from 11 weeks before the expected
week of confinement until the end of the sixth week following the birth.
Mothers who have paid full Class 1 or Class 2 contributions while they were
working may qualify for maternity allowance even if they gave up work some
time previously. An earnings-related supplement may also be payable,
although this is being phased out. From 1982 the maternity grant will become
non-contributory.
The non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for
children. I he rate is £4'75 f°r each child; an additional £3 is payable to certain
people bringing up children alone for the first or only child in the family. Child
benefit, which is tax free and is normally paid to the mother, is payable for
children up to the age of 16 and for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in
full-time education; benefit is not payable if the young person is taking a
degree, teacher training or any other advanced course or if the education is
sponsored by an employer or the Manpower Services Commission, or in
Northern Ireland, by a body such as the Department of Manpower Services or
an Industrial Training Board. Benefit is payable in addition to the allowance
for children paid to recipients of social security benefits.
A contributory child’s special allowance of £7-50 a week for each child is
payable to a mother on the death of a former husband if the marriage was
dissolved or annulled and he was contributing to the support of the children.
A non-contributory guardian’s allowance is a weekly payment of £7-50 for an
orphaned child payable to a person who is entitled to child benefit for that
child. In certain circumstances it can be paid on the death of only one parent.
One of the dead parents must have satisfied a residence condition.
Additions tor children are payable with widows’, sickness, unemployment and
other benefits.
A widow’s allowance is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood at the rate
of £38 plus £7-50 for each child. An earnings-related addition earned by the late
husband’s Class 1 contributions may also be payable, although this is being
discontinued. After this a widowed mother receives a basic widowed mother’s
allowance of £27-15 plus £7-50 for each child. Widow’s pension is payable to a
widow who is 40 years or over when her husband dies or when her entitlement
to widowed mother’s allowance ends; the rates payable range from £8-15 for
widows of 40 to £27-15 for widows of 50 or over.
The widow’s pension and widowed mother’s allowance consists of a basic
pension and an additional pension earned by the late husband’s contributions.
If the widow is aged between 40 and 50 when widowed (or when her children
have grown up), additional pension is reduced like the basic pension. Payment
continues until the widow remarries or begins drawing retirement pension.
SOCIAL WELFARE 147
A man whose wife dies when both are over pension age inherits his wife’s
pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Industrial There are also benefits for widows under the industrial injuries scheme. A
Injuries pension of £38 is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood. A widow may
also receive an earnings-related addition if sufficient Class 1 contributions have
been paid by her late husband on earnings in excess of the lower earnings limit
in the relevant tax year (although this is being phased out). Thereafter, she can
receive a pension of £27-70 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her
husband’s death, or has dependent children or fulfils certain other conditions;
otherwise, she receives £8-153 week. If she was living apart from her husband,
a pension is payable only if she was receiving or entitled to receive at least 25P a
week for her maintenance from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children within the child benefit age
limits. For widows the rate is £7*50 a week for each child.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
Sick and There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sickness
Disabled People or disablement.
Sickness Benefit Contributory sickness benefit of £20-65 a week is payable for up to 28 weeks.
There are allowances of £12-75 f°r a w^e or other adult dependant and £1-25
for each child in addition to child benefit. An earnings-related supplement,
which is being phased out, may be payable for up to six months but the total of
flat-rate benefit (including increases for dependants) and supplement cannot
exceed 85 per cent of the reckonable weekly earnings on which the supplement
is based. Where the flat-rate benefit alone exceeds this it is payable in full.
Invalidity
Pension and
Allowance
Invalidity pension of £26 plus £15-60 for a wife and £7‘50 for a child, is payable
when sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary is still incapable of work. Inval¬
idity allowance (ranging from £1 -75 to £5-45 according to age) is paid with the
pension to those people who become sick more than five years before retire¬
ment age. Invalidity pension consists of a basic pension and an earnings-related
pension calculated in the same way as that for retirement pension.
Industrial Various benefits are payable for injury or disablement caused by an accident at
Injuries Benefits work or a prescribed disease.
Injury benefit for an adult is £23-40 a week plus £12-75 f°r an adult
dependant and £1 -25 for each child, in addition to child benefit. It is paid when
the employed earner is incapable of work and payment can continue for a
maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or development of
the disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws injury benefit
instead, also receives any earnings-related supplement to which he or she is
entitled subject to the 85 per cent limit on total benefit.
When injury benefit ends disablement benefit may be paid if, as the result of
the industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss of physical or
mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the disablement as
assessed by a medical board; it varies from £44-30 a week for 100 per cent
disablement to £8-90 for 20 per cent disablement, but for disablement of less
than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement at the weekly rate of £26; invalidity

allowance according to age (see above); constant attendance allowance of up to
£17-70 a week normally, or up to £35-40 in exceptionally severe cases; an
allowance of £17-70 a week payable in addition to constant attendance allow¬
ance in certain cases of exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship
allowance of up to £17-70 for a person who is unfit to return to his or her regular
job or to do work of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance
which raises the disablement benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment
during hospital treatment for the industrial injury. Increases of disablement
benefit for dependants may be payable with unemployability supplement.
There are benefits for widows and their children (see p 146).
An attendance allowance of £21-65 may be payable to severely disabled people
requiring a great deal of attention by day and at night. A lower rate of £14-45
may be paid to those who need help either by day or at night. A non¬
contributory invalidity pension of £16-30 is payable to people of working age
unable to work and not qualifying for the national insurance invalidity pen¬
sion; it is also payable to disabled housewives incapable of work and unable to
perform their normal household tasks.
A weekly invalid care allowance of £16-30 may be payable to certain
categories of people (aged between 16 and pension age) who cannot go out to
work because they are caring for a severely disabled relative receiving an
attendance allowance.
Physically disabled people unable or virtually unable to walk may be entitled
to a mobility allowance of £14-50 a week to help pay their transport costs.
People aged between 5 and 65 are eligible to claim the allowance. Those who
establish an entitlement before the age of 65 may keep the allowance until the
age of 75. An independent organisation called Motability assists those disabled
drivers and disabled passengers wanting to use their mobility allowance to
obtain a vehicle.
Unemployment benefit at the same rate as sickness benefit (see p 147) is
payable for up to 312 days (not counting Sundays) in any one spell of un¬
employment. Periods of unemployment benefit which are 6 weeks or less apart
and periods of unemployment benefit which are more than 6 weeks apart but
which are linked by periods of sickness benefit, maternity allowance or training
allowance count as one period. Earnings-related supplement, which is being
phased out, may be payable on the same basis as that for sickness benefit.
Generally speaking anyone claiming unemployment benefit has to be regis¬
tered for employment at a local office of the Manpower Services Commission
(in Northern Ireland the Department of Manpower Services) which helps
people to find jobs.
A death grant is payable on the death of a contributor or a contributor’s near
relative. It is normally £30 for an adult and a smaller sum for a child.
The supplementary benefits scheme provides a safety net of support for the
poorest people, covering more than 3 million beneficiaries at any one time.
Any person aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work and who does not
have enough money to live on may be entitled to benefit. It is not normally
awarded to people attending school or for their own needs to people involved in
industrial disputes (dependants of strikers are covered, however, but under
new legislation assessments for benefit assume that strikers are providing £12 a
week themselves, either in trade union strike pay or from some other source).

In Northern Ireland a residence condition must also oe satisfied. The
benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the
minimum retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s needs exceed his or her available
resources, both being defined by rules approved by Parliament. The calcula¬
tion of needs is based on different amounts for single people and family groups
(for blind people there is a special addition) with, in each case, an addition for
rent. A higher long-term scale is used for people over pensionable age and for
people under pension age who have received supplementary benefit for more
than a year without having to register for work. Additions can be made for
requirements such as a special diet or extra heating. Certain needy groups
receive the heating addition automatically. A single payment may be made to
meet an exceptional need. When resources are calculated, most social security
benefits are taken into account in full. Part of most other income including
part-time earnings, disablement benefit and war widow’s pension is ignored, as
is the capital value of an owner-occupied house or other capital resources of less
than £1,250 (this is being increased to £2,000).
The payment of a supplementary allowance to an able-bodied person of
working age may be conditional on registering for work at an unemployment
benefit office of the Department of Employment or, in Northern Ireland, the
Department of Manpower Services.
The Department of Health and Social Security has a duty to influence
people without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. It provides
temporary accommodation for them in 23 reception centres, one of which is
administered by a local authority on its behalf. For men who have been
unemployed for long periods and who are receiving supplementary allowances,
there are 17 re-establishment centres, three of which have residential accom¬
modation, where they are given help to fit them again for work. These
provisions do not apply in Northern Ireland.
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families with small incomes
where the head of the family is in full-time work and where there is at least one
dependent child. It is payable when the gross weekly income of a family falls
below a prescribed amount, fixed at £67 a week where there is one child plus £7
for each additional child. The weekly rate of the supplement is half the
difference between the family’s income and the prescribed amount up to a
maximum of £17 for a one-child family and this is increased by £1-50 for each
additional child. The supplement includes a special addition to help with the
cost of heating.
Families receiving the supplement are automatically entitled to a number of
other benefits including free school meals, milk and vitamins for expectant
mothers and for children under school age, exemption from prescription
charges and National Health Service charges for dental treatment and glasses.
A similar, but independent, scheme is run in Northern Ireland.
The war pensions scheme is administered throughout the United Kingdom by
the Department of Health and Social Security. Pensions are payable to people
disabled as a result of service in the armed forces or from injuries received in
the merchant navy or civil service during war-time or to civilians injured by
enemy action.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier
is £44'30 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and to the degree of
disablement. An allowance for dependants is paid in addition to the basic
I5° BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£28-80 a week), constant attendance (from £8-85 to
£35-4° a week), comforts (£3-85 to £7-70 a week), and lowered standard of
occupation (up to £17-70 a week). An age allowance (from £3-10 to £9-60 a
week) is payable to disabled pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate of
pension for widows of private soldiers is £35-30 a week, with additional
allowances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to
£13-40 a week). There is an additional allowance of £3-45 for widows aged 65
which is increased to £6-90 at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works closely with many
voluntary and ex-Service organisations who give financial aid and personal
help to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.

Social security benefits, other than child, maternity, unemployment, sickness,

pensions and allowances are not taxable.
In addition to payments provided under the social security legislation, there
are a number of other benefits for which people with low incomes may be
eligible. These include legal aid and assistance (see p 128), rent rebates and
allowances (see p 193), rate rebates (see p 66), exemption from health service
charges (see p 132) and free school meals (see p 162).
As part of the Community’s efforts to promote the free movement of labour,
there are regulations providing for equality of treatment and the protection of
social security rights for employed people taking up a job in another member
state. The regulations also cover retirement pensioners and other beneficiaries
who have been employed, as well as dependants. Benefits affected include
child benefit and those for sickness and maternity, unemployment, retirement,
invalidity, accidents at work and occupational diseases.
VOLUNTARY SERVICES
There is a long tradition of voluntary service to the community and the
partnership between the voluntary and statutory agencies is encouraged. It has
been estimated that about 5 million people take part in some voluntary work
during the course of a year. Central and local government make grants to
voluntary agencies and public authorities plan and carry out their duties taking
account of the work of voluntary organisations. Many services are provided for
by both local authorities and voluntary agencies, for example, residential care
for elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and for
children. At the same time, however, voluntary provision and community
self-help enable local authorities to continue the trend towards community

rather than institutional care for elderly, mentally ill and mentally handi¬
capped people. The Government is maintaining the real value of its grants to
national voluntary bodies, and financing some experimental work at local level.
Tax changes in the financial years 1980-81 and 1981-82 are designed to help
the voluntary movement to secure a larger flow of funds.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service through¬
out Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
Many voluntary organisations are registered charities, and in England and
Wales the Charity Commission, a government agency, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary. It maintains central and local registers of
charities which are open to public inspection, and it investigates and checks
abuses, though it has no power to act in the administration of a charity.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations ranging from national bodies
to small individual local groups. Most are members of larger associations or are
represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some
are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the formation of
public opinion and exchange of information. Some carry out both functions.
They may be staffed by both professional and voluntary workers.
The main voluntary body in England which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies is the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations which acts as a resource and development agency for
the voluntary sector. It works to extend the involvement of voluntary organisa¬
tions in dealing with social issues, to protect the interests and independence of
voluntary agencies, and to provide them with a range of advice, information
and other services. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service, the
Council of Social Service for Wales and the Northern Ireland Council of Social
Service, which perform similar functions.
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned with personal and family prob¬
lems include the family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association,
Family Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisa¬
tions; the National Council for One Parent Families; Child Poverty Action
Group and the Claimants’ Union, both of which provide expert advice on
social security benefits; and the Samaritans, who help the lonely, the de¬
pressed and the suicidal.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people; this is often
channelled through national and local organisations such as Community Ser¬
vice Volunteers, Task Force, Scouts and Girl Guides.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others— the
British Red Cross Society, St John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which help people with
particular disabilities and difficulties include the Royal National Institute for
the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, MIND (National Associ¬
ation for Mental Health), the National Society for Mentally Handicapped
Children, the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help
the Aged and their equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
National organisations whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on
Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s
Society, the Church of England Council for Social Aid, the Young Men’s

Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the

A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with
family problems and assists in hospitals and clinics, and work in emergencies.
Some 825 Citizens Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to citizens
who are in doubt about their rights or who do not know about the State or
voluntary services available. There are law centres (see p 128) and housing
advisory centres in some areas.
The Volunteer Centre is a national voluntary organisation and a centre for
information and research on voluntary work, established with the aid of a
government grant. There are many local volunteer bureaux.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, makes discrimination between men and
women unlawful in employment, education, training and the provision of
housing, goods, facilities and services. Discriminatory advertisements which
breach the Act are also unlawful. The Act applies to both direct and indirect
sex discrimination: direct discrimination is treating one person less favourably
than another on the grounds of his or her sex; indirect discrimination is
applying a condition or requirement which, though apparently neutral, in
effect acts significantly to the disadvantage of one sex and cannot be justified on
its merits. Northern Ireland has similar legislation.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 (and corresponding legislation in Northern
Ireland), women are entitled to equal pay with men when doing work that is
the same or broadly similar or work which has been given an equal value under
a job evaluation scheme.
The Equal Opportunities Commission was established to enforce both Acts
and promote equal opportunities between the sexes. There is a separate
commission in Northern Ireland.
Employers must not discriminate against a man or woman because of his or her
sex. This applies to recruitment, promotion, the provision of benefits, dismis¬
sals and training. It is also unlawful for employers to discriminate against a
person on grounds of marriage. There are a limited number of exceptions
including employment in private households and employment in jobs where a
person’s sex is a ‘genuine occupational qualification’, such as acting.
Employers of not more than five people are exempt from the Act.
Co-educational schools, colleges and universities may not discriminate in
the provision of facilities or in their admissions. Single-sex establishments are
permissible, however, and there are arrangements for such institutions to
move gradually towards co-education if they wish.
It is unlawful to discriminate against a man or a woman in the sale or letting
of land, houses, flats and business premises. The law applies equally to public
and private housing, furnished and unfurnished. The Act does not apply to
lettings in a small dwelling occupied by the landlord or a near relative.
Discrimination is also unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and
services. For example, banks, building societies or finance companies must not
refuse to give credit, mortgages or loans to women on terms that would be
applied to men. Exceptions include services provided in certain special care

establishments such as hospitals; places used for religious purposes where
religious susceptibilities would be offended; places where it is necessary to
preserve decency or privacy; competitive sports in which for reasons of
physique women would be at a disadvantage; and life insurance and similar
matters where risk is assessed on reliable actuarial or other data.
It is unlawful to publish or place advertisements which contravene the Sex
Discrimination Act whether for jobs, goods, facilities or services.
Complaints of discrimination may be brought before the county courts in
England and Wales or the sheriff courts in Scotland, except for complaints
concerning employment, which are dealt with by industrial tribunals (see
P 338)- Complaints concerning State educational establishments must first be
made to the relevant Secretary of State before they can be brought before a
court. Only the Equal Opportunities Commission is responsible for handling
complaints about discriminatory advertisements and can bring proceedings in
matters concerning advertising. Where necessary, legal advice or assistance, or
legal aid if the case is taken to court, are available for complainants with low
incomes (see p 128). Legal aid is not available for industrial tribunal cases but
applicants can receive advice and assistance.
The Equal Opportunities Commission was established to enforce the Sex
Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act. Its aims are to eliminate sex
discrimination and to promote equal opportunities. The Commission advises
people of their rights under both Acts, and in certain circumstances, may give
financial help or assist individuals to prepare and conduct a case before a court
or tribunal. It may also attempt to secure a settlement. The Commission has
power to conduct formal investigations and, if satisfied that practices are
unlawful, can issue non-discrimination notices requiring discriminatory prac¬
tices to stop. For certain formal investigations, the Commission has the power
to require a person to give information and to attend hearings to give evidence.
In addition it keeps the workings of the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts
under review and may submit proposals for amending them to the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Employment respectively.
RACE RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to settle and take up
employment, and they make an important contribution to the economy and the
public services. In 1978 the population of New Commonwealth1 and Pakistani
ethnic origin was estimated at some 1 -9 million (about 3-5 per cent of the total
population) of whom some 40 per cent were born in Britain. Nearly three-
quarters live in the south-east and the west Midlands. Although, as Common¬
wealth citizens, they have full political and civic rights, many suffer from social
and economic disadvantages. This can be partly attributed to the fact that
many initially lack the skills needed in an industrial society and occupy
low-status jobs in poor environments of the older towns. Unemployment is
relatively high among young people in some ethnic minority communities.
Another factor, the extent of which is difficult to determine, is that of racial
discrimination.

The difficulties experienced by residents of the older inner city areas are
being alleviated by continuous social programmes which benefit the whole
community and others which are directed at areas of special social need.
Additional teachers have been appointed to schools with ethnic minorities and
government grants are available to local authorities with substantial ethnic
minority groups towards the salaries of extra staff, such as interpreters, health
visitors and helpers in schools and community homes. Language teaching is
recognised to be of prime importance in schools and schemes arranged for
adults include classes at their place of work and language groups run by
voluntary organisations. The welfare of ethnic minorities and good relations
between minorities and the local community are promoted by community
relations councils and other voluntary bodies. In recognition of the special
problems and tensions that can arise between the police and ethnic minorities,
police community liaison work is seen as having particular importance. Policies
for promoting equality of opportunity among ethnic minorities are pursued
against a background of legislation designed to protect them from discrimina¬
tion.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, training and related matters, in education, in housing
and in advertising. It strengthened legislation passed in 1968 which, in turn,
widened the scope of the first race relations legislation enacted in 1965.
The 1976 Act brought the law against racial discrimination into line with
that against sex discrimination (see above), and gave complainants direct
access to civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial
tribunals. Complaints concerning educational establishments are made first to
the appropriate education minister. The remedies available from the courts are
damages, a declaration of rights or an injunction. Industrial tribunals are also
able to declare the rights of parties, make recommendations or award compen¬
sation. Legal aid (see p 128) is available to complainants with low incomes.
The 1976 Act also strengthened the criminal law on incitement to racial
hatred. A prosecution made under the Act may only be brought in England and
Wales by, or with the consent of, the Attorney General.
The Commission for Racial Equality works towards the elimination of dis¬
crimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations
between different racial groups. It has powers to investigate unlawful dis¬
criminatory practices and to issue non-discrimination notices, enforceable in
the courts, requiring that such practices should cease. The Commission has
sole responsibility for those contraventions of the 1976 Act which do not result
in a particular person being discriminated against, for example, discriminatory
advertisements and instructions; it may also assist individuals with their
complaints. It has an important educational role and has power to issue codes
of practice in employment.
The Commission supports and co-ordinates the work of some no local
community relations councils operating in areas with significant minority
groups; their purpose is to promote harmonious community relations. It
makes grants towards the salaries of community relations officers and towards
special projects which help to improve community relations or to assist mem¬
bers of the ethnic minorities. Particular encouragement is given to self-help
schemes run by members of the minority communities.
Policies
7 Education
British education aims to develop fully the abilities of individuals, both young
and old, for their own benefit and that of society as a whole. The aim has
assumed a new importance in an age of rapid technological change. Compul¬
sory schooling for children takes place between the ages of 5 and 16, although
some provision is made for those under 5, and many pupils remain at school
beyond the minimum leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at univer¬
sities, polytechnics and further education colleges) is organised flexibly to
provide a wide range of opportunities for academic and vocational education
and continuing study throughout life.
For many years British education has been characterised by change, and
much of the post-1945 period has also been marked by growth: large increases
in the number of pupils, the expansion of higher educational opportunities,
and increased expenditure. Although the process of change continues, recent
years have seen increasing reassessment and consolidation as well as a number
of other significant developments, including the beginning of a substantial
drop in the number of school children following a fall in the birth rate, a
slowing down in the demand for higher education, and the need, because of
economic circumstances, to reduce public expenditure. The number of
primary school children has already fallen sharply, and the decline in numbers
is about to affect secondary schools. It has led to a reduced demand for new
teachers (although there is still a need for more teachers of certain specialised
subjects) and the teacher training system has been reorganised to cope with the
new situation while retaining flexibility for future expansion.
The Government’s education policies have been formulated to increase
parental choice and involvement in school organisation, to allow local
authorities to organise publicly maintained schools according to local needs
and to take up places for pupils at independent schools where appropriate, and
to assist children from less well-off homes to benefit from attendance at certain
non-maintained schools. Proposals are being developed in England and Wales
for national agreement on a framework for the school curriculum, and for the
replacement of the dual system of examinations taken at about the age of 16 by a
single examination. Other proposals include the improvement of special edu¬
cational facilities for handicapped children, and the provision of better voca¬
tional education and training for the i6-to-i8 age group. It is recognised that
co-operation between education and industry can help the young to acquire the
skills necessary to allow Britain to maintain its position as one of the world’s
leading exporters of manufactured goods. Many organisations already work to
improve contacts between educational institutions and industry, and further
links are being encouraged, especially locally. A four-year programme to give
schools and colleges a better understanding of micro-electronics is being
planned to serve as a means of equipping young people with the skills they need
to exploit the economic potential of this technology.
About 80 per cent of education expenditure is incurred by local authorities,
to which grants are made by central government in support of services, with
I56

SCHOOLS

the authorities planning their own spending according to local needs and
circumstances. Support for the universities and certain other higher education
institutions, and grants to students, account for most of the direct expenditure
by central government. Spending on education (some £9,542 million in 1979,
5 • 8 per cent of the gross domestic product) amounts to more than 11 per cent of
all public expenditure, but a reduction is planned in the years to 1983-84
taking into account the declining number of school children and considerable
savings in the provision of school meals and milk. In spite of cuts in expendi¬
ture, government policy is to maintain and improve the quality of education.
Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, and for the Government’s
relations with and support for universities throughout Great Britain. (He is
also responsible for civil science, p 44.) The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have full responsibility in their respective
countries for non-university education; they are consulted about (but do not
carry formal responsibility for) education in universities and civil science.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is de¬
centralised. Responsibilities are divided between the central government
departments (the Department of Education and Science, the Welsh Office, the
Scottish Education Department, and the Department of Education for North¬
ern Ireland), local education authorities (education and library boards in
Northern Ireland), and various voluntary organisations. The relationship
between these bodies is based on consultation and co-operation.
Local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and most post-school education outside the universities, and provide
grants to students proceeding to higher education (including universities).
They employ the teachers and other staff, provide and maintain the buildings,
supply equipment and materials and decide local policy. In Scotland the
central institutions which provide most vocational further education to degree
level, and colleges of education which provide teacher training, are adminis¬
tered by independent governing bodies. Three of the central institutions are
financed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland; all the
remaining central institutions and all the colleges of education are financed
directly by the Scottish Education Department which also pays grants to
students on advanced courses. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Polytechnic (an
institution of higher education) is likewise administered by an independent
board of governors and is financed directly by the Department of Education for
Northern Ireland. Colleges of education are controlled by the Department or
voluntary agencies.
Universities are autonomous, with governing bodies appointed according to
the terms of individual charters or statutory provisions. The Government
exercises its responsibilities in relation to the universities and provides finan¬
cial help to them through the University Grants Committee (see p 163).
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Over 11 million children attend Britain’s 38,500 schools. Most receive free
education financed from public funds, but a small proportion (very roughly 6
per cent) attend schools wholly independent of public financial support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools and in an

increasing number of secondary schools. Over 80 per cent of pupils in main¬
tained secondary schools in England and Wales and over 50 per cent in
Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary
schools are mixed. Most independent schools for younger children are co¬
educational, but the majority providing secondary education are single-sex.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided and
maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds. Volun¬
tary schools have mostly been established by religious denominations; they are
wholly maintained from public funds but the governors of some types of
voluntary school contribute to capital costs. Nearly a third of the 30,400
schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are
voluntary schools: of the remainder some 5,760 are Church of England, 2,640
are Roman Catholic, and 330 belong to other groups and religious denomina¬
tions. Each publicly maintained school has a governing body, which includes
governors appointed by the local education authority. The Education Act 1980
provides for the wider representation of parents and teachers on school govern¬
ing bodies: it is proposed that all schools should have at least two parent and
two teacher governors normally elected by parents and teachers. In Scotland
most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by education
authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for a
type of independent school, see p 158).
In Northern Ireland there are two main categories of school: voluntary
schools which are mainly under Roman Catholic management receiving grants
of up to 85 per cent of capital costs and up to 100 per cent of running costs; and
controlled schools owned and managed by the area education and library
boards and having all their expenditure met from public funds. Government
policy is to encourage integration between Protestant and Roman Catholic
school education where there is a local desire for it, but it is not the intention to
enforce integrated education against the wishes of local communities.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools, and books and equipment are free. In Scotland, education
authorities may charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the
adequate provision of free school education (although no authorities make use
of this power). In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children
attending grant-aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where a
small proportion of pupils are admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Successive Governments have expanded nursery education within the con¬
straints of limited resources, and by 1979 the number of children in nursery
schools or nursery classes in England had risen to over 210,000. In addition
about 218,000 children under five were attending infants’ classes in primary
schools. This means that over half of four-year-olds and almost a fifth of
three-year-olds were receiving education in publicly-maintained schools. In
addition many children attend informal pre-school playgroups organised by
parents and voluntary bodies.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales go
to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age of transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but a number of local authorities in
England have established ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to 8 or 10 and ‘middle’
x58

schools covering various age ranges between 9 and 14. In Scotland, the
primary schools take children from 5 to 12, normally having infant classes for
children under 7, although in a few areas there are separate infant schools.
The publicly maintained system of education aims to give all children an
education suited to their particular abilities. Over 85 per cent of the maintained
secondary school population in England and Wales attend some 3,600 com¬
prehensive schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude
and provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children
of a district. They can be organised in a number of ways including schools
that take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools
whose pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or 14, leaving
at 16 or 18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a
sixth-form or ‘tertiary’ college for pupils over 16. Most other children receive
secondary education in ‘grammar’ and ‘secondary modern’ schools to which
they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11; in 1979 there were
261 grammar schools in England and Wales and 547 secondary modern
schools. Under the Education Act 1980 the compulsion on local education
authorities to reorganise their schools on comprehensive lines has been
removed.
Under the same Act parents’ wishes must be taken into account as fully as
possible in the choice of schools for their children, and they must receive full
information about the schools available and have open to them an effective
channel of appeal at a local level. The Act also provides for the establishment of
an assisted-places scheme devised to help (by means of a system of fees
remission related to parental income) children of high ability from less well-off
homes to attend independent schools belonging to the scheme. The scheme
will operate in England and Wales from 1981.
Scottish secondary education is almost completely organised according to
the comprehensive principle and almost all pupils in education authority
secondary schools are in schools with a non-selective intake. The majority of
schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because of local circumstances
there are some comprehensive schools at which courses may extend to four
years or less; pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth years to a
six-year comprehensive school. Consultations are taking place about involving
parents in the choice of their children’s schools and there are plans to establish
an assisted-places scheme similar to that in England and Wales. Northern
Ireland secondary education is organised largely along selective lines.
Independent schools receive no grants from public funds but all are open to
inspection and must register with the appropriate government education
department which has power to require them to remedy any objectionable
features in their premises, accommodation or instruction and to exclude any
person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be the proprietor of a school. In
default, the appropriate Secretary of State can, in effect, close a school, but
schools have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal against any of the
requirements. There are about 2,400 registered independent schools.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most
important of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or 13
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Headmasters’
Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of Girls’ Schools Associa¬
tion. They should not be confused with the State-supported public schools in Scotland.

years of age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There are
about 460 public schools in England and Wales, most of them single-sex (about
half of them for girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some
co-educational schools, and certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit
girls direct to their senior forms. Combined tuition and boarding fees in the
public schools are on average £2,600 a year, but some of this may be remitted
for children winning competitive scholarships. Local education authorities in
England and Wales may assist with the payment of fees for children at inde¬
pendent and other non-maintained schools. A number of preparatory schools
prepare children for entry to the public schools.
There are some 2,000 separate special schools (both day and boarding) for several
categories of disability: the blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially hearing,
delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in Scotland), epilep¬
tic, maladjusted, physically handicapped, autistic and those suffering from
speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
For a number of years the general trend has been increasingly to provide
special educational treatment in ordinary schools where this is in the educa¬
tional interest of the particular child and the nature of his or her disability
permits. Legislation yet to be brought into effect in England and Wales
provides for such children to be educated in such schools whenever practicable
and compatible with efficient teaching. There are a number of new arrange¬
ments whereby varying degrees of integration are being achieved between
special schools and ordinary primary and secondary schools.
In 1978 the Warnock Committee report (see Bibliography) recommended
that the concept of special education appropriate to defined categories of bodily
or mental handicap should be replaced by the broader notion of the special
educational needs of individual children. This would cover not only children
with physical or mental disabilities but also those with emotional or
behavioural disorders and those with significant learning difficulties. The
Government proposes to introduce a new framework for special education
substantially along the lines recommended in the report.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or school governing bodies. There are more than 500,000 teachers
(including the full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in publicly main¬
tained and assisted schools in Britain and the pupil/teacher ratio is about 18 to
1. Teachers must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate education
department. Their salaries are determined by nationally negotiated scales,
taking account of qualifications, responsibilities and experience.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority, or, in the case of secondary
schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice, responsibility is largely
devolved upon head teachers and their staff. In Wales, the Welsh language is
taught and is used as either the main or secondary medium of teaching in some
schools. Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools are responsible to the Secretary of
State for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Wales for the
inspection of all schools, including independent schools. They review and
report on the content and value of the education provided and advise local
education authorities, schools and the Government. Local education
authorities also employ inspectors or advisers to guide them on maintained
schools. Institutions concerned with the education and training of teachers are

additional sources of advice. Curriculum materials and further guidance and
encouragement for school-based research and development are available to
teachers through the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations. The
Council, an independent body representative of all concerned with education,
acts as an advisory body and sponsors and carries out research and develop¬
ment work on curricula, teaching methods and examinations in primary and
secondary schools. The Schools Committee for Wales carries out similar
activities. In many cases there are Teachers’ Centres (some 500 in England and
Wales) at which teachers meet for curriculum development work, discussion
and in-service training.
In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same
as in England and Wales; the content and balance of the curriculum is kept
under continuous review by the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum.
Provision is made, where appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic. Northern
Ireland has a Schools Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with
the Schools Council; the Inspectorate of the Department of Education helps
and advises teachers and inspects and evaluates the work of all schools.
The content, balance and breadth of the school curriculum, and the extent
to which it meets national needs by preparing pupils for working life, has been
the subject of continuing public interest in recent years. Following the review
of local authority arrangements for the school curriculum in England and
Wales the subjects considered as essential to every pupil’s education were
set out in the consultative document A Framework for the School Curriculum
(see Bibliography). A final version, after further discussion, will contain guid¬
ance for local education authorities and schools. In Scotland consideration is
being given to similar proposals for a core of essential subjects in secondary
schools.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools receive
religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless
their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in voluntary
schools, religious instruction of a non-denominational character is given which
may include the study of comparative religions. In all kinds of voluntary
schools there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland,
subject to safeguards for the individual conscience, religious instruction must
be given, but the content is determined by education authorities and by the
schools themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own
schools. In controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access
which may be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools
corporate worship and religious education are controlled by the management
authorities.
There is a general concern that there should be a coherent and soundly-based
means of assessing pupils, schools, and the educational system as a whole.
The Assessment of Performance Unit of the Department of Education and
Science, which promotes the development of methods for assessing and
monitoring the performance of children at school, has commissioned research
teams to develop tests suitable for national monitoring of English language,
mathematics and science at the end of the primary stage of education and again
at the age of 15. The first national survey of mathematics performance of pupils
aged 11 has been completed and the Unit is undertaking surveys in mathema¬
tics at 15-plus and in English language and science at both primary and
secondary level. It is also looking into the possibility of monitoring perform-

ance in foreign languages and other subjects. The Unit is also devising tests to
set national standards in reading, writing, and arithmetic.
In the majority of schools, teachers and pupils make use of a range of educa¬
tional aids to assist the processes of teaching and learning. In addition to
printed resources, these also include audio-visual aids of every kind which may
be commercially made or produced in a resource centre, either within the
school or in one serving all the schools in a local education authority’s area.
Educational broadcasting is of major importance. Almost all schools can
receive radio and television programmes. Flexibility in use is increased when
these are recorded; most educational radio programmes are used in this way as
are an increasing number of educational television programmes. In addition
the British Broadcasting Corporation produces a large number of radiovision
programmes which, in effect, are low cost tape/slide units. Teachers’ notes and
pupils’ pamphlets accompany many broadcast series. Each year more than 500
hours of school radio and 600 hours of school television are transmitted by the
BBC and the independent broadcasting companies.
The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom and the
Educational Foundation for Visual Aids, among their other functions, offer
advice on the use of audio-visual aids. In Scotland this function is undertaken
by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
Computers are increasingly used to assist learning, to plan timetables, and in
the management of courses.
There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, lead¬
ing to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate
of Education (GCE). Both the CSE and the GCE Ordinary (‘O’) level are
designed for pupils completing five years of secondary schooling and are
normally taken at the age of 16. The GCE Advanced (‘A’) level is normally
taken after a further two years’ study. The CSE is controlled by 14 regional
examining boards while the GCE examinations are conducted by eight inde¬
pendent examining boards, most of them connected with a university. Entries
for GCE examinations are accepted from candidates at further education
establishments and from candidates entering privately.
The highest grade in the CSE is widely accepted as being of the same
standard as at least grade C at GCE ‘O’ level and these are the qualifying grades
for entry to further education and training. The ‘A’ level examination is the
standard for entrance to higher education, university and to many forms of
professional training. The examination system has been widely discussed for
some years by the Government, the Schools Council and others. The
Government has proposed that the present system should be simplified by
replacing the ‘O’ level and CSE with a single examination, and is reviewing
suggestions for the introduction of an additional examination, the Certificate
of Extended Education (CEE), to be taken after a one-year course by those who
stay on in full-time education after 16 but for whom ‘A’ levels are not suitable.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of
Education Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the Ordinary grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth year are presented for
the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the basis for entry to
university or professional training. For those who have completed their main
studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in particular

subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies. Proposals have been made
for the development of courses and examinations suitable for less able pupils
who do not take, or achieve a low grade, in the ‘O’ grade examination as well as
courses more challenging than ‘O’ grade for particularly able pupils. These are
expected to be introduced from 1986.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and Wales. !
The International Baccalaureate, which is offered to sixth formers by several
educational institutions in Britain, leads either to a diploma, or to separate
subject certificates, the latter being recognised for admission to higher educa¬
tion in Britain and many other countries.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have the
use of a playing field, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The Department of Health and Social Security is responsible for the medical
inspection of school children and for advice and treatment of specific medical
and dental problems associated with children of school age.
In keeping with the Government’s policy of reducing the level of spending in
the non-educational section of the education budget, the statutory duty on
education authorities to provide school meals and milk has been relaxed. Local
education authorities are given discretion to decide what milk, meals or other
refreshment to provide at their schools, and what charges to make. Provision
has to be made free of charge, however, for pupils from families receiving
certain social security benefits. Those local authorities providing milk for
school children at a reduced price are eligible for a European Community
subsidy. Under certain conditions the authorities must provide free school
transport, and they have discretionary powers to assist financially in the
provision of transport for pupils between their home and school.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies (in Scotland education
authorities) are responsible, under the general supervision of the central
departments, for providing the schools and other buildings needed for public
education in their areas. The central departments determine the maximum size
of the authorities’ individual programmes in the light of national priorities;
they also offer guidance to authorities in various ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 16,500 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing schools; over 9 million
new places have been provided.
Government grants are normally available to help with the costs of building
new voluntary aided schools and with alterations and external repairs to
existing aided schools.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods
in design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been
widely adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well
as to have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor
games.
Education for those who have left school is organised very flexibly. It is
available to everyone above school-leaving age, is provided at all levels and may
be part-time or full-time, vocational or non-vocational.

More than a third of young people receive some form of post-school educa¬
tion, compared with a fifth in 1965. Many courses lead to recognised qualifica¬
tions, varying from degrees and professional qualifications through technician
level to qualifications similar to those obtained before leaving school. Further
education is a broad term usually taken to refer to all post-school education
outside the universities. Higher education (postgraduate, first-degree and
similar level work) is provided at universities and on advanced courses at
polytechnics and other establishments of higher and further education. Adults
of every age make extensive use of facilities for the educational and cultural
leisure activities included under the term ‘adult education’.
The principal institutions of post-school education are the 45 universities (see
p 164); the 30 polytechnics in England and Wales and the 14 Scottish central
institutions; the Ulster Polytechnic in Northern Ireland; and well over 800
other colleges which are maintained or assisted from public funds, some of
which provide a very wide range of courses, while others concentrate on
particular subjects. All these institutions offer courses leading to recognised
qualifications, while their premises as well as school and other premises are
often also used for adult education.
Apart from the universities, most establishments of post-school education
are maintained and administered by the local education authorities. However,
the Scottish central institutions, the Scottish colleges of education and the
Ulster Polytechnic do not come under the control of the education authorities,
but are managed by independent governing bodies, representing the
authorities and other appropriate interests.
In addition, there are many independent specialist establishments, such as
secretarial colleges, correspondence colleges and colleges teaching English as a
foreign language; a number of voluntary bodies and private undertakings
providing cultural and general education, sometimes with financial or other
assistance from local education authorities; and a large number of other
education and training schemes run by public or private organisations.
Most establishments for post-school education are either maintained or
assisted from public funds. Where industrial training is provided by a college,
the charges are the responsibility of the employer, and broadly reflect the
economic cost of provision.
Although largely dependent on public funds, the universities are guaranteed
as autonomous institutions by a special financial arrangement. The University
Grants Committee is appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and
Science to advise on State aid to the universities; its members are drawn from
the academic and business worlds. This body acts as a link and buffer between
the Government from which it receives a block grant and the universities to
which it allocates this grant. So, although the Government is responsible for
financing over 90 per cent of universities’ expenditure (universities or colleges
within universities may have their own investments, endowments and
budgets), it does not control their work or teaching. The Open University (see
p 165) is financed directly by the Department of Education and Science; in
Northern Ireland government grants are made direct to the universities by the
Department of Education.
Some 845,000 students take full-time and sandwich courses (courses where
substantial periods of full-time study alternate with periods of supervised
experience on a relevant job) at universities and major establishments of

further education in Britain (1977-78 figures). Of these about 288,000 are at
universities while another 233,000 follow advanced courses outside univer¬
sities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics and Scottish
central institutions. More than 324,000 take non-advanced courses, most of
them studying for recognised vocational or educational qualifications.
Additionally, there are over 3-3 million part-time students, over 600,000 of
whom are released by their employers for further education during working
hours. Many of the remainder take part in adult education classes (see p 167).
Many full-time students are helped by awards from public funds. These
awards are mandatory for most students taking first-degree and other compar¬
able courses who qualify under national rules. (Grants for other courses may
be given at the discretion of a local education authority.) They are assessed to
cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but where parents can afford to
contribute towards the cost this is taken into account. In England and Wales
these awards are made by local education authorities up to first-degree level; in
Scotland by the Scottish Education Department; and in Northern Ireland by
the Department of Education for Northern Ireland. Grants for postgraduate
study and research are offered by the education departments and the research
councils. In all, about 90 per cent of students on full-time and sandwich
advanced courses receive help from public funds. Some scholarships are
available from endowments and from particular industries or companies.
Following rapid expansion during the last two decades higher education is
moving into a period of consolidation. Some 8 per cent of 18-year-olds enter
courses of higher education. About 522,000 full-time and sandwich course
students and about 246,000 part-time students follow courses at a variety of
institutions.
The expansion was achieved by creating new universities; by developing a
number of colleges into universities; and by establishing 30 polytechnics also
specialising in advanced work. Colleges of education specialising in teacher
training also experienced rapid expansion but, more recently, because of the
fall in pupil numbers, some of these have been closed while many have been
amalgamated with other colleges leading, in some cases, to the development of
institutes or colleges of higher education providing a range of courses.
The number of students taking full-time and sandwich courses (excluding
teacher training) is evenly divided between science-based and arts-based
courses; although this is not a matter for explicit government policy, it has
been the subject of much public discussion.
There are 45 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945.
The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath, Birmingham,
Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London), Durham,
East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, New¬
castle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, South¬
ampton, Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, and York. The London Graduate School
of Business Studies and the ^Manchester Business School also have university
status. The federated University of Wales includes five university colleges, the
\\ elsh National School of Medicine, and the University of Wales Institute of
Science and Technology. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling, and
EDUCATION 165
Strathclyde (Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there are the Queen’s University
of Belfast, and the New University of Ulster in Coleraine.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination or by selection. Prospective
candidates for nearly all the universities apply for places through the Univer¬
sities Central Council on Admissions. The only students to apply directly are
applicants to the Open University and British candidates who apply only to the
universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
Most students at universities are undergraduates: in 1978-79 there were
about 288,000 full-time university students in Britain, including over 49,000
postgraduates. Just under a half lived in colleges and halls of residence, over
one-third were in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder lived at
home. There were about 32,700 full-time university teachers paid wholly from
university funds. The ratio of staff to students was about one to nine, one of the
most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first-degree courses are mainly full-time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses usually
require five or six. In spite of the extension of facilities for obtaining a degree in
other ways the majority of students on full-time first-degree courses are at
universities (the non-university sector offers a variety of other higher-
education courses besides degrees).
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university; in
England and Wales the most common titles for a first degree are Bachelor of
Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA), Master of Science (MSc), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD); while in
Scotland Master is occasionally used for a first degree in arts subjects. On the
other hand, uniformity of standards between universities is promoted by the
practice of employing outside examiners for all university examinations, and
the general pattern of teaching (a combination of lectures, small group semi¬
nars or tutorials with practical classes where necessary) is fairly similar
throughout Britain.
In addition to the universities, there is the University College at Bucking¬
ham which opened in 1976 and which receives no assistance from public funds.
It does not yet award degrees, but its Licence has been accepted as the
equivalent of a degree by relevant professional bodies and by other universities
for admission to postgraduate studies.
The Open
U Hirer sity
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degrees and other courses, using a combination of television and radio broad¬
casts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a network of
viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are required
to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the same as
those of other universities. The university’s first degree, the BA (Open), is a
general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course completed; the
average amount of study needed for a full course is estimated at 12 to 14 hours a
week. The first courses began in 1971, and in 1980 some 65,000 undergraduate
and over 20,000 associate students were following courses. About 5,400 people
a year obtain degrees from the Open University—about 1 in 16 of the total for
Britain. The university has advised many other countries on the setting-up of
similar institutions.

Teacher Training
Other Advanced
Courses
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In order to teach in a maintained school in England and Wales all new entrants
to teaching must generally have taken a recognised course of teacher training.
Courses are offered by most universities and by a number of polytechnics and
other institutions of higher education. The most usual route to a teaching
qualification for non-graduates is by way of a three- or four-year course leading
to the Bachelor of Education degree; graduates qualify by taking a one-year
postgraduate Certificate of Education course.
In response to the change in demand for newly trained teachers, caused by
restrictions on public expenditure and the decline in the size of the school
population, the number of training places planned for 1981 has been consider¬
ably cut. However, because of a shortage of qualified teachers of mathematics,
science, craft, design and technology and business studies, special financial
arrangements are being offered to encourage suitably qualified mature people
to undertake one-year training courses to enter the profession.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools
must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland and all
teachers of academic subjects in secondary schools must be graduates. Train¬
ing capacity has also been reduced in response to demographic trends but is
being maintained in the colleges of education established for this purpose.
Courses lead to the award of a Teaching Qualification (Primary Education or
Secondary Education). Graduates and holders of specialist diplomas take a
one-year course; courses in practical and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates
extend to two, three or four years. Most Scottish colleges of education also
offer four-year courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Education.
In Northern Ireland teacher training takes place in the two university
education departments, three colleges of education, the Ulster Polytechnic and
one technical college. The principal courses are the certificate (three years of
study) and the Bachelor of Education (four years) but there are also one-year
courses for graduates or holders of other appropriate qualifications.
Increased importance is being given to the continued professional training of
practising teachers, and local authorities, universities and colleges provide a
variety of in-service courses.
In 1978-79 about 388,000 students, including part-time students, were taking
advanced courses other than in universities in a wide variety of subjects,
including architecture, art and design, catering, engineering, natural sciences,
social work, business and management studies and teacher training. An
increasing proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the awards
of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council awards
degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in standard with those
granted by universities, to students who successfully complete approved
courses of study in establishments which do not award their own degrees. The
courses range from science and technology to the arts, social studies, business
studies and law, but the proportion of technological, business or other broadly
vocational courses is much higher than in universities.
In England and Wales a major contribution to higher education provision is
being made by 30 major national institutions named polytechnics. These
provide all types of courses (full-time, sandwich and part-time) on a wide range
of subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a concentration on
advanced work. In Scotland similar provision is made in 14 central insti¬
tutions and a few further education colleges managed by education authorities,
though there is a tendency for the Scottish establishments to specialise in
particular subjects to a greater extent than the English polytechnics. In
Vocational
Courses
Adult
Education
EDUCATION 167
Northern Ireland such higher education provision is concentrated within the
Ulster Polytechnic.
The institutes and colleges of higher education, formed as the result of the
integration of teacher training with the rest of higher education, account for a
significant proportion of higher education students, and other further educa¬
tion colleges run some, usually specialised, higher education courses.
The British education systems offer facilities for obtaining all types of voca¬
tional education and training, to both school leavers and adults, and are notable
for providing alternative routes to higher qualifications for those who were
unable to continue full-time education after leaving school.
Many broadly vocational educational courses are available at the polytech¬
nics and the 800 or so further and higher education colleges. Some university
courses have always had close links with certain industries and professions and
these links have grown.
There is a wide variety of courses for people in various trades and occu¬
pations, leading to nationally recognised qualifications at the end of courses of
up to five years. At technician level the Technician Education Council (TEC)
has responsibility for developing a unified system of courses in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland and courses leading to TEC certificates and diplomas
and higher certificates and diplomas are replacing those formerly available.
(TEC higher diplomas approach the standard of a pass degree.) A similar
council has been established in Scotland.
Many further education colleges offer courses in shorthand, typing, book¬
keeping, and office studies. More advanced business studies are generally
available in polytechnics and some other colleges. The further education sector
makes a major contribution to management education at all levels (for
example, courses for the postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies
for those with experience of the work are run by about 75 colleges) and this
work in England and Wales is co-ordinated by 12 regional management
centres.
Much business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies, and courses leading to them are provided
in many colleges, although numbers of candidates seeking such qualifications
do so through correspondence courses. There is a Business Education Council
with the same functions as the Technician Education Council (see above) in
relation to courses of business education. In Scotland, similar courses lead to
the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Higher National Certificate and
the Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies, awarded by the Scottish
Business Education Council.
There is increasing recognition that school and even immediately post-school
education cannot provide for everyone’s needs throughout life, and growing
emphasis is put on opportunities for adults to take up both vocational and
general education and training. ‘Adult education’ is a broad term, ranging from
the development of the special skills required by rapid change in industry and
technology to ‘self-fulfilment’ through a very wide range of courses. An
important element is remedial, allowing people to make up for opportunities
missed at school; the adult literacy campaign and programmes to help mem¬
bers of minority ethnic groups are particular examples. Courses are provided
by local education authorities, residential colleges, extra-mural departments of
universities, the Open University and various other bodies including a number
of voluntary organisations. In England and Wales an Advisory Council for

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Adult and Continuing Education aims to promote the effective use of resources
and consider future policies and priorities; in Scotland a similar function is
performed by the Scottish Council for Community Education.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities and
provided mainly in their establishments, including schools used for adult
evening classes and in some cases in ‘community schools’ which provide
educational, social and cultural opportunities for the wider community. Most
courses are part time. In addition local authorities maintain or aid most of the
short-term residential colleges or centres (45 in England and Wales) which
provide courses lasting between a weekend and a fortnight. Many courses are
practical, but there are widespread opportunities for academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (seven in England and Wales, one in Scot¬
land), grant-aided by central government departments, provide courses of one
or two years. They aim to provide a liberal education without academic entry
tests. Most students admitted are entitled to full maintenance grants.
University extra-mural departments and the Workers’ Educational Associa¬
tion (WEA), the largest recognised voluntary body, provide extended part-
time courses of more academic studies, though recently the number of
short courses organised for special (including vocational) interests has
increased. Often the WEA provides the organisation and the universities the
tutors.
Many other organisations, national and local, provide many kinds of
education and training. Several, such as the National Federation of Women’s
Institutes and the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations,
receive government grants; others are commercially or privately financed.
Some are open to the public as a whole, others to a particular group, such as the
disabled or the unemployed, or the employees or members of an organisation.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations in
England and Wales. It is mainly financed by contributions from local educa¬
tion authorities and assisted by a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. The Institute has a government-funded adult literacy and basic skills
unit which covers proficiency in areas such as numeracy and communication,
as well as literacy, without which people are impeded in applying or being
considered for employment. The Institute’s counterpart in Scotland is the
Scottish Institute of Adult Education.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses at univer¬
sities and colleges remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested
reading, seminars or tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate,
practical work. Modern educational aids, including computers, language
laboratories, radio and television for both teaching and research, are widely
available at most universities, polytechnics and colleges.
Radio and television programmes, both specifically educational and general,
are important media for continuing education and are often linked to a range of
supplementary publications, courses and activities. BBC radio study pro¬
grammes are transmitted in half-hour sessions late at night on weekdays and in
a four-hour session on Sunday afternoons. Educational television programmes
are shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings, during the day on weekdays
with some early and late evening transmissions. Both the BBC and indepen¬
dent television provide programmes which range from basic education and
progressive vocational training to domestic, social and craft skills. The BBC

also works with the Open University (see p 165), producing and broadcasting
radio and television programmes as part of the courses.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by the central government educa¬
tion departments, local education authorities, philanthropic organisations,
universities and teachers associations. Some research is also sponsored at
further education institutions and by a few independent organisations. The
Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are important chan¬
nels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the univer¬
sities, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and
Wales, an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from funds
received from research projects and from corporate members, including local
education authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities. It receives an
annual grant from the Department of Education and Science. There are also
the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland
Council for Educational Research.
The interchange of ideas and the movement of people between different
countries is an important part of education. School children, students,
teachers and experts come to Britain from overseas to study and British people
work and train overseas. Many opportunities for such movement are the result
of international co-operation at government level within the European Com¬
munity and within the Commonwealth and of educational schemes, courses
and professional contacts organised by official and voluntary organisations in
Britain. The British aid programme also encourages links between educational
institutions in Britain and in developing countries.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer ties with
other countries. Both in schools and in the colleges and universities there has
been an expansion of interest in European studies and languages. Post-to-post
exchange of teachers have been encouraged and exchanges take place between
school children and students within the Community. Britain has adhered to
the Statute of the European Schools (nine of which have been established
throughout the Community including one at Culham, Oxfordshire) to provide
school education for children of people employed in Community institutions.
Three aspects of education being given particular attention within the
Community are foreign language learning, the language and other educational
needs of migrants and their children, and the relationship between education
and working life. In addition, studies are being made of policies of admission to
higher education in member countries.
The promotion of cultural and educational relations with other countries is a
major concern of the British Council (see p 71), which plays an important part
in the management of the British aid programme to education. It recruits
teachers for work overseas, organises short visits overseas by British experts
and encourages cultural exchange visits. The Council is also responsible for a
variety of schemes to promote academic interchange including the Academic
Links Scheme between universities and higher education institutions in
Britain and Europe; the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme; the
Academic Interchange with Europe Scheme; the Young Research Workers
Interchange Scheme; and a number of schemes to encourage exchange
between Britain and individual countries overseas.
I7° BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges is an independent
foundation financed by the Government which has considerable experience
over the whole range of educational travel and exchange. It is responsible, with |
the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers, for the schemes for
the exchange and interchange of teachers with a number of foreign and |
Commonwealth countries; and for the linking of British schools and local
education authorities and their overseas counterparts. The resulting visits and
exchanges have been largely related to the teaching of modern languages, but
other areas of the curriculum have been involved. The Bureau’s publications
include a series of annual guides on visits to other countries for students and
teachers and a journal published each term, called Educational Exchange.
The Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, funded from
the official aid programme, encourages co-operation between universities in
developing countries and in Britain. It assists with staff recruitment, second¬
ment of staff from British universities, inter-departmental/faculty link
schemes, local staff development, short-term teaching and advisory visits and
general consultative services.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities promotes co-operation
between 222 member universities in 28 Commonwealth countries. It organises
meetings of various kinds; provides information (see Bibliography) and
academic appointments services; administers the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan in Britain; and generally promotes the movement of
academic and administrative staff and of students from one country to another.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The
United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body
serving overseas students and organisations and individuals concerned in
student affairs.
Overseas Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
Students in universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In the
Britain academic year 1978-79 there were about 86,500 students in publicly main¬
tained institutions, some 36,800 at univerisities and about 49,700 at further
education establishments. In addition, others (around 38,000 in 1977-78)
were training as nurses, for the law, banking and accountancy, for industry or
services. About 43 per cent of all overseas students were from the Common¬
wealth and 79 per cent from developing countries.
Many of those who come to Britain do so for advanced training. Of the
50,000 students enrolled for full-time postgraduate study or research at British
universities in 1978, 38 per cent came from overseas. Of those working for a
master’s degree 46 per cent came from overseas and of those working for a
doctorate 35 per cent. British universities, polytechnics and other further
education establishments have built up their reputation overseas by providing
tuition of the highest standards, maintaining low staff to student ratios, and
adopting courses and qualifications to meet present-day and possible future
needs. First degree courses tend to be shorter in Britain than overseas (three
years is the average length).
The majority of overseas students pay their own fees and expenses or hold
awards from their own governments. In addition, over 5,700 overseas
students were fully supported in 1979 under British technical co-operation
with developing countries. From the academic year 1980-81 new students
from overseas in higher and further education have to meet the full cost of their
tuition, but students from other member countries of the European

Community are charged the lower level tuition fees that apply to British
students. There is, however, a scheme to provide financial help for overseas
research students of high ability to attend universities.
A range of public and private scholarships and fellowships are available to
students from overseas (and to British students who want to study overseas).
Among the best known are the British Council Scholarships, the Common¬
wealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the Marshall Scholarships and the
independently funded Rhodes Scholarships, and the Churchill Scholarships
for men and women in all walks of life. Many British universities and colleges
offer scholarships for which graduates of any nationality are eligible. (The
British Council and the Association of Commonwealth Universities are
involved in the selection of British students for awards offered by many
overseas countries.) The Atlantic College at St. Donat’s, south Wales (one of
the colleges of the United World Colleges), provides two-year residential
courses for overseas students prior to their entering university.
The continuing increase in interest in English as a foreign language is reflected
in the growth of the number of private language schools and the greater
proportion of these recognised as efficient after inspection by the Department
of Education and Science in collaboration with the British Council. Much of
this demand is for English needed for specific educational or vocational pur¬
poses. At the same time the British Council has greatly expanded the volume of
its own teaching of English overseas by opening new centres in many countries
and extending existing ones. Publications and other material relating to
English language teaching have also increased in number and are now a large
component in publishers’ lists and constitute a major export.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service provides a worldwide
facility for the individual learner in his or her own home.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to promote the social and informal education of
young people by offering them opportunities in their leisure time to mix
socially and to develop and enlarge their range of interests. The service is
provided by a partnership between public authorities and a large variety of
voluntary organisations. Membership of groups is voluntary and there is no
attempt to create anything in the nature of a national youth movement.
The youth service forms part of the education system. Government education
departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service and encourage
their achievement through financial assistance and advice. They assist national
and local voluntary youth organisations through grants towards administrative
and building costs. The Scottish Education Department is advised by the
Scottish Council for Community Education while in Northern Ireland the
advisory body is the Youth Committee for Northern Ireland.
Local education authorities (education and library boards in Northern
Ireland) are responsible for local administration of the youth service.
Authorities provide and run their own youth clubs and centres (some of which
are residential) which may be purpose-built or associated with schools. They
also assist local voluntary youth groups by lending premises and equipment
and by contributing to their capital and running costs. Many authorities
have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary bodies
are represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate youth

work and to arrange in-service training. In Scotland these committees and
organisers are normally concerned with services for both young people
and adults.
Although there are many local education authority youth clubs and centres,
national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of youth |
activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day running
expenses by their own efforts. These have an estimated combined membership
of over 6 million. They vary greatly in character, some concentrating on social
and recreational pursuits, others on educational or religious activities. Most of
the national organisations in England are members of the National Council of
Voluntary Youth Services, a consultative body which takes action in the name
of its member bodies. The Council has 65 national organisations and 47 local
co-ordinating bodies as members. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
there are similar representative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations in membership of
the National Council are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about
542,000 and 859,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs
(about 500,000), the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 162,000) and
the Youth Hostels Association (about 293,000). The three pre-service organ¬
isations (the Combined Cadet Force, Army Cadet Force and Air Training
Corps) are observer members. They are financially assisted by the Ministry of
Defence and combine social, educational and physical development with
training for possible entry to the armed forces.
There are some 3,000 full-time youth workers in Britain and these are sup¬
ported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but
some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number
attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school teachers
are recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and
community workers. Provided at certain universities and higher education
colleges, the course leads to the status of a qualified youth and community
worker. In addition a number of colleges of higher education provide a study of
youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject within teacher-training courses.
In Scotland one- and three-year courses are provided at certain colleges of
education and in Northern Ireland courses are provided by the Ulster
Polytechnic.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies such
as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is a
challenge for young people from Britain and other Commonwealth countries to
reach certain standards in leisure-time activities with the voluntary assistance
of adults. The scheme celebrates its 25th anniversary in 1981.
A substantial sum of money is awarded by the many grant-giving founda¬
tions and trusts each year for activities involving young people.
The Royal Jubilee Trusts, formed in 1978 from King George’s Jubilee
Trust (started in 1935 at the time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V) and
the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust (which arose from the 1977 Queen’s Silver
Jubilee Appeal) exist to support work involving young people aged 8 to 18
(King George’s Jubilee Trust) and young people up to the age of 25 involved in
community service work (the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust). King George’s

Jubilee Trust has distributed over £3-75 million since 1935 and the Queen’s
Silver Jubilee Trust over £4-38 million since May 1978.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service
designed to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled.
Organisations providing opportunities for community service such as Interna¬
tional Voluntary Service, Task Force and Community Service Volunteers
receive grants from the Government. Many schools also organise community
service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Community Projects Foundation is an independent body which advises
interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving young
people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-aided
by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available on
request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in promoting voluntary service.
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has had
considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry, com¬
merce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing
environmental pollution. There is no ‘national plan’ for urban and land
development, but there is a statutory system of land-use planning applying over
the whole country and to virtually every kind of development, and there are
laws dealing specifically with environmental health and the control of pollu¬
tion. All development requires local ‘planning permission’, and applications
for permission are dealt with in the light of development plans which set out
strategies for each area on such matters as housing, transport, industry and
open land. The underlying approach is to identify people’s needs and possible
ways of meeting them, and there is a growing move away from narrow land-use
allocation towards broader strategic planning recognising the community’s
social and economic goals. Throughout Britain voluntary organisations, too,
take an active interest in planning, conversation and the control of pollution.
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and
Scotland, and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England for land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Develop¬
ment Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Large-scale plan¬
ning in England and Wales is primarily the responsibility of the county
councils and the Greater London Council while district councils and the
councils of the London boroughs and the City of London are responsible for
most local plans and development control, the main housing functions and
many other environmental health matters. In Scotland, planning functions are
undertaken by regional and district councils whose responsibilities are divided
on a basis broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the more rural
regions and the islands, all planning responsibilities are carried out by the
regional and islands councils respectively. In Northern Ireland the Depart¬
ment of the Environment for Northern Ireland is responsible for planning
matters through its local offices which work closely with the district councils.
The councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of major industry (see p 226). General problems
of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of government
departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires the local
planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives from the Government
encourage the location of industry in particular areas.
Development
Plans and
Development
Control
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’ and
‘local’ plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities and
require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the development
and other use of land (including measures for the improvement of the physical
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT 175
environment and traffic management) and indicate ‘action areas’ where com¬
prehensive development or improvement is expected to start within a specified
period. Local plans, which have to conform generally with the structure plan,
contain detailed proposals including plans for ‘action areas’ and are normally
prepared by district councils, though sometimes by county councils. Local
plans are adopted by the planning authorities without being subject to
ministerial approval unless the Secretary of State calls in a plan for his own
decision. All plans are under continuous review and may be altered from time
to time. Scotland has a similar system which can also include the production
of a regional report by regional and island authorities, outlining their
broad priorities and policies. In Northern Ireland there is a single-tier system;
plans are prepared by the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative stages
of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must ensure
adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans; representa¬
tions may be made about them to the authorities. These opportunities for
public participation are additional to provisions for objecting to prepared
plans. In the case of structure plans the Secretary of State holds an examination
in public of matters on which he requires more information in order to reach a
decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be heard, and a
public local inquiry is normally held by the planning authorities.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. The applicant has a right of appeal to the
appropriate Secretary of State if planning permission is refused or granted
subject to conditions. Most appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors
(in Scotland reporters) appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred
to him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in
respect of proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has
the right to be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a
public inquiry is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development
schemes of national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific
nature, and if an ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers
responsible may decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out
investigations and hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is pro¬
posed, the government minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he
considers appropriate.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of objections. There is a right of appeal to
an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
Regional
Planning
For many administrative purposes England is divided into eight regions:
Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South
East, South West, West Midlands and North West. Each has a regional board
consisting of civil servants who are normally the senior representatives in the
regional offices of government departments. The chairmen of the boards are
the regional directors of the Departments of the Environment and Transport.
The main task of the boards is to provide for the co-ordination of inter-
iy6
New Towns

departmental activities; they also keep in touch with bodies such as local
authorities and the regional councils of the Trades Union Congress and the
Confederation of British Industry.
Scotland has an Economic Council chaired by the Secretary of State for
Scotland which provides a forum for discussion of all aspects of Scottish
economic development; members are appointed by the Secretary of State in
a personal capacity. There is also a Scottish Economic Planning Board. In
Wales there is an Economic Planning Board with a role similar to that of the
regional boards in England. The Northern Ireland Economic Council, an
independent body appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
provides the Government with advice on all aspects of economic policy in the
Province. It represents trade unions, employers’ organisations and independ¬
ent interests.
Since 1946, 32 new towns have been designated and they represent one of the
most successful achievements of recent British planning. Of these, most of
which had as a nucleus an existing town or village, 21 are in England, 2 in
Wales, 5 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland. The policy behind their
creation was mainly one of encouraging the gradual dispersal of industry and
population from congested cities to new areas, planned in advance to become
self-contained towns with services and amenities within convenient distance of
the whole community.
A government review of the new towns policy, undertaken against a back¬
ground of substantial reductions in population forecasts and a need to pay more
attention to the regeneration of declining inner city areas (see p 177), has led to
a reduction in the long-term target populations of some towns. The momen¬
tum of new town development is to be substantially maintained, however, over
the next few years.
The planning and growth of each new town is supervised by a govern¬
ment-appointed development corporation which is given general powers to
acquire, by compulsory purchase if necessary, land or property needed for the
provision of houses, factories and other buildings and for roads and essential
services.
In England four of the new towns have been substantially completed and the
development corporations dissolved. Target dates for the dissolution of a
further eight new towns development corporations by the early 1980s have
been announced. In Wales responsibility for one of the two new towns has been
taken over by the Development Board for Rural Wales. In Northern Ireland,
development of the new towns has been incorporated in a new District Towns
Strategy which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
The capital cost is advanced from public funds and is repayable over 60
years. Parliament has approved a fund to provide for advances to the develop¬
ment corporations, which, for Great Britain, stands at £3,250 million (net of
repayments). The Government plans substantial disposals of the completed
assets of the new towns in order to release resources for investment and to
reduce the involvement of the public sector.
The new towns have a total population of over 2 million. Young people
form a somewhat higher proportion than in the population of the country as
a whole. Several of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres
and, as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support,
offices, hotels and department stores, as well as art centres and full
entertainment and recreational facilities, are gradually being provided.
Inner City
Policies
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT 177
The new towns programme has included the expansion of large existing
towns such as Northampton, Peterborough and Warrington; this has the
advantage, among others, that many facilities are already available.
Town development (or ‘expanding town’) schemes involve the transfer of
people and industry from overcrowded areas to existing towns suitable for
expansion; these are arranged directly between the local authorities of the
towns concerned. Most of the towns expanded under these schemes (for
example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and Thetford) are well established
and are providing homes, jobs and amenities for people from large cities.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities presents one of the most
important challenges to modern British planning. Past policies have produced
many successes (most of the slums have been replaced, much old housing has
been improved and the clean air legislation has enhanced the general environ¬
ment and public health) but some of the problems associated with poor
housing have still to be overcome. In many areas they have been joined by
problems of high unemployment, decay and dereliction and unbalanced popu¬
lation structures with relatively high proportions of the elderly and the disad¬
vantaged. The extent of these problems varies from place to place, and the
inter-relationship between them is complex. Government policy is not to seek a
universal solution but to work out for each city the package of measures that is
most likely to improve conditions and to encourage, as far as possible, local
voluntary action.
Greater resources and priority have been given to the inner city areas. The
Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 gave powers to selected inner city local authorities
to support the creation of new employment opportunities and to improve the
environment of industrial areas. The urban aid programme has been increased
from a 1977-78 level in England and Wales of under £30 million a year to £206
million a year in 1980—81 (in Scotland from about £6 million a year to £20
million a year by 1980-81). The programme traditionally complemented the
work of major social programmes by providing extra facilities which would
otherwise not have been available, such as day nurseries, centres for the elderly
and language classes for immigrants, but has been recast so as to cover
industrial, commercial, environmental and recreational provision as well. The
urban programme represents only a small part of the central assistance to
urban, and other, local authorities. The main contribution is through the
annual ‘rate support’ grant, transport supplementary grant (in England and
Wales only), housing subsidy and other programmes. The Government also
approved some £64 million for a special programme of inner city construction
work between 1977 and 1980.
In certain places, special schemes are in operation. A co-ordinated ‘partner¬
ship’ approach has been adopted in seven English areas whereby central and
local government work together to tackle places where the problems are
greatest. Each partnership has a three-year action programme rolled forward
annually, which is based on the needs of the area and its particular priorities.
Partnerships receive allocations of urban programme resources ranging from
£8 million to £25 million a year. To meet the particular problems and oppor¬
tunities of the London docklands and the Merseyside dock area the Govern¬
ment has set up urban development corporations, modelled on the new town
development corporations. Elsewhere in England 15 areas have been identified
where the problems are on a slightly smaller scale but still merit special
attention. These areas prepare their own inner city programmes and like the
partnerships receive special allocations of urban programme resources. Addi-

tional resources are also made available to a further 14 English and five Welsh
districts designated under the Inner Urban Areas Act.
In Scotland a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the
city’s east end is organised on somewhat similar lines to the partnership areas in
England, and a further eight Scottish districts have been designated under the
Inner Urban Areas Act. In Northern Ireland a special effort is being made to
tackle Belfast’s inner city problems.
The Government proposes to establish seven ‘enterprise zones’ (in London’s
Docklands, Swansea, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne,
Clydebank and Belfast) to bring new life to areas of urban decay. Each zone, to
be designated initially for ten years, will cover up to 200 hectares (500 acres)
and will be granted concessions and exemptions on rates, taxation, planning
procedures and certain standard governmental requirements. Additional
zones will be designated later.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; over 300,000 buildings
are already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any
listed building without special consent from the local planning authority
or the appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a
building, the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England)
and similar bodies for Scotland and Wales have an opportunity to make a
photographic record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation
notices can be served by the local planning authority to protect buildings
not yet listed.
The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the appro¬
priate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the repair or
maintenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding interest, and
local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or
historic interest even if it is not listed. The Architectural Heritage Fund,
voluntary contributions to which are matched by the Government, provides
loans for local historic buildings trusts.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection over 4,800
'conservation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works for the preservation or enhancement of outstand¬
ing conservation areas.
The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protec¬
tion of ancient monuments of which about 800 are in their care. The Ancient
Monument Boards recommend which monuments are considered to be of
national importance and therefore worthy of preservation.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland is responsible for the protection of historic monuments, of which 149
are in their care. The Department, acting on the advice of the Historic
Buildings Council, is also responsible for the listing of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest, for the designation of conservation areas, and
for the payment of grants.
The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands in
the interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting of trees.
Green Belts
The Coast
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT 179
Landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’ trees which die or are
removed or destroyed in contravention of a preservation order.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where people can seek recreation) have been established or
proposed on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London’s green belt,
for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which is used for
recreation. There are also areas specifically for recreational use, such as
country parks, public open spaces, playing fields and golf courses.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of scien¬
tific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken
by the Countryside Commission (see p 180) in 1966-70, recommended that
certain stretches of undeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. There is a practical programme aimed at the designa¬
tion of 42 such coasts which together would cover over 1,300 kilometres (808
miles), some 40 per cent of the undeveloped coastline. Jointly with local
authorities, the Commission has defined 34 of these coasts so far, protecting
just over 1,000 kilometres (621 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust (see p 188) launched its Enterprise Neptune
campaign to raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. More than £4 million has been raised so
far and as a result the Trust has under its protection 644 kilometres (400 miles)
of coastline in England and Wales. Some 127 kilometres (79 miles) of coast in
Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with the National Trust for
Scotland. In Northern Ireland 56 kilometres (35 miles) of coast and coastal
path have been acquired.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; develop¬
ment associated with North Sea oil and gas is occurring on remote and
unspoiled coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but planning guidelines
drawn up by the Scottish Development Department aim to ensure that oil-
related activities are sited so as to make the best use of existing labour and
infrastructure and to minimise the effect on the coastline. Provision has also
been made for funds to be set aside for the restoration of sites once there is no
further need for them.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department of
the Environment, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and
heavy costs for the maritime local authorities. All coast protection schemes
drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949 are investi¬
gated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from central funds
(up to a maximum of 79 per cent) may be made to the authorities. Protection
against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the primary
responsibility of the water authorities (see pp 283 and 294). To help to prevent
the pollution of the sea and coastline, international conventions restrict the
discharge of oil into the sea (see p 185).

The display of outdoor advertisements is controlled by planning legislation.
General consents have been issued for certain classes of advertisement but
these can be withdrawn in particular cases where there is a serious threat to
amenity or public safety. Consent for advertisements outside these classes
must be sought from the local planning authority. Rural areas and urban areas
requiring special protection can be designated as areas of special control which
impose more restrictive standards.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for encouraging and promoting measures to conserve
and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and for
encouraging the development of facilities for open-air recreation in the
countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (sometimes in
association with other bodies) and private individuals of country parks and
picnic sites often within easy reach of towns; the provision or improvement of
recreational paths; the establishment of transit caravan and camping sites; the
encouragement of amenity tree-planting schemes; and the increased use of
reservoirs, canals and other waterways for bathing, sailing and other activities.
Some 150 country parks and 200 picnic sites have been recognised in England
and Wales by the Countryside Commission. In Scotland a large number of
local authority schemes for the provision of a variety of countryside facilities
have been approved for grant aid. The Commissions may undertake research
projects and experimental schemes, working in consultation with local
authorities and such bodies as the Nature Conservancy Council (see p 182) and
the Sports Councils (see p 428). In England and Wales, the Countryside
Commission may give financial assistance to public bodies and individuals
carrying out countryside recreation and amenity projects. Attention is increas¬
ingly being given to small-scale amenity tree-planting and to techniques of
countryside management to supplement the statutory planning controls.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’; to define heritage coasts in conjunction
with local authorities (see p 179); and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover some 13,600 sq km (5,250 square
miles), or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is the
responsibility of special committees or planning boards which carry out all or
most of the planning functions. Some 33 areas of outstanding natural beauty
have been designated, covering some 14,500 sq km (5,600 square miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and the
removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit of the
public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas, and
information centres. All national parks and some other designated areas have
warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national parks is met by
central government grants. Some 2,528 km (1,580 miles) of long-distance
Forest Parks
Local
Footpaths and

PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT l8l
footpaths and bridleways have been approved. Large stretches of these paths
are already public rights of way.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises on the
preservation of amenities and the designation of areas of outstanding natural
beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural beauty have been designated and six
areas are being managed as country parks and one as a regional park.
In Scotland there are no national parks as such, but there are 40 ‘national
scenic areas’ where certain kinds of development are subject to consultation
with and advice from the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and the
Secretary of State for Scotland, in the event of a disagreement.
The Forestry Commission (see p 301) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll,
Galloway, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. They cover some 243,000 hectares (600,000 acres), and
camping and other recreational facilities are provided in all of them. The
historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a forest park, is also open to
the public. The Forestry Commission and Hampshire County Council jointly
manage the Queen Elizabeth Country Park in Hampshire. In addition the
Forestry Commission welcomes the public to much of the land under its
management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has estab¬
lished six forest parks (Tollymore, Castlewellan, Gortin Glen, Drum Manor,
Gosford and Glenariff) and there are also forest scenic drives and many
recreational facilities in these and other forests.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare definitive maps
showing all public rights of way, which must be kept free of obstruction. If a
path is not shown on the map, a private citizen may claim that it is a public right
of way if it has been used and regarded as such without hindrance for at least 20
years. Public footpaths are maintained by local authorities who must also
provide signposts and supervise landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates.
Local authorities in Great Britain can create paths, close existing paths no
longer needed for public use and divert paths to secure either a shorter route or
the efficient use of land. Local planning authorities can also convert minor
roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve the amenities of their area.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, although many
landowners permit such access more or less freely. Local planning authorities
can secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements
cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public
access. Similar powers cover Scotland, while the introduction of comparable
legislation is under consideration in Northern Ireland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1-5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries of
State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act 1965
provided for the registration of all commons and village greens. Under the
Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities for enjoyment on
any common land to which the public has access.

Nature
Conservation
Land
Reclamation
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council which has the functions of establishing, main¬
taining and managing nature reserves, advising ministers, providing general
information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research. There are
some 167 national nature reserves covering 132,600 hectares (327,700 acres).
Some 3,700 sites of special scientific interest have been scheduled because of
their flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features.
About 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of Forestry Commission land are
managed as areas in which nature conservation is the main object. Local
authorities have declared more than 60 nature reserves, and voluntary
organisations, which play an important part in protecting wildlife, have estab¬
lished nearly 1,100 reserves.
In Northern Ireland the Nature Reserves Committee advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment for Northern Ireland on the designation of nature
reserves and areas of scientific interest; there are 34 and 46 respectively.
Derelict land, often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth century
industrial development, presents special problems to planners. It includes
mineral waste tips, old mineral workings, obsolete industrial buildings and
disused railways and docks. In England most derelict land reclamation is
undertaken, with the help of central government grant, by local authorities,
who have the power to acquire derelict land and bring it back into use or
improve its appearance. Mainly as a result of government encouragement,
local authorities have shown an increasing interest in reclaiming derelict land,
and greater emphasis is being placed on grant assistance for the reclamation of
derelict land in urban areas for industrial and other development. There are
proposals to extend the scope and flexibility of the grant scheme to promote
this new emphasis.
In Scotland and Wales responsibility for derelict land reclamation rests with
the respective development agencies, who may acquire land and reclaim it
themselves, employ local authorities as their agents (in Scotland) or
make grants to local authorities for the purpose (in Wales). In Northern
Ireland grants are paid to landowners who restore or improve derelict
sites.
To prevent new dereliction, planning controls require that when permission
is given for mineral working various measures must be taken to minimise the
disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restoration is practic¬
able, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of land for disposal
of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting height or requiring
treatment on completion.
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
Government measures to control environmental pollution, in which industry
and voluntary organisations co-operate, are long established, and are seen as
complementary to the planning system and the various measures to conserve
amenities and the country’s heritage.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to England, Scotland and
Wales provides a comprehensive framework to tackle pollution problems. It
extends a wide range of new powers and duties to local and water authorities,
increases their powers to deal with controlled wastes, air and water pollution
and noise, and contains important provisions on the release of information to
the public on environmental conditions. In particular, the provisions dealing
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT 183
with waste on land institute a new system for the comprehensive planning of
waste disposal operations so as to ensure that disposal is carried out to satisfac¬
tory standards and that the best use is made of waste materials. The Act also
increases the penalties for a large number of pollution offences. The provisions
relating to noise and air pollution are fully in force, as are a substantial number
of those relating to waste on land, but most of the part which deals with water
pollution has not yet been brought into effect. Similar legislation applies in
Northern Ireland.
Administration Responsibility for the control of pollution is shared by various central govern¬
ment departments, local and water authorities and statutory agencies. Indus¬
try co-operates with these authorities and voluntary organisations help to focus
public interest on the process of control. An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution advises the Government on national
and international matters concerning the pollution of the environment, on the
adequacy of research and on the future possibilities of danger to the environ¬
ment. In England and Wales the Secretary of State for the Environment has a
co-ordinating role concerning pollution matters as a whole, exercised through a
Central Directorate on Environmental Pollution within his department, while
an independent Standing Commission on Energy and the Environment pro¬
vides the Government with advice on the inter-action of energy policies and the
environment.
Specific responsibilities of the Department of the Environment in England
include air pollution control, fresh water pollution control, waste disposal,
control of civil radioactive wastes (jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food), of oil and chemicals on beaches and of noise other than
aircraft noise, traffic noise and noise at work. Most of these responsibilities in
Scotland are exercised by the Scottish Development Department, in Wales by
the Welsh Office and in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environ¬
ment for Northern Ireland.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the control of oil pollution at sea
(other than from offshore operations) and its clearance, and for the control of
aircraft noise. The Department of Transport is responsible for policies for the
control of traffic noise. The Department of Energy is responsible for the
control of pollution arising from the exploration for, and exploitation of oil.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agricul¬
ture and Fisheries for Scotland, the Northern Ireland Departments of Agricul¬
ture and the Environment (together with the Health and Safety Executive) are
responsible for the control of agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, for the
protection of fisheries from pollution and for the prevention of food contami¬
nation. The protection of the health of employees at work (see p 341) is the
responsibility of the Department of Employment and is controlled by the
Factory Inspectorate which forms part of the Health and Safety Executive; in
Northern Ireland it is the responsibility of the Department of Manpower
Services. Other departments such as the Department of Education and
Science, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Scottish
Home and Health Department have an interest in health aspects of pollution
control.
Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and disposal
of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from domestic and certain indus¬
trial premises and noise abatement measures. Sewerage and sewage treatment
and disposal are the responsibilities of water authorities in England and Wales,
of local authorities in Scotland and of the Department of the Environment in
184

Northern Ireland. The regional water authorities in England, the Welsh Water
Authority, the river purification boards and islands councils in Scotland and
the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland are responsible for
control of water pollution.
The European Community has adopted a Community Environment Pro¬
gramme as a result of which a number of measures for Community action are
being developed.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, careless disposal of pesticides and chemicals, fall-out of
materials from the atmosphere and the deposition of materials from flood-
water. The application of sewage sludge on farms, too, involves risks as well as
benefits to the land.
The Control of Pollution Act laid a duty on waste disposal authorities
(county councils and the Greater London Council in England, for example) to
ensure that there were adequate arrangements to dispose of controlled wastes
and to draw up and revise periodically a waste disposal plan. It also established
a licensing system for all waste disposal sites, treatment plants and storage
facilities receiving controlled wastes. In addition it provided for a more inten¬
sive control system for certain specially hazardous or difficult wastes.
The Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (PSPS) is a scheme through
which pesticides are cleared for safety before being marketed. Clearance is not
given unless the Government, advised by the Advisory Committee on Pesti¬
cides, is satisfied that a product can be used without risk to people, livestock
and domestic animals, and with minimum harm to wildlife, provided recom¬
mended precautions are taken. The scheme has been extended to include
certain non-agricultural uses of pesticides. The British Agrochemical Supply
Industry Scheme, an independent registration scheme for distributors of crop
protection products, ensures that distributors sell only products which have
been cleared through the PSPS.
Under the Litter Act 1958 it was made an offence to leave litter on land in the
open air to which the public have free access. The Dangerous Litter Act 1971
increased the maximum fine from £10 to £100. Under the Refuse Disposal
(Amenity) Act 1978 the deliberate dumping of rubbish carries a similar
maximum fine with the possibility of a £200 fine and three months’ imprison¬
ment for subsequent offences.
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce imports and waste
disposal costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already
makes considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and
textiles. Local authorities collect about 200,000 tonnes of waste paper annually
and about 100,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap. Waste disposal authorities are
required under the Control of Pollution Act to take full account of oppor¬
tunities for waste reclamation in drawing up their waste disposal plans. Volun¬
tary organisations also organise collections of waste material.
The Government has set up a Waste Management Advisory Council and
launched a National Anti-Waste Programme to co-ordinate policy and promote
opportunities for reclamation and recycling through education and advice.
Extensive Government-supported research and development in this area is in
progress. The Department of the Environment is providing financial and
technical help to South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear County Councils for
full-scale prototype plants for the mechanical sorting of household refuse. The

two plants, at Doncaster and Byker, are in operation. In addition Britain
participates in discussion on waste reclamation and recycling in the European
Community, the OECD and the Economic Commission for Europe.
There has been a steady and significant improvement in water quality: the
level of pollution in the tidal Thames, for example, has been reduced to a
quarter of the 1950s’ level and some 97 different kinds of fish have been
identified there since 1964. Discharges of polluting matter into rivers, lakes,
estuaries and some coastal waters are controlled by law. The Control of
Pollution Act 1974 contains a number of provisions which, when
implemented, will considerably strengthen existing legislation; for example, it
will extend control to all inland water (including specific underground waters)
and all coastal waters within the three-mile limit.
More than 90 per cent of the British population is provided with main
drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works serve over four-fifths of
the population—a very high proportion by international standards.
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international con¬
ventions drawn up under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in
London, and implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, which gave effect to the International
Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954, as
amended in 1962 and 1969, makes it an offence for ships of any nationality to
discharge any oil into British territorial waters and for British registered ships
to discharge persistent oil anywhere at sea, except in accordance with very
stringent regulations. Further amendments to the convention, made in 1971
but not yet in force, relate to the design of tankers and are aimed at reducing the
volume of oil that could escape in the event of an accident. The International
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (as modified by
the 1978 Protocol) will, when in force, replace the 1954 convention by more
stringent requirements and will eventually regulate pollution by chemicals,
sewage and garbage as well as by oil.
The Department of Trade has developed a nationwide organisation using
the resources of its Coastguard and Marine Survey Services, to deal with oil
spills at sea which threaten to cause coastal pollution or are likely to endanger
wildlife. If necessary, action is taken to clear the oil by using low toxicity
dispersant and spraying equipment. Central government and local authorities
have contingency plans under review for dealing with oil and chemical pollu¬
tion of beaches and in inshore waters. Following several oil tanker disasters off
the coasts of Britain and France in 1978, the Government increased expendi¬
ture on contingency arrangements. This included the setting up in 1979
of a Marine Pollution Control Unit within the Department to co-ordinate
contingency arrangements and take charge of operations to deal with pollution
at sea.
The development of the offshore oil industry has brought an increased risk
of oil pollution in the North Sea. Offshore operators are required to ensure that
oil does not escape into the sea and are also expected to have contingency plans
for dealing with oil spills. Not all traces of oil can be removed from water
separated from crude oil before its discharge from production platforms into
the sea, and these discharges from offshore installations are normally granted
exemption from the 1971 Act subject to strict controls laid down by the
Department of Energy. The Department of the Environment, the Welsh
i86
Clean Air
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Office, the Scottish Development Department and the Northern Ireland
Department of the Environment have powers to grant exemptions subject to
similar controls for discharges from land-based sources.
The loading of wastes for dumping at sea by means of vehicles, ships, |
aircraft, hovercraft, marine platforms and conveyor belts is controlled by the I
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office, the Depart- !
ment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland and the Northern Ireland
Department of the Environment through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974 which
gave statutory backing to the voluntary arrangements which had operated for
several years. A licence has to be obtained for the permanent deposit of any
substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at sea is permitted
on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the annexes to the Oslo
Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution
by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the London Convention on
the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter
1972. The 1974 Act does not however control discharges of liquid effluent
from pipelines, which will be covered by the Control of Pollution Act, nor
discharges incidental to or derived from the normal operation of a ship,
aircraft, vehicle, hovercraft or marine structure.
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke
control areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes
an offence. About two-thirds of the premises in the conurbations are now
covered by smoke control orders. Emissions from most industrial premises
are also subject to the control of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts.
The emission of dark smoke from any trade or industrial premises or from the
chimney of any building is in general prohibited, and new furnaces must be
capable as far as practicable of smokeless operation. The height of the j
chimney serving a new furnace must generally be approved by the local
authority, and approved grit and dust arrestment plant has to be installed.
Regulations have been made which prescribe specific limits to the quantities
of grit and dust which may be emitted from certain furnaces. Industrial
premises that give rise to particularly offensive or dangerous emissions are, in
England and Wales, under the control of the Alkali and Clean Air Inspecto¬
rate of the Health and Safety Executive. The Inspectorate requires the best
practicable means to be used to prevent or abate emissions. Similar legisla¬
tion and controls apply in Northern Ireland. Controls are also in force on
emissions from motor vehicles, such as the maximum permitted lead content
of petrol which was reduced from 0-84 grammes per litre in 1973 to °'45
grammes per litre at the beginning of 1978 (and is to be reduced further to
0-40 grammes from 1 January 1981).
Notable progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air and
a better environment, especially in the last 20 years or so. Total emissions and
average concentration of smoke in the air have fallen by nearly 80 per cent since
i960. The domestic smoke control programme has been particularly important
in achieving this result. London no longer experiences the dense smoke-laden
‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in central London winter sunshine has been increasing
since the 1940s when average hours a day were about 40 per cent less than at
Kew in outer London; the levels are now virtually the same. Similar improve¬
ment has been achieved in other cities including Glasgow and Sheffield.
Control measures have reduced urban ground-level concentrations of sulphur
dioxide in Britain by 40 per cent in the last ten years.
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Noise
Radioactivity
187
The control of noise is enforced by local authorities who inspect their areas for
noise nuisances and deal with them. The Control of Pollution Act 1974 (and
similar legislation in Northern Ireland) provides authorities with the power to
control environmental noise from commercial, industrial or domestic prem¬
ises. It also enables them to set up ‘noise abatement zones’ within which they
can require levels of noise from scheduled buildings to be held constant or
reduced, and within which these noise levels may not be increased without
their permission. The Act contains special provisions to control noise from
construction and demolition sites.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and control
measures are aimed at reducing noise at source, through requirements that
aircraft and motor vehicles be quieter, and by protecting people from its
effects. The Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1978 set out
the permissible noise levels for various classes of vehicles when new and when
in use, and further reduction of those levels is under consideration.
Under the Land Compensation Act 1973 compensation is payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors including noise arising from the use
of new or improved public works such as roads and airports. The Act also
enables highway authorities to carry out or make grants for insulation of homes
subject to specified levels of increased noise caused by new or improved roads.
Noise insulation may also be provided where construction work for new roads
is likely seriously to affect nearby homes.
Noise emission levels of most aircraft on the United Kingdom Register of
Civil Aircraft are regulated in accordance with standards agreed by the Inter¬
national Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Subsonic jets acquired by
British operators after September 1978 must already meet the noise certifica¬
tion criteria agreed by ICAO, and all those on the United Kingdom Register
will have to do so from 1 January 1986. Various operational restrictions have
been introduced to reduce noise disturbance further, and people living in the
worst affected areas round a number of airports may be eligible for noise
insulation grants.
In Britain radiation resulting from industrial and other processes represents
only a small fraction of that to which the population is exposed from the
natural environment. Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to stringent con¬
trol because of possible effects on health or longer-term genetic effects.
Under the Radioactive Substances Act i960 users of radioactive materials
other than those subject to licence under the Nuclear Installations Act (see
below) must be registered by the appropriate department, and authorisation
is also required for the disposal of radioactive waste, with exemption for very
minor uses and disposals. The Health and Safety Executive, through its
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned with the grant¬
ing of nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations. No such
installation may be constructed or operated without a licence granted by the
Executive.
The Government is carrying out a review of the existing arrangements
for the control of radioactive waste. Various methods are used for disposing
of it. Most low-level solid waste is buried; intermediate-level solid waste
is mostly stored, with some disposed of at sea; and highly radioactive liquid
waste is stored in tanks while research proceeds on methods of disposal.
The National Radiological Protection Board established under the
Radiological Protection Act 1970 provides an authoritative point of reference
on radiological protection and represents British interests internationally.

VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest
or Natural Beauty (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland), founded in
1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and has 990,000 members. For
the benefit of the public it owns 180,000 hectares (445,000 acres) of land and
protects from harmful development a further 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres).
It owns 240 historic buildings and large stretches of coastline. Properties in
Scotland covering some 33,200 hectares (82,000 acres) are protected by the
National Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded in 1931, which has
over 91,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning and operates a planning aid
service for local amenity groups; while the Royal Town Planning Institute
encourages high standards in town planning. The Civic Trust, established in
1957, encourages the protection and improvement of the environment, and
high standards in architecture and planning and has been closely associated
with the drafting of conservation legislation. It supports and advises over 1,250
local amenity societies. Associate trusts are linked with the Civic Trust in the
north-east and north-west of England, Scotland and Wales.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland
and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the National
Association for Environmental Education; the Keep Britain Tidy Group; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society and the Scottish
Rights of Way Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protec- !
tion of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient Monuments Society; the Georgian
Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Saltire Society (which encour¬
ages the preservation of the architectural heritage in Scotland) and the Ulster
Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; the
Council for British Archaeology; the Historic Churches Preservation Trust;
the Council for National Parks; the Prince of Wales’s Committee (which
promotes environmental improvements in Wales); the Inland Waterways
Association; Friends of the Earth; the Conservation Society; the Noise
Abatement Society; and the National Society for Clean Air.
Among a large number of voluntary bodies concerned with nature conserva¬
tion are the Society for the Promotion of Nature Conservation, the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Wildlife Trust.
The Council for Environmental Conservation, comprising many of the main
voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is concerned with broader
questions of amenity than those covered by individual societies.
9 Housing
Housing
Characteristics
There has been a significant general improvement in housing conditions
during the last 30 years. In national terms the supply of housing and the
demand are in better balance, and needs and problems have become increas-
ingly specific and local. The emphasis of public sector housing policy is being
shifted from new building to modernisation, improvement and making better
use of the existing stock. In the private sector encouragement of home
ownership and of the rented sector are central policy aims. The Housing Act
1980 reflects this in providing a tenants’ charter for public sector tenants, with
the right for many to buy their homes, a new system of shorthold tenancies, a
more effective improvement and repair grant system and a more flexible
subsidy system.
Since 1978-79, when a system of local housing strategies and investment
programmes was introduced, local authorities have been able, in consultation
with other bodies concerned, to plan their housing investment in the light of a
comprehensive assessment of local housing needs. From 1980-81 capital
allocations under this system are to be given in a single block within which local
authorities will be free to decide their own priorities for housing investment.
Public expenditure provision for housing stood at nearly £5,400 million in
1979-80, but the figure is likely to decline in subsequent years in line with
government expenditure plans.
There are over 21 million dwellings, houses being much more common than
flats (the ratio is roughly four to one). Nationally the number of dwellings is
slightly larger than the number of households, but there continue to be
shortages in certain areas and, because of changing social habits, the houses
available are not always of the type in demand.
More than two families in every five live in a post-1945 home, but there
remain a large number of old dwellings, some of which have been kept in good
repair and modernised, but many others of which (particularly in the centres of
cities) are unsatisfactory by modern standards.
Throughout this century pressure on housing accommodation has been
increased more by the rapid rise in the number of separate households than by
the increase in the population. While the number of people has increased by
about two-fifths, the number of households has more than doubled. Families
are smaller, there has been a substantial reduction in the sharing of homes by
different generations of the same family and there has been an increase in the
number of one-person households. The National Dwelling and Housing Survey
(results only for England so far; see Bibliography) showed a fall, from 800,000
to 500,000, in the number of households sharing a dwelling between 1971 and
i977-78» a halving, from 2-8 million to 1-4 million, in the number of house¬
holds without exclusive use of at least one of the basic amenities, such as a bath,
and a fall of two-thirds, from 219,000 to 73,000, in the number of over¬
crowded households.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, nearly a third are
rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are rented
190 BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from private landlords. There are variations, however, in the distribution of
tenure between different parts of the country; in Scotland more than half the
dwellings are rented from public authorities. Private rented accommodation is
generally more common in the central parts of large towns, while owner-
occupation is more frequent in outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction is undertaken, on a roughly equal scale, by both
public and private sectors, and in addition about 10 per cent of new building is
carried out by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authorities
provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly for
sale to owner-occupiers. There is very little building of private dwellings to
rent (see p 192), although there are provisions in the Housing Act 1980
designed to encourage new building for private letting by such bodies as
building societies, pension funds and insurance companies.
Administration Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme in Great Britain is borne by the Secretary of State for the
Environment in England and by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Wales. (For Northern Ireland see p 194.)
Most of the public housing is provided by 459 local housing authorities,
which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of housing in their areas is
adequate. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London) the
district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the London
borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London; and in
Scotland, the district and islands councils. Other public housing authorities
are the new town authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association
which supplements building by local authorities in Scotland, and the Develop¬
ment Board for Rural Wales. Subsidies are made available to the authorities
to assist them with housing costs, and guidance is given on design and
layout.
The construction or structural alteration of housing in both the public and
private sectors is subject to the Building Regulations in England (except inner
London) and Wales. The regulations, which are made by the Secretary of State
for the Environment, have the force of law. They are enforced by the local
authorities and are made primarily for the health and safety of people in and
around the buildings, although they also include requirements for the conser¬
vation of energy. Different systems with the same aims are operated in inner
London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities are involved in many other aspects of housing policy, such
as the payment of house renovation grants and the implementation of housing
renewal programmes. Many have established housing advisory centres to
provide information on most aspects of housing.
Research and Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the social,
Development economic and design aspects of housing, is undertaken within the Department
of the Environment. It is carried out by the Building Research Establishment
of the Department’s research directorate as well as by the directorates of
economics, statistics and housing development. The Research and Develop¬
ment Group of the Scottish Development Department also undertakes
research. Sponsored work is carried out by academic institutes, consultancies,
market research firms and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, and
local authorities may also have housing research programmes. Advice on ways
of increasing quality, productivity and efficiency in house-building is provided
by the National Building Agency.

I9I
The number of people owning their own homes has more than doubled in the
last 20 years, and the n million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain account
for over half of the total housing stock.
Loans to enable people to buy their own homes are available from various
sources, including building societies, insurance companies, industrial and
provident societies, local authorities and banks.
Building societies (see also p 364) are by far the largest sources of such funds,
their share of the market being about 80 per cent. They do not build houses
themselves but lend money upon security by way of a mortgage on the home
bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up to 80 per cent of their
valuation of a property but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent with the
help of an appropriate insurance guarantee. Loans are normally repayable over
periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain circumstances) by equal
monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The average price in Britain
of all houses bought with a building society mortgage at the end of 1979 was
about £24,100. In 1979 the societies advanced nearly £8,860 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest pay¬
ments arising on up to £25,000 of their mortgages (on one house only) and in
1979-80 this totalled about £1,450 million. An alternative form of assistance is
the option mortgage scheme, designed to help those with smaller incomes. It
allows the borrower to receive, instead of tax relief, a subsidy which has the
effect of reducing the rate of interest on the loan. Assistance under this scheme
in Great Britain totalled £190 million in 1979-80. There is an associated
guarantee scheme under which mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the
valuation of a house (not exceeding £14,000) may be made to option borrow¬
ers. Other ways of helping people with lower incomes to become owner-
occupiers include schemes operated by a number of local authorities which
allow those buying homes for the first time, subject to certain conditions, to
defer part of the mortgage payments that would normally be due in the early
years until later in the mortgage term; and shared ownership schemes, under
which the occupant purchases a part share of his or her home, paying rent on
the remaining share.
From 1 December 1980 first-time home buyers who have saved for two years
under the new homeloan scheme (set up under the Home Purchase Assistance
and Housing Corporation Guarantee Act 1978) and are buying a home in the
lower-price range, may qualify for a loan of £600, interest free for up to five
years, and a tax-free cash bonus of up to £110.
For building in the private sector the National House Building Council sets
standards and enforces them by inspection and certification. Almost all new
private houses are covered by the Council’s insurance scheme which provides
ten-year protection against major structural defects. Two-year protection is
also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not grant mortgages
on a new house unless it is covered by a Council certificate.
Public housing authorities own nearly seven million houses and flats. The
number of homes owned by each authority varies widely, several of the larger
authorities having a stock of well over 100,000.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction and of
modernisation of their existing stock by raising loans on the open market or by
borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board. Current expenditure, includ¬
ing maintenance and management costs and loan interest and repayments, is

met from rents, supplemented by subsidies from the Government and, where
required to balance housing revenue accounts, from the rates. Local
authorities are required to charge their tenants reasonable rents (which keep a
balance between the interests of tenants and ratepayers). Subsidies for public
housing in Great Britain during 1979-80 are expected to total some £2,500
million (including rent rebates payable to poorer tenants to assist in meeting
rents of accommodation suited to their needs). Supplementary subsidies assist
local authorities with slum clearance.
Most building is undertaken by private firms under contract although a
number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses. Some authorities
work in consortia to make the best use of experience and technical information,
and to initiate research and development projects.
Sheltered accommodation (with an alarm system and resident warden) is
provided for elderly people who need this degree of support. Increasing
importance is also being placed on the housing needs of physically handi¬
capped people, and a small but growing proportion of the new housing stock is
suitable for them. Also receiving attention are the needs of other ‘disadvan¬
taged’ groups such as one-parent families, those who have suffered from
mental illness, and victims of violence within the family.
Public housing is built to high standards, which include mandatory space
and heating requirements. In England and Wales, for example, some 98-3 per
cent of the new houses built for local authorities in 1978 had central heating and
the average floor area of houses to accommodate five people was 89 square
metres (958 square feet).
Local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that accommodation (not
necessarily an authority house) is available for homeless people who have
dependent children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
The Housing Act 1980 establishes a charter for public-sector tenants, giving
them statutory rights such as security of tenure, provision for succession by a
resident relative to the tenancy on death, rights of subletting and taking in
lodgers, and reimbursement for improvements made by the tenant. With
certain exceptions, public sector tenants of at least three years’ standing can
buy the freehold of their house, or a long lease of their flat, at a discount on the
market price of from 33 per cent to 50 per cent, depending on the length of their
occupation. The discount must be repaid in part or in full if the property is
resold within five years. Tenants also have the right to be given a mortgage by
the local authority to effect the purchase. Similar provisions for Scotland are
contained in the Tenants’ Rights etc (Scotland) Act 1980.
During the last quarter of a century there has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from private landlords (including tied
accommodation)—from over 50 per cent of the housing stock to about 12 per
cent (2-6 million). Major factors have been the increased demand for owner-
occupation, the greater availability of public rented housing, and the operation
of rent restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of the
older housing, most landlords being individuals with limited holdings; some
rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including property
companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants have
a wide degree of security of tenure, and may not be evicted without a court
order. Harassment of residential occupiers is a criminal offence. To increase
the availability of privately rented property the Government has introduced in
the Housing Act 1980 and in the Tenants’ Rights etc (Scotland) Act 1980 a

new system of ‘shorthold’ lettings, under which tenants have security of tenure
at a fair rent for an agreed period of between one and five years, but not for life;
existing regulated lettings are not affected by the new legislation. Tenants with
incomes up to average levels are eligible for assistance with their rent under a
national scheme of rent allowances which is operated by local authorities and
financed mainly by government subsidies.
There are two forms of rent restriction: regulation and the fixing of a
reasonable rent by a rent tribunal. In a regulated tenancy a ‘fair rent’ is fixed by
independent rent officers, at the request of the landlord, the tenant, or both; if
the rent officer’s decision is objected to by the landlord or the tenant, it is
referred to a rent assessment committee. Once fixed, the rent is registered and
not normally reviewed for at least two years. The other form of rent restriction
applies to tenants with resident landlords and tenants of a few other types of
furnished accommodation who may refer their tenancy agreements to a rent
tribunal for determination of a reasonable rent. Tribunals may grant tenants
security of tenure for up to six months with a possibility of further periods.
Housing associations extend the choice of housing (which for most people is
between owner-occupying or renting from a public authority or a private
landlord) by providing an increasing amount of accommodation available for
rent through new building or the rehabilitation of older property. The associa¬
tions normally cater for people who would otherwise look to a local authority
for a home. In addition to normal family housing, they provide particularly for
the special needs of elderly, disabled and single people.
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of these
non-profit-making associations which between them own nearly 340,000 dwel¬
lings. Rented housing schemes carried out by housing associations qualify for a
government grant but only if the association is registered with the Housing
Corporation, a statutory body set up by the Government. Some 2,800 associa¬
tions are registered with the Corporation. Rented dwellings owned by housing
associations come within the fair rent and rent allowance arrangements and
many housing association tenants have rights under the tenants’ charter in the
Housing Act 1980 (see p 192).
Alternative forms of tenure on local authority estates and within the housing
association sector are being encouraged in order to give occupiers a greater
stake in the ownership or management of their homes. The Housing Corpora¬
tion is engaged in a pilot programme including co-ownership and community
leasehold schemes.
Modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing, with the help of grants
from public funds, has increasingly been encouraged as an alternative to
clearing and rebuilding and as a way of preserving established communities
and of making more economic use of resources.
Renovation grants paid to householders to improve over 1 -4 million homes
were paid in Great Britain between 1967 and 1979. A further 1 -2 million public
sector homes were also improved in this period.
There are four types of renovation grant: improvement grants, for carrying
out improvements to a high standard or for conversion into flats; intermediate
grants, for the provision of standard amenities and associated repairs; repair
grants; and special grants (not available in Scotland) for providing standard
amenities, repairs and means of escape from fire in houses which are in
multiple occupation.

local authorities in England and Wales to tackle the improvement of whole
areas of older housing systematically. General improvement areas (of which
there are about 1,300) consist of fundamentally sound houses and a stable
population. Housing action areas (about 440) are characterised by particularly
poor housing and bad physical conditions combined with social stress. Local
authorities have special powers to bring about an improvement in living
conditions for the benefit of residents within a five-year period. In both types
of area government financial aid for environmental improvement is available to
local authorities. Grants to householders may range up to 75 per cent, and in
certain cases (such as hardship) up to 90 per cent.
An ‘improvement-for-sale’ scheme has also been introduced; the Govern¬
ment makes contributions towards any loss a local authority may make in
buying, improving and selling rundown or neglected housing.
In Scotland, the term ‘general improvement area’ is not used; ‘housing
action area’ powers are available for areas in which at least half the houses fail to
meet prescribed physical standards and there is no time limit on the period
within which improvement must be carried out. Outside housing action areas
in Scotland local authorities have power to require the improvement of houses
below the statutory tolerable standard, or lacking a bathroom, by improvement
orders and grants payable at 75 per cent of eligible costs.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment have been major
features of housing policy. Since the mid-1950s about 32 million people have
been rehoused in England and Wales as a result of slum clearance programmes.
Clearance of large areas of ‘irredeemable’ slums is now almost at an end and
greater emphasis is placed on renewal and modernisation wherever possible.
Local authorities receive special financial assistance from the Government.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners of
land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their compen¬
sation up to market value.
Redevelopment of the slums has presented many problems. Most of the
areas were seriously overcrowded; but while they usually lacked social facilities
they had the advantage of already being provided with the basic utilities, jobs
were usually available in the vicinity and town centre facilities were not far
away. The aim in carrying out slum clearance was thus to house as many people
as possible on the cleared sites. This was most easily achieved if fairly large
areas were cleared and high-rise flats built. The results in many areas are now
seen as less than satisfactory in spite of the high standard of many of the homes
themselves. The main criticisms of multi-storey flats are that they are inhuman
in scale and unsuitable for families with young children because of the lack of
convenient play space. The need to build to a reasonably high density in inner
city areas still exists, but is now being met by carefully grouped low-rise blocks,
including individual houses wherever possible.
The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is responsible for
housing policy in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Housing Execu¬
tive, with a stock of some 190,000 dwellings, is responsible for the provision
and management of public authority housing and for dealing with unfit
dwellings whether publicly or privately owned.
HOUSING
I95
Northern Ireland has a major problem of unfit and derelict housing, especi¬
ally in Belfast, and the situation has been made worse by civil disturbance.
Housing policy is therefore directed towards maintaining and improving the
existing dwelling stock and mounting a major attack on housing problems in
Belfast. The concept of housing action areas has been developed to facilitate
concerted action in designated areas and a five-year programme for the
rehabilitation of Belfast began in 1977. Action has also been taken to stimulate
the voluntary housing movement and with the encouragement of the Depart¬
ment in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Federation of Housing Associ¬
ations, registered housing associations are undertaking a large programme of
schemes for groups such as the elderly and disabled and are also playing a
significant part in the rehabilitation of older dwellings, especially in Belfast.
In the private rented sector the Rent (Northern Ireland) Order 1978
replaced earlier legislation with a single statute designed to safeguard tenants’
rights while providing landlords with sufficient rental income to maintain their
property in good condition. Under the Order landlords are empowered to
increase the rents of certain properties meeting a specified standard of physical
condition to a level comparable with those charged by the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive. Policy for the private sector is under review.
Another trend in housing policy is the attempt to widen housing options
available to families, particularly those who wish to own their own homes. The
Option Mortgage Scheme is in operation and the Home Loan Scheme for
first-time buyers has been extended to Northern Ireland. The concept of
shared ownership (see p 191) is being developed in the public sector by the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive and in the private sector by the Northern
Ireland Co-Ownership Housing Association. In line with government policy,
the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has offered its dwellings (with the
exception of flats, maisonettes and sheltered dwellings) for sale to sitting
tenants.
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship
and observance) without interference from the community or the State.
Churches and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and
propagate their beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denomi¬
national bar to the holding of public office.
Clergy of the established churches of England and Scotland work in services
administered by the State, such as the armed forces, national hospitals and
prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other denominations are
also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by any religious denomination
may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are normally made about religious beliefs in
censuses or other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in
counting its members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore
approximate.
The established Church of England’s relationship with the State is one of
mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain
duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime
Minister; all clergy take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can
regulate its own worship. The two archbishops (of Canterbury and York),
the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops
(according to their seniority as diocesan bishops) sit in the House of Lords.
Clergy of the Church (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the
Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are not allowed to sit in
the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and
York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into parishes, of which there are
some 13,860. The Archbishop of Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England’, and
the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and
resident in the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 58 per cent are
baptised into the Church and some 19 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual
authority and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and
lay members are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be
referred for the approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod.
Lay members are associated with church government in the parishes through
the ancient office of churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
such matters as education, mission, inter-church relations, social questions,
recruitment and training for the ministry, church work at home and overseas
and the care of church buildings, particularly those of historic and architec¬
tural interest. The Synod is also concerned with church schools; church

colleges of education; theological colleges; and establishments for training
women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services, includ¬
ing capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for
training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial con¬
tribution to church expenses. The Church’s endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for
the payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 25 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of
England (established), the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in Scot¬
land, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference meets for unofficial consultation
among all Anglican bishops (the last meeting was in 1978): presided over by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys great
prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other commun¬
ions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied. The
Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well as
bishops which meets every two or three years—is designed to provide consul¬
tations within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of
common action. The Council last met in 1979.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government. Its status as
the national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707 and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
All ministers have equal status, each of some 1,870 churches being governed
locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and the elected elders of
the Church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the Presbytery, then the
Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, consisting of elected
ministers and elders, which meets annually under the presidency of an elected
moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The adult communicant
membership of the Church of Scotland is estimated at over 970,000.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England and Wales (which dissent from certain practices of the
established church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions
regarding organisation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of
Britain (apart from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other
churches and religious associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with nearly
517,000 adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the
evangelical revival by John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not join the
union include the Independent Methodists (5,000 members) and the Wesleyan
Reform Union (with some 4,000 members).

The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
I8i3), with a total membership of about 178,000; in addition there are
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist
churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some 157,000 members, was formed in
1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with some 132,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers about
87,000; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the
United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of America
as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community in Britain
since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the Moravian
Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free Church of
England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a
direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational Federation,
formed from Congregational churches which did not enter the United
Reformed Church.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with about 19,000 members in
Britain and over 440 places for worship, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace
and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 82 other
countries and has a strength of about 2*5 million. Within Britain it has some
100,000 active members operating from more than 1,000 centres of worship.
Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern, the Salvation
Army has 200 centres to help people in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 262
branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scott¬
ish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored
in 1878. There are now six Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain,
each under an archbishop, 26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes.
In Northern Ireland, there are nine dioceses, some of which have territory
partly in the Irish Republic. It is estimated that there are some 5 million
adherents (including children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of
Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Catholic children are staffed by members of

Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but the
community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some 400,000 people,
including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal) and Ashkenazi
(from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the largest groups
of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools of thought—the
Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews belong; and the
Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by the Liberal
Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ash¬
kenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi group.
Jewish congregations in Britain number about 300. Jewish denominational
schools are attended by about one in four Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. For the many Muslims in
Britain there are mosques or Islamic centres in London, Birmingham, Man¬
chester, Cardiff, Glasgow and in many other large cities. The community’s
headquarters are at the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.
The Buddhist Society, with headquarters in London and centres in most
large towns and many universities, publishes and makes known the principles
of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice. It adheres to no one
school of Buddhism. There are other centres for Buddhism, and also centres of
eastern philosophy and religion among immigrant communities.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from ail
the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action and
seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian Aid
(which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission; Ecumeni¬
cal Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
The permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two communions.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also partici¬
pate in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of
Churches is an associated national council) which links together some 300
churches in over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common
problems. The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding
among members of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.

11 The National Economy
Britain exports a larger part of its production of goods and services than any
other industrial nation of comparable size—about one-third of gross domestic
product, a higher proportion than in the Federal Republic of Germany or
France and considerably higher than in the United States or Japan. Manufac¬
turing industry accounts for 28 per cent of total domestic output and services1
for 62 per cent.
Britain ranks fifth in world trade (after the United States, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan and France), and accounts for 5-5 per cent of
total world trade. It takes around 7 per cent of the world’s exports of primary
products (excluding food) and has provided about 9 per cent of the main
manufacturing countries’ exports of manufactured goods in each of the last
seven years. It is one of the world’s largest importers of agricultural products,
raw materials and semi-manufactures, and is among the largest exporters of
aerospace products, motor vehicles, electrical equipment, finished textiles,
and most types of machinery. It is also a growing oil exporter.
The economy is largely based on private enterprise, but has some major
State-owned (nationalised) industries and some enterprises with both private
and state participation (see p 222).
With the discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, Britain
achieved virtual self-sufficiency in oil and gas in 1980 with substantial benefits
to the balance of payments through the reduction of oil imports. Other
economic effects of the offshore oil industry include the revenues accruing
through taxation, the new jobs created, and the stimulus provided for the
development and sales of highly specialised equipment and services.
A high level of agricultural productivity enables Britain to provide just over
half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 2-6 per cent of the
employed labour force is engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than in
any other major industrial country.
Britain earns overseas currency by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods
and by invisible transactions—in overseas investment, travel, civil aviation,
shipping, and financial and other services. It accounts for almost 9 per cent of
world invisible receipts (excluding government transactions) and is second
only to the United States in its invisible surplus.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Earlier History As a result of the Industrial Revolution during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character

and After

of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It
occupied the leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier,
banker and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increas¬
ing population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear
though declining lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914,
industrial competition from Europe and North America grew, but its effects on
Britain’s export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by
a number of factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on
Britain’s large overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing
competition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European
countries and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was
cheaper. The difficulties were increased by the world economic depression
which began in 1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce
imports. The result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy un¬
employment. After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The
decade saw a strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft
industries, while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large
growth in the building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (1939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained, in
a modified form, a feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war made
heavy inroads on British domestic capital through shipping losses, bomb
damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Large quan¬
tities of overseas investments were sold, new external debts were accumulated,
and exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. The period after 1945 was one of
rising production and, until 1970, a low level of unemployment (generally
2-5 per cent or lower); but economic growth, which averaged 2 to 3 per cent
up to 1971, was slower than in most other western European countries.
There were also certain persistent economic problems, particularly the
periodic difficulties with the balance of payments. In spite of the contri¬
bution from invisibles, there were substantial deficits on current account
in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems in a
number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices.
Following the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2-80 to $2-40=£i , exports
recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record current
account surplus in 1971.
In 1973, the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about 7 per cent.
However, with, among other things, general inflation and the abrupt increase
in the prices of commodities in 1972 and 1973, particularly of oil in late 1973,
the world economy entered a phase of recession. At the same time, the very
large balance of payments surpluses of the oil-producing countries following
the rise in oil prices gave rise to a corresponding deficit for the oil-importing
countries collectively, which could not quickly be eliminated. Although some
202
Economic
Policy
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
recovery from this recession was evident from about 1976, it proved to be
weak, especially in Britain.
The rate of price inflation accelerated in almost all countries in 1979, with
crude oil prices almost doubling over the year. Output in the industrial
countries was, however, relatively buoyant although unemployment began to
rise again. World trade in manufactures grew by around 5 per cent, slightly
faster than in 1978 but well below the pre-1973 trend of 10 per cent annually.
Industrial countries as a whole moved into balance of payments deficit.
The British economy grew slowly in 1979. Gross domestic product (output
measure) rose by 1-7 per cent in real terms compared with an annual average
rate of growth of 1 per cent over the period 1973-78 and 3 per cent from 1963 to
1973. The North Sea oil and gas sector was responsible for about half of the
growth in gross domestic product in 1979, production rising by more than 40
per cent, following a four-fold increase over the period 1976-78. In 1979 the
value of oil and gas sales from the UK Continental Shelf (at contract prices)
plus identifiable balance of payments current account items (net) is estimated
to have amounted to £4,300 million.
Real disposable incomes increased substantially in Britain in 1979 as gross
earnings rose faster than prices and income tax was reduced. Real personal
disposable income was 6 per cent higher in 1979 than in 1978. Consumers’
spending rose in real terms by 4 per cent over the same period.
Total fixed investment fell by 1-4 per cent in 1979 in real terms, with
reduced investment in the North Sea oil and gas industries and in dwellings.
Investment by the distributive and service industries (after adjusting for
leasing) rose by 4-4 per cent in 1979, the fourth successive year of growth.
Manufacturing investment, including leased assets, rose by 2-7 per cent. The
growth in leasing has been a recent development.
The volume of exports of goods increased by about 4 per cent in 1979,
compared with some 3 per cent in 1978. Within the 1979 total, exports of fuels
increased by 33 per cent, but exports of manufactures were virtually
unchanged. The volume of imports grew by 10 per cent in the year but, within
this, imports of manufactures rose by 15 per cent, particularly consumer
products and especially passenger motor cars, reflecting the fact that much of
the rise in consumer demand was met by imports.
The slow fall in unemployment over the previous two years ended towards
the close of 1979 and during the first half of 1980 the level of unemployment
increased.
Retail prices rose by an average of 16 per cent a year between 1973 and 1978.
The rate of increase, which dipped temporarily from 1977, began to accelerate
in 1979 as earlier favourable movements in commodity prices ended and as
accelerating wage costs were reflected in prices. By September 1980 the retail
prices index was 15-9 per cent higher than a year earlier. The tax and price
index, which takes account of changes in both prices and direct taxation, was
17-3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The Government elected in May 1979 has identified the long-term weaknesses
of the British economy as high inflation, slow growth and poor industrial
performance. As the beginning of a medium-term policy to reverse the decline,
the Budget strategy announced in June 1979 was to curb inflation by firm fiscal
and monetary policies and to improve the supply side of the economy by
removing obstacles and allowing market forces to work. To strengthen incen¬
tives the burden of taxation was partly shifted from direct to indirect taxation.
In November 1979 the Government announced a series of measures which
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
203
Public
Enterprise
underlined its determination to secure monetary control. These included
raising the Bank of England minimum lending rate to 17 per cent (reduced to
16 per cent in July 1980).
A four-year financial strategy covering expenditure, taxation and the money
supply was announced in the March 1980 Budget. The Government’s first
priority remains to reduce the rate of inflation by means of a steady reduction in
the rate of monetary growth, supported by cuts in public spending and
borrowing and a continuing strengthening of the supply side of the economy by
tax and other incentives and improved efficiency. The strategy shows growth
of sterling M3 (money in circulation and UK residents’ sterling bank deposits)
falling from 7-11 per cent in 1980-81 to about 6 per cent in 1983-84. In order
to achieve this without intolerably high interest rates, public sector borrowing
is to be reduced from 4-75 per cent of GDP in 1979-80 to 1-5 per cent in
1983—84. The volume of public spending is to be progressively reduced to a
level in 1983-84 about 4 per cent lower than in 1979-80. Planned spending in
1980-81 will be reduced by over 0*5 per cent in real terms. Spending on
defence, law and order, health and social security will rise over the period; the
main reductions in expenditure will be in the industry, energy and employ¬
ment programmes, housing and education. The reduction in the net contribu¬
tion to the European Community budget, negotiated in mid-1980, will bring
about a further saving.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The Government’s policies are carried out by the main departments with
economic responsibilities on a national scale: the Treasury, the Departments
of Trade, Industry, Employment, Energy, the Environment, and Transport
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Other specialist bodies
advise on specific aspects of economic policy and include the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister, the Office of Fair Trading, a government agency concerned
with the conduct of trade and industry (see p 231) and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (see p 231).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
on the economic problems it faces, the Government makes known its purposes,
and keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy, by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests
with the Cabinet. For regional economic planning see Chapter 8.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct State intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) has often been effected
through special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a
particular activity. Though not part of a government department, the corpora¬
tions are under varying degrees of public control. The Government is reducing
the extent of State-ownership of industry by selling off some assets, increasing
competition and providing opportunities for employees to participate where
appropriate. Shares are to be sold in British Aerospace and (eventually) British
Airways, changing their status to limited liability companies.
The major nationalised industries are the National Coal Board, British Gas,
the electricity industry and the British National Oil Corporation; the British
Steel Corporation, British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders; the Post
204
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Office; British Rail, the National Freight Corporation, the National Bus
Company and British Airways. These industries and services, which employ
about 8 per cent of all employees, are described in their relevant sections. The
public sector employs about 30 per cent of the working population.
Output
NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
In 1979 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to nearly £164,000 million. After allowing for
price changes, the increase over the ten years since 1969 was 21 per cent.
Just under 30 per cent of total output can be attributed to manufacturing
industry, rather less than a decade ago. Expanding industry groups in recent
years have been mining and quarrying (reflecting the contribution of North
Sea oil and gas), and services including insurance, banking and finance and
health and education.

Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding. The
discrepancy for 1969 is particularly large owing to the method used to rebase at 1975 prices.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £39,240 million in 1969 to £166,470 million in 1979. Real personal
disposable income was 6 per cent higher in 1979 than in 1978.
Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 69 per cent of total pre-tax income in
1979 compared with 74 per cent in 1969. The difference is accounted for by a
sharp rise in the personal savings ratio.
Income from employment in 1979 totalled £113,930 million and accounted for
about 68 per cent of total personal income. The three other main sources of
personal income were self-employment (9 per cent), income from rent,
dividends and interest (10 per cent), and grants from general government (13
per cent).
The combined effect of all taxation and transfer payments and benefits in
kind is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies
by the Central Statistical Office, the effect is broadly to raise the share of the
poorest fifth of households from about 1 per cent of total original income to
about 9 per cent of all final income. This group contains 12 per cent of the
population and consists mainly of retired people, dependent on State pensions.
The share of the richest fifth falls from about 44 per cent to about 36 per cent.
A rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in Britain
as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
Table 9 shows the amounts and proportions of consumers’ expenditure at
current prices in 1969 and 1979. Over this period the proportions spent on
food, tobacco, and clothing and footwear fell while the proportions spent on
alcoholic drink, housing and cars and motorcycles rose. At constant (1975)
prices consumers’ expenditure increased by 4 per cent between 1978 and 1979.

Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government
and local authorities rose by about 29 per cent at 1975 market prices over the
period 1969 to 1979 when it amounted to almost 23 per cent of the gross
domestic product (at current prices). The main cause of this increase was
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
207
Investment

Payments
the growth over the period of the social services, especially education and
the National Health Service. In the same period defence accounted for a
declining share of general government expenditure on goods and services (22
per cent in 1978 and 1979 compared with 32 per cent in 1968 and 48 per
cent in 1953).
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp 145 and 191). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 60 per cent of their current expenditure.
Gross domestic fixed capital formation (total fixed investment) represents
about 20 per cent of the gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value of
fixed assets in Britain, valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to have
increased by 37 per cent between 1969 and 1979 when their current replace¬
ment value, net of depreciation, was some £605,400 million, of which about
two-thirds was accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and machin¬
ery, and vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1979 (£20,506
million compared with a peak of £21,195 million in 1973 at constant 1975
prices) private sector investment accounted for 67 per cent (58 per cent in
I973)> general government for 16 per cent (27 per cent) and public corpora¬
tions for 17 per cent (15 per cent). The approximate shares of industry
groups in total fixed investment in 1979 were (1973 figures in brackets):
manufacturing, 20 per cent (16 per cent), gas, electricity and water, 5 per
cent (5 per cent), petroleum and natural gas 6 per cent (1 per cent), transport
and communications, 9 per cent (13 per cent), distributive trades, 7 per cent
(6 per cent), dwellings, 17 per cent (19 per cent), social and other public
services, 10 per cent (16 per cent), and other industries, 26 per cent (22 per
cent). There is a marked cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by
manufacturing industry; it was at a peak in 1970 and 1974, fell in 1975 and
1976 but increased in 1977, 1978 and 1979. Among the trends in recent years
has been the increase in investment in North Sea oil and gas equipment
which reached a peak in 1976.
THE EXTERNAL POSITION
A broad picture of Britain’s trade in the 1970s shows a strong trade balance in
the early part of the period which deteriorated considerably in 1973 and 1974
after sharp increases in oil and other commodity prices. Some of the pressure
was offset by falls in the sterling exchange rate following floating of the pound
in 1972 (see p 208) and export volume increased by 30 per cent between 1973
and 1979, with a surplus on the current account in 1978. However, a large
deterioration in visible trade occurred in 1979. The contribution from oil
continued to increase but there was a substantial fall in the surplus on manufac¬
tured goods. (A major factor in this decline was the worsening international
competitiveness of British goods caused by the failure of the sterling exchange
rate to adjust in line with relative inflation rates.) A fall in the invisibles surplus
was caused mainly by sharp increases in the profits of overseas oil companies in
Britain, higher contributions to the European Community budget and higher
aid payments. There was a surplus on the capital account in 1979, a net
identified inflow of £1,170 million representing a balance between the
2o8
Exchange
Rates and

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
substantial capital outflows following abolition of exchange controls during the
year and inflows resulting from a marked change in the attractiveness of
sterling. For details of overseas trade and payments see Chapter 19.
In I97I* a general international realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a
meeting held in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, in which all the main
currencies were in effect revalued against the dollar. (The rates of exchange
fixed in that agreement are called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this
realignment, the sterling rate for the dollar moved up by just over 85 per cent,
the new middle rate being $2-60571 compared with the old par value of $2-40.
In June 1972 sterling was allowed to float. Subsequent movements were
broadly downwards to a low level in 1976, after which, helped by the positive
economic implications of Britain’s energy prospects, the pressure on the pound
in the foreign exchange markets was generally upwards. Since 1979 sterling has
been among the stronger currencies, reflecting the market’s favourable assess¬
ment of Britain’s position as an oil producer at a time of rising oil prices and
its relatively high interest rates. At the beginning of September 1980 the
effective rate was 76-5 (December 1971 = 100) and the market rate
= $2-42.
Britain incurred large overseas debts to finance balance of payments deficits
in the years 1973-76. In consequence total official foreign borrowing outstand¬
ing rose to $25,200 million by the end of 1977 (compared with some $5,000
million at the end of 1972, largely accounted for by long-term post-war debts).
By the end of 1977, however, the improvement in the external position enabled
policy to be directed towards reducing the total debt outstanding and the
concentration of debt due to be repaid in 1979-84. This has been done by a
combination of early repayments of debt and taking out new borrowing to
refinance existing debt due to mature during the period. During 1979 the
Government and the public sector made net debt repayments of $2,100
million. Further early repayments to the IMF in early 1979 effectively extin¬
guished Britain’s debt to the IMF, apart from the oil facility of some $1,200
million which was drawn in 1976 and is being repaid in 16 equal instalments
over the period 1979-83.
The reserves are officially revalued at the end of March each year to bring
their published value more closely in line with their market worth by valuing
non-dollar reserves on a market-related basis. Revaluation increased the value
of the reserves to $27,000 million at the end of March 1980. At the end of
September 1980 the reserves stood at $27,637 million.
The European Community established a European Monetary System in
March 1979 aimed at the creation of a zone of monetary stability in Europe. It
consists of an exchange rate mechanism, a monetary unit known as the
European Currency Unit (ECU—based on a basket of national currencies
including sterling, its value being recalculated daily) and enlarged Com¬
munity short- and medium-term credit facilities. The member states of the
European Community are also committed to the establishment of a European
Monetary Fund as part of this system. Britain has participated in the system
from the outset although not in the exchange rate arrangements and has
deposited 20 per cent of its gold and dollar reserve with the European
Monetary Co-operation Fund in exchange for European Currency Units.
The Government intends that Britain should join the exchange rate mechan¬
ism when conditions permit. Its first and overriding priority is to gain control
of domestic monetary conditions and to reduce the rate of inflation to nearer
the Community average.

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY ZOQ
A second set of amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) entered into force on i April 1978. (The first amend¬
ments were made in 1969 when the Special Drawing Right—SDR—was
established.) They bring the articles up to date and provide for necessary
flexibility. The amendments were drawn up under the guidance of the Interim
Committee, which succeeded the Committee of Twenty in 1974.
Members undertake a general obligation to collaborate with the IMF and
with other members in order to ensure orderly exchange arrangements and to
promote a stable system of exchange rates. Under the new provisions the Fund
will be able to determine that, in accordance with specified criteria, interna¬
tional economic conditions permit the introduction of a system based on stable
but adjustable par values. Each member will then be able, though not bound,
to establish a par value. The amendments provided for a gradual reduction in
the role of gold in the international monetary system. The function of gold as
the unit of value of the SDR has been eliminated, the official price has been
abolished and members are free to deal in gold in the market and among
themselves without reference to any official price, and obligatory payments in
gold by members to the Fund and by the Fund to members have been
abrogated. The IMF’s gold holdings have been reduced; one-sixth has been
returned to members, and a further sixth has been auctioned, the major
proportion of the proceeds from the auctions being disbursed through a trust
fund, set up to provide medium-term balance of payments support to the
poorest developing countries. Changes have been made in the role of the SDR
in order to enhance its status as an international reserve asset. The amendment
also provides for changes in the organisation of the Fund and in its financial
operations (see also below).
The IMF set up borrowing arrangements (known as the oil facility) in 1974
and on a larger and more liberal scale in 1975, through which countries were
able to draw on funds lent mainly by the oil-producers. The facility was fully
drawn and creditors will be repaid by 1983.
An extended facility for medium-term assistance to members with special
balance of payments problems caused by structural economic changes was also
introduced in 1974. A supplementary financing facility entered into force in
1979, to provide financial assistance to members whose payments imbalances
were large in relation to their economies and to their quotas in the Fund.
The entry into force of the Second Amendment of the IMF’s articles in 1978
enabled the implementation of increases under the Sixth General Review of
Quotas. As a result, total Fund quotas were raised from SDR 29,000 million to
SDR 39,000 million.
The production industries (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construc¬
tion, and gas, electricity and water), together with the distributive trades and
transport and communications, account for some 61 per cent of Britain’s gross
domestic product (see Table 7 on p 204) and for about 54 per cent of total
employment. Financial and business services, professional and scientific ser¬
vices (excluding public health and education services) and the various service
trades (such as catering, entertainment, and personal and household services)
contribute a further 23 per cent of gross domestic product.
This chapter describes some of the general features of industrial activity,
such as the forms of enterprise and trends in production, productivity and
investment, and the geographical distribution of industry. It also describes
government measures to stimulate or, where necessary, regulate industrial
activity. The chapters following cover the main areas of industrial and com¬
mercial activity.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The forms of industrial organisation and the pattern of ownership and control
are varied. Personal, corporate (including co-operative) and public sector
enterprise all assume a number of different forms, and all are important in the
economy.
Excluding farmers, there were about i-8 million personal enterprises (pro¬
fessional persons and other sole traders and partnerships) in Britain in 1979,
generating domestic income of about £15,270 million. The domestic income of
public sector enterprise (see pp 203 and 222) amounted to some £5,580
million, excluding income from rent and non-trading income. Corporate
enterprise (see p 233) comprises industrial, commercial and financial com¬
panies and certain other financial institutions. Within this sector the domestic
income of industrial and commercial enterprises amounted to £28,660 million
in 1979, excluding income from rent and non-trading income. Companies may
be either public or private (see p 233). Most of Britain’s large firms are public
companies, while the great majority of private companies are small. There
were 16,283 public companies at the end of 1979 and 720,323 private com¬
panies.
Most manufacturing (with the exceptions of steel, aerospace and shipbuild¬
ing) is in the hands of private enterprise, as are the construction and distribu¬
tive and other service industries.
Most of the energy, transport and communications industries are in public
sector ownership.
The largest organisations in terms of employees in 1979 were public sector
corporations such as the Post Office (411,000) and the National Coal Board
(300,000) and companies such as BL, formerly British Leyland, (192,000),
General Electric Company (191,000), BAT Industries (153,000) and Imperial
Chemical Industries (151,000). The largest companies in terms of capital
employed (net assets) were British Petroleum (£8,400 million) and Shell
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
211
Production
Productivity
Transport and Trading (£5,600 million). Altogether more than 90 companies
registered in Britain each had net assets over £250 million; in terms of annual
sales four of the top 20 industrial groups in Europe were British.
Where profitable operation has become dependent on concentration and
economies of scale, regrouping has taken place. In some sectors a small number
of big companies and their subsidiaries are responsible for a great proportion of
total production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor
vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools,
brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares in
these companies are, however, usually distributed among many holders or are
held by insurance companies or pension funds representing a broad cross-
section of the community, and it is rare for a few holders to have a controlling
interest other than in the case of private companies. (See also p 231.)
Alongside these large organisations the many hundreds of thousands of
small firms play an essential part in the economy. The Government has taken a
number of measures to encourage existing small businesses and promote the
development of new ones (see p 228).
Industrial production was severely affected by the world recession in industry
in 1980, after rising between 1975 and 1979 (see Table 10). Mining and
quarrying output rose sharply up to 1979 owing to increased production of
North Sea oil and gas. Manufacturing output grew more gradually (see also
Table 14, p 236). In general, production industries are described in this book
on the basis of information up to the end of 1979.

The improvement of productivity, which by international standards has
shown a relatively slow rate of growth in Britain, is recognised as being of
prime importance for the economy. Productivity, as measured by output per
head, increased by 18 per cent in all production industries between 1975 and
1979 (see Table 11). In manufacturing the increase was 9*7 per cent and in
mining and quarrying (including North Sea oil and gas activity) 207 per cent.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity are influenced
by such factors as the rate of capital investment, management, advances in
products, machinery processes and methods of work, sales promotion and
labour. Over the last decade the size of the labour force employed in industry
has fallen steadily.
The improvement of productivity rests primarily with the management and
the workforce in individual enterprises. The Department of Industry provides
212
Investment
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
support by assisting the introduction of advanced machinery and techniques
into industry, providing technical advisory services and sponsoring the
Computer-Aided Design Centre and the National Computing Centre. It is
concerned directly with research into such factors as production engineering
and communication networks. The Department of Employment advises firms
on manpower utilisation, job satisfaction and industrial relations. Many educa¬
tional establishments also provide advice and assistance.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Council of Productivity Associations is one of many
bodies, both public and private, concerned with various aspects of productiv¬
ity. The Council provides information and advisory services to industry
through a national network of 28 local associations.

Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Details of investment in
the period 1974-79 are contained in Table 12 (see also p 235). The figures do
not include expenditure on the leasing of assets, a practice which grew rapidly
in the 1970s (see p 352).

Part of the investment in plant and machinery is associated with the intro¬
duction of new techniques and equipment. The progress of automation (see
below) is changing the pattern and organisation of many industries and has

Association
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY 213
brought substantial increases in production and efficiency. Much investment,
however, still consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more
traditional kind. Industrial technologies of plant maintenance, materials hand¬
ling, lubrication and corrosion protection, well developed in Britain, make
possible large savings in costs.
In Britain, as in other industrialised countries, automation has been steadily
extended to a wide range of industrial and commercial activities. Extensive use
of automation is to be found across the whole range of production industries,
including metal manufacture, the petroleum and chemical industries,
engineering, food, drink and tobacco manufacture, printing and publishing,
and power transmission; and in service industries such as transport, posts and
telecommunications, retailing, wholesale distribution and business and finan¬
cial services.
The growth of digital measurement and control techniques, including the
use of computers, has greatly extended the range for automatic operations; it is
now possible for an entire production process to be controlled automatically,
and for information to be provided rapidly for managerial, commercial and
technical purposes. Britain has many advanced applications of computer con¬
trol in operation in both the public and private sectors of industry, and is
among the world’s leading nations in the provision of ‘software’ services and
systems (that is, the preparation of instructions for computer operations and
related services).
The scope of electronic controls has been extended still further by the
development of micro-electronics, and in particular the microprocessor, a term
commonly used to refer to a miniature wafer or ‘chip’ (usually of silicon) about
5mm (0-2 inches) square, on which are placed electronic circuits equivalent to
those found in the central processing unit of a computer. The importance of
this development has been widely recognised in Britain, partly through
government initiatives, including a microprocessor awareness campaign aimed
at industrialists and trade unions. In addition financial support has been
provided for the micro-electronics industry, and for applications of micro¬
electronics. British companies are also improving the performance of opera¬
tions which are already automated by developing more comprehensive and
powerful control systems.
Voluntary associations are formed by private enterprises for a number of
different purposes, including the provision of common services, the exchange
of information and representation of their members’ point of view; the regula¬
tion of trading practices; and negotiation with trade unions on wages and
conditions of work. These associations cover, with varying completeness, most
of British industry. Trade associations, concerned mainly with representation
to the Government, the provision of common services and the regulation of
trading practices, are normally composed of firms manufacturing (and/or
retailing) a particular product or group of products. Employers’ organisations
which deal with employment matters usually consist of firms engaged in the
same type of operation or manufacturing process. In an industrial sector
concerned wholly with an allied group of products, one association may
undertake all the functions. The national employers’ organisations are usually
concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of work (see p 337).
The central body representing British business and industry nationally is
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government
as a channel for consultation between government departments and repre-
214
Management
Education
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sentatives of both the private and the public sector employers as a whole.
The CBI represents directly and indirectly more than 300,000 companies
through parent companies, subsidiaries, employers’ organisations, trade and
commercial associations and the majority of the nationalised industries. For its
members it acts as an advisory and consultative body providing them with
information and statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing
them nationally to the Government and the public and also internationally (see
P 338). CBI representatives sit on the National Economic Development Coun¬
cil, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and Safety Commission,
the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and other official advisory
committees and voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist to
promote the interests of local, regional and national industry and commerce.
Most chambers provide export facilities, including the sponsorship of outward
trade missions and visits. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is
the co-ordinating body to which about 85 local chambers are affiliated,
together with 21 British Chambers of Commerce operating in Europe and
elsewhere. The chambers operating in Britain have a membership of about
53,000 firms. In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the
Association of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland the
Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to which local cham¬
bers are affiliated. Other voluntary associations include industrial develop¬
ment associations for particular areas or regions, which are sponsored by local
authorities, trade associations and individual firms. Four of these bodies (the
North of England Development Council, the North West Industrial
Development Association, the Yorkshire and Humberside Development |
Association and the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau) receive )
government grants, while the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) is
funded by its constituent members without government grant and the
Development Corporation for Wales receives grants from the Welsh Develop- :
ment Agency.
In Britain, as elsewhere, it is recognised that managers require special skills
and training. The British Institute of Management (BIM), which is playing an
increasingly representative role for the management and administrative pro¬
fessions, provides a wide range of information services and has a particular
interest in management education and training. The Institute of Directors also
provides information and other services to directors of all types of company.
The Industrial Society, whose membership includes trade unions as well as
employers and their associations, works to promote better use of human
resources; it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
A large proportion of management education is provided by polytechnics
and many of the colleges of further education throughout Britain; 12 regional
centres of management education have been established in England and Wales
through the association of polytechnics and colleges which have high reputa¬
tions for management studies (see also p 167). Universities also make an
important contribution, especially the full-time postgraduate programmes at
the business schools of London and Manchester Universities. Training
courses for higher management are offered by several colleges including the
Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge College of
Management, Berkhamsted. The Council of Industry for Management Educa-

tion, jointly sponsored by the CBI, the BIM and the Foundation for Manage¬
ment Education, works to foster the development of business and management
education. Many firms provide general management courses for senior execu¬
tives or systems of informal training. There are also a number of bodies
concerned with specialised branches of management, for example, the Insti¬
tute of Personnel Management, the Institution of Industrial Managers, the
Institute of Administrative Management, the Institute of Supervisory
Management, the Institute of Marketing, the Institute of Chartered Sec¬
retaries and Administrators and the Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
The large number of professional people working as management consul¬
tants indicates the concern for improved management performance in Britain.
Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas clients.
(Industrial training and education below management level are summarised on
pp 331 and 167.)
Design is an important factor in improving the quality and competitiveness of
manufactured goods. Improvement of the design of British goods is the
concern of the government-sponsored Design Council and its separate Scottish
Committee, while the Computer-Aided Design Centre (see p 388) also pro¬
vides assistance to individual firms.
At the Council’s Design Centres in London and Glasgow there are perma¬
nent displays of well-designed modern British goods, together with special
exhibitions illustrating new design developments. There is a third, smaller
showroom in Cardiff. All the products displayed are chosen from the Council’s
Design Index, a record of some 7,000 current British products, chosen by
independent committees for their high standards of design, safety and
performance. The Council’s services include advice on design matters, the
organisation of product displays at overseas trade fairs, conferences and semi¬
nars on design, help for design education and the publication of a range of
material. It provides annual awards for manufacturers of consumer and
engineering products and for medical equipment and motor vehicles.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p 393), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers, and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design in
industry. The Crafts Council, the British Crafts Centre, and the Scottish Craft
Centre are grant-aided and work to improve craft design by, for example,
organising regular exhibitions and other events (see also p 408).
There is a substantial body of legislation designed to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions relating to manufacture, new industrial designs and
trade marks. These matters are administered respectively by the Patent Office,
the Design Registry and the Trade Marks Registry, while governmental
responsibility is exercised by the Department of Trade. It is also open to
British residents to apply for protection under international agreements such
as the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty, both
of which came into effect in 1978. International protection for patents, designs
and trade marks is available under the International Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter, funded in part by sale of standards, by
2l6

subscription and by government grant. It prepares and promulgates standards
which, variously, specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing
methods and codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in
most fields of production. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manu¬
facturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the I
specification of requirements. BSI is governed by an executive board which
includes representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers,
professional institutions, consumers and the larger government departments.
The British Calibration Service (BCS) was established in 1966 in response
to the growth in demand for industrial calibration services, which was begin¬
ning to exceed the capacity of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, see p
388), Britain’s national calibration authority. The BCS, which is a service of
the NPL, is an organisation of over 80 laboratories, located in industry,
universities and government establishments which offers ‘authenticated calib¬
rations traceable to national standards’, a phrase which means that
measurements are made within a known and approved uncertainty and with
instruments which are calibrated directly by the NPL or against secondary
standards which are themselves calibrated by NPL. BCS laboratories issue
calibration certificates for electrical, mechanical, flow, optical, pressure,
thermal and time interval measurements; the range covers those essential to
quality, efficiency and safety in manufacturing and process industries. The
BCS has provided a model which several other countries have followed. As a
complement to the BCS, a national testing laboratory accreditation scheme is
to be set up in 1981 which will provide official recognition of the competence of
laboratories to undertake defined types of test.
The following is a summary of how British industry is distributed through the
eight standard regions of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is one of the
world’s most important financial and tourist centres. Lying at the head of
ocean navigation on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities
and largest ports, though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to
Tilbury docks. It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufacture
of ladies’ clothing, materials for the arts, precision instruments, jewellery, and
many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these
industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the
central area) is well below the national average. London is also important,
especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and consumer
goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of leading research
establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a considerable drop
in employment and population. The regeneration of the dockland areas is one
of a number of projects being implemented to attract new industry.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are .]
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. High technology industries are well represented
in Berkshire and Hertfordshire, and Chelmsford is an important centre for the
electronics industry. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are
large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works and

major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries. 1'here are
centres of manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, Slough and Read¬
ing, in the Medway towns and the Aldershot-Farnborough area. Heathrow
and Gatwick airports are of major importance and are large employers.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, many of which are partly residential areas for people working in
London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a naval port with some
shipbuilding and general manufacturing. Southampton is one of Britain’s
leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries include ship
repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports. Brighton, apart from being an
important holiday, residential and conference centre, is a university town and
has important manufacturing plant.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol is the region’s
administrative and commercial centre, and the largest industrial city, having
tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace, chocolate, chemicals and
non-ferrous metal manufactures as well as a wide range of engineering, elec¬
tronic and other industries. There are extensive modern docks, including the
Royal Portbury Dock and Avonmouth. Fast rail and road links connect Bristol
with other major commercial and industrial centres.
Plymouth, with the naval dockyard and electrical and other industries, is an
important manufacturing centre. The towns of Gloucester, Poole, Christ¬
church, Cheltenham and Bath are major producers of machinery, instrumen¬
tation and other engineering products. Swindon has vehicle, electrical and
electronic engineering, and has recently attracted a number of major service
industries. Helicopters and leather are produced at Yeovil and chemical and
engineering products are made at Taunton and Bridgwater. Clothing and
other textile products and footwear are made at several centres. In the Cam¬
borne, Redruth, Falmouth and St. Austell areas of Cornwall there is china clay
and tin mining, machinery manufacture, and other forms of engineering.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this
growth was made by a scheme under which nine towns absorbed an overspill of
population and industry from London. The area is one of the most productive
agricultural regions in the world and this has provided a firm base for the
growth of the food processing industry, which is concerned mainly with
canning, and more recently freezing local produce. Cambridge is a major
centre of research-based industry; Ipswich and Peterborough are noted for
diesel engines, agricultural machinery and engineering generally and Norwich
for footwear and food manufacture. Cambridge, Ipswich and Norwich have
become increasingly important as centres for service industries. The east coast
ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft are important bases for companies
associated with natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
This is the only landlocked region and it has a greater dependency on manufac¬
turing industry than any other region. However, more than three-quarters of
the land is still used for agriculture and includes some areas of great natural
beauty, particularly in the south and west. The National Agricultural Centre
is based at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. The main concentration of industry
is in the West Midlands metropolitan county which includes the districts

of Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolver¬
hampton. The economy is largely dependent upon the metal-using industries
and in particular on motor vehicle manufacture. Other notable industries are
mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, castings, tubes, locks,
jewellery, domestic metalware and rubber manufactures. The metropolitan
county also contains the National Exhibition Centre, which is one of the largest
and most modern exhibition complexes in the world.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region’s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal¬
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and north Warwickshire areas.
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical
engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
Although some major industries are heavily concentrated in the East Midlands
(over 60 per cent of Britain’s hosiery and knitwear, 40 per cent of its footwear
and more than 20 per cent of its coal) industry is well diversified. North
Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire are traditional coalmining areas where pro¬
ductivity rates are high. In the northern part of the region engineering is also
important. In Nottingham a high proportion of employment is in pharmaceut¬
icals, electronics, tobacco and bicycle manufacture. Nottingham lace is famous
throughout the world, but textiles and clothing are of more importance. Derby
is primarily an engineering town with aero-engines, rail rolling stock, boilers
and castings among a wide range of engineering products. The production of
man-made fibres is also of considerable importance. Agriculture is significant
in Lincolnshire as well as food processing and engineering, much of which
produces agricultural and constructional equipment. Lincoln has a substantial
engineering industry. Engineering is also a major industry in Leicester, much
of it supplying other local industries such as textiles and footwear. Electrical
engineering is of especial importance in Loughborough. Northamptonshire is
famous for high-quality footwear. In recent years light engineering, much of it
related to the electronics industry, has expanded considerably.
The North West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Depart¬
ment of Industry’s administration of this region extends also into parts of
Cumbria and Derbyshire. The region is one of the most highly industrialised
in Britain. Manchester is Britain’s second most important commercial and
financial centre. It is one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy engineer¬
ing and for the production of a wide range of goods including computers,
electronic equipment, petrochemicals, clothing, dye-stuffs and pharmaceuti¬
cals. Manchester’s traditional role as the centre for the Lancashire textile
industry is only a small part of its present-day activities.
The textile towns, while adapting to the decline of traditional textiles and to
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have for the most part seen engineering outgrow the textile indus¬
try. The largest towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston,
Rochdale, Burnley, Wigan and Bury, are diversified with such industries as
Yorkshire and
Humberside
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY 2IQ
paper-making, textile and electrical machinery, light engineering and con¬
sumer durables, plastics, foods, chemicals, nuclear process plant, electronics,
aircraft and heavy commercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington, with
its new town, Widnes, Runcorn, also a new town, with the chemical industry,
and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the
Mersey estuary. St. Helens to the north of the canal, has become the world’s
leading centre of the flat glass industry. Liverpool, with its modernised dock
system, is one of Britain’s leading seaports and, after London, the largest
centre for processing and converting imported foodstuffs and raw materials
(grain milling, oils, fats and tobacco, sugar refining and rubber products).
Much of economic activity in Merseyside is still centred on its port, but its
industrial strength has moved from older industries closely related to the port
to the newer industries including motor vehicles, electrical and electronic
engineering, industrial plant and machinery and chemicals.
To the north of this industrial belt lie Southport, Blackpool and Lancaster
with light industries and seaside tourist trade, and to the south, the Cheshire
plain with agriculture, while a variety of industries such as salt, chemicals,
motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and rail engineering are located among the
smaller towns.
The region contains some of Britain’s most fertile farmland. The large
tourist industry has the attractions of the coast, historic towns such as Chester,
and the four National Parks on or near its boundaries.
Manchester airport with its international and inter-continental services is
second in England only to the London airports. Liverpool also has a busy
airport. The region has a highly developed rail system and one of the most
advanced motorway networks in Britain, providing fast access to London and
the rest of the country, and to continental Europe through the east coast ports,
as well as throughout the region itself.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country, forming one of Britain’s
major agricultural areas.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. About 70 per cent of Britain’s
worsted and woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the
commercial centre of the wool trade. In addition there are strong sectors of
engineering, printing and carpets. The metropolitan district of Leeds is an
important commercial centre and also has a variety of industries including
men’s clothing and various engineering industries. In the south, the steel
centre based on Sheffield and Rotherham is noted for the manufacture of high
quality steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s coalfields are particularly import¬
ant and production is to be extended to the Selby area, where major new
reserves have been discovered. Doncaster, with tractor and wire rope manufac¬
turing, and Barnsley are the largest towns on the coalfield where dependence
on steel and coal has been reduced by the introduction of new industries in and
around the major towns.
North Yorkshire is mainly agricultural but York, a leading tourist attraction,
is also noted for chocolate and confectionery manufacture. It is an important
railway centre, and has substantial railway workshops, besides being the home
of the National Railway Museum.
Kingston upon Hull is the principal industrial town in Humberside, which
is a major centre for maritime trade with ports at Grimsby, Immingham and
220
Northern
Wales

Goole in addition to Hull. Besides being fishing ports, Hull and Grimsby
contain specialised food processing and cold storage facilities. The Humber
ports are strategically situated for direct access to Western Europe, while the
Humber Bridge (see p 303) will improve domestic communications. The
British Steel Corporation has a large steel plant at Scunthorpe. Also in south
Humberside are chemical, fertiliser, oil refining, and food processing plants.
The north bank of the Humber contains a large proportion of Britain’s caravan
manufacturing industry.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and
the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an area
of mountains, lakes and moorland. The tourist industry, already strong in the
Lake District, is developing in other areas. Industrial activity and the bulk of
the population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from the
coalfields north of the River Tyne southwards to the River Tees, and to a lesser
extent, on the western coastal strip of Cumbria.
The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufac¬
ture, shipbuilding and ship-repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical
plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe).
Major investment at Teesside has increased steelmaking capacity to nearly 5
million tonnes a year. New industries, however, with a broader technological
base, have been attracted to the region and the industrial structure is becoming
more diversified. Manufacture of electrical plant is a major industry.
Other industries include electric components, plastics, domestic appliances,
pharmaceuticals, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing and scientific
instruments as well as mining machinery, rolling mill plant and earth-moving
equipment. An aluminium smelter is operating on the Northumberland coast.
Atomic energy is important, with two nuclear power stations and other instal¬
lations in Cumbria, and a further nuclear power station at an advanced stage of
construction at Hartlepool. Considerable investment is taking place in the
coalmining industry to exploit large coal reserves below the sea bed off the
Northumberland and Durham coasts and to boost open-cast coal production.
The region is also involved in the North Sea oil programme. The new oil
terminal at Teesside has a potential capacity of one million barrels a day of
North Sea oil. A major new reservoir at Kielder will, when completed, provide
water supplies for industry on Tyneside and Teesside.
Some two-thirds of the population (which totals 2-8 million) live in indus¬
trial south Wales. This area has a diverse range of modern manufacturing
industries, including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicles
components, plastics, chemicals and textiles. Though coalmining has
declined substantially, the south Wales coalfield still produces virtually all
Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. Steel, the
other traditional industry of south Wales, is less dominant in employment
terms than formerly but still supplies all of Britain’s tinplate and much of its
sheet steel. Cardiff, Newport and Swansea are the largest urban centres and,
with Barry and Port Talbot, are also the major ports of the region. This latter
has one of the largest steel-making plants in Britain and a deep water harbour
for importing iron ore. Milford Haven is one of the finest natural deep water
harbours in the world and has developed as Britain’s major oil-importing port
with four oil refineries and a link with a fifth at Llandarcy.
The other main industrial area is in north-east Wales. Coalmining has now
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
221
Scotland
contracted in importance but steel finishing, chemicals, man-made fibres and
aircraft construction remain significant sources of employment despite some
shedding of labour in recent years. A range of new lighter industry has been
introduced in the post-war years, particularly around Wrexham. The remain¬
der of Wales is predominantly rural with agriculture, forestry and tourism the
traditional basis of the economy, but here too manufacturing firms have been
introduced in many towns, and one or two very large scale undertakings such as
an aluminium plant at Holyhead, Anglesey, have been established.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5-2 million and most of the
industrial activity is concentrated in the central lowlands between the Firth of
Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a
major industrial and commercial centre, and Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, an
administrative, financial and cultural centre. There is a wide variety of manu¬
facturing industries. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuild¬
ing and marine engineering centre; it produces a great variety of general
engineering products, which include platform modules, pumps and other
products for the offshore oil and gas industries.
Clydeside is also an important centre for food, drink and tobacco manufac¬
tures, carpets and printing and publishing. The steel industry, sited mainly in
Central Strathclyde, has been substantially modernised. There are important
coalmining works in the Strathclyde, Central, Lothian and Fife regions. The
computer and electronics equipment industry is strongly represented in
Strathclyde, Fife and Dundee, as well as in Edinburgh, where this and other
modern industries are expanding alongside the traditional engineering, print¬
ing and publishing and brewing industries. Large-scale plants producing cars
in Linwood, near Paisley, and commercial vehicles in West Lothian and the
Scotstoun district of Glasgow, are well established, while heavy earth-moving
equipment and tracked vehicles are produced in Uddingston and Airdrie. The
chemical industry is concentrated in Ayrshire and at Grangemouth, where
there is also a major oil refinery. The Firth of Clyde provides central Scotland
with valuable deep water facilities.
North-east Scotland is now the centre of the offshore oil industry and a wide
variety of oil-related projects have been established. Aberdeen, one of two
main industrial cities outside the central belt, has additionally become the chief
servicing and administrative centre for the oil industry. In June 1978 between
60,000 and 70,000 people were employed in Scotland as a whole in work
directly or indirectly related to oil and the total has risen since then. However,
the older industries in the north-east (whisky distilling, paper manufacture and
food and fish processing) continue to flourish.
Elsewhere outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentra¬
tion in and around Dundee, where the traditional manufacture, jute, has been
supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches, tyres and electronic
products. Numerous smaller towns outside the central lowlands have also
attracted light industry in recent years.
Much of the rest of Scotland is mountainous and therefore sparsely popu¬
lated. In the Highlands and Islands, the main industries include high quality
tweed and knitwear, papermaking and aluminium smelting and there are
significant resources of hydro-electric power. Nuclear power is also generated.
The development of North Sea oil has led to very substantial oil-related
activities including oil platform production yards. The oil terminal at Sullom
Voe, Shetland, which became operational in 1978, is the largest in Europe. In
the Borders and south-west of Scotland, the wool, cloth and knitwear

industries are important, together with food processing and chemicals manu¬
facture. Tourism is important throughout Scotland and there are extensive
holiday and recreational facilities.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small there is substantial
and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around Belfast, the capital
city, and Londonderry. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast; other
well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machin¬
ery and a wide range of other engineering products, tobacco and clothing.
Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles; the textile
industry is extensively diversified and Northern Ireland is an important area
for man-made fibre production, providing a substantial portion of Britain’s
output. There has also been extensive development in vehicle components,
oil-well equipment, electronic instruments, telecommunication equipment,
carpets and synthetic rubber.
THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY
The chief aim of the industrial policy of the Government elected in 1979 is to
encourage industrial enterprise and initiative in a flexible and competitive
market economy. Steps have been taken to reduce the extent of state ownership
(see p 203), a review of industrial subsidies has been carried out (see p 226) and
industrial investment agencies in the public sector have been encouraged to
secure private sector participation in their projects. Competition policy (see p
231) has been strengthened in order to create a climate in which commerce can
flourish. The Government also aims to stimulate the development of small
businesses (see p 228) by reducing the administrative burdens laid on them and
through taxation and other policies.
The departments chiefly responsible for the Government’s relations with
industry are the Department of Industry (responsible for manufacturing and
for industrial research and design), the Department of Energy, the Depart¬
ment of Trade (aviation, shipping, tourism, printing and publishing and the
distributive and service industries), the Department of Transport (inland
transport), the Department of the Environment (construction and water
supply), and the appropriate departments of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern
Ireland Offices.
The Government also has close relations with industry through the National
Economic Development Council (see p 203), subcommittees of which bring
together representatives of the Government, the Bank of England, the
nationalised industries, managements and trade unions to make recommenda¬
tions on certain industrial sectors and on various aspects of industry.
Official recognition of outstanding industrial performance is conferred by
the Queen’s Awards for Export and Technology which are made annually to
firms in all sectors of industry (including services) on the advice of a committee
composed of businessmen, trade union representatives and civil servants.
Direct state participation in industry is mainly effected through public
corporations sponsored by government departments and responsible for par¬
ticular sectors of industrial activity. Such corporations are responsible for most
of Britain’s energy and transport sectors and for several within manufacturing;
their activities are described in the relevant chapters.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not
generally civil servants and although accountable to Parliament for their
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY 223
actions in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for management.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of
the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, has power to give general directions as to how the
industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management. It is
usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any information,
statistics and financial accounts which may be required. In practice, as the
responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are
reached in consultation, there is very seldom occasion for a general directive to
be issued. Indeed, the Government’s policy is to keep ministerial intervention
to a minimum and to encourage the nationalised industries to behave as far as
possible as commercial enterprises.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial
targets have been agreed by the Government for certain industries and targets
for the remaining industries are to be set as soon as possible. The main form of
target, usually set for three to five years, is a real return before interest on
average net assets femployed. Finance for capital expenditure which cannot be
found from internal sources is provided mainly by interest-bearing loans from
the Exchequer. Other sources of finance include grants and Public Dividend
Capital on which dividends are paid to the Government.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is done for certain of the industries (see p 233)
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider com¬
plaints and suggestions, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes
they think desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. Provision is
also made for the examination of the affairs of the nationalised industries
within the parliamentary committee system.
Regional
Development
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years of older industries, such as steel-making and
shipbuilding, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of
regional imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Finan¬
cial and other aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has
been expanded considerably over the years.
Assisted Areas In parts of Great Britain designated as ‘assisted areas’ incentives are offered by
the Government to encourage industrial development and the growth of office

and other service employment. (Northern Ireland is covered by separate
legislation; see p 227.) There are three categories of assisted area: special
development areas, where the economic situation and consistently high rates of
unemployment give rise to the most urgent need for assistance; development
areas with similar but rather less severe problems; and the intermediate area,
where some assistance is necessary but where the need is relatively less acute
than in the other types of area. Following a review carried out by the Depart¬
ment of Industry in 1979 the Government decided to continue with an active
but more selective policy, at the same time maintaining reasonable stability in
the framework of regional investment incentives and avoiding abrupt changes.
At the time of the review the assisted areas covered more than 40 per cent of the
working population; it was proposed that, over a transitional period of three
years, this should be reduced to about 25 per cent in order to concentrate the
available resources more effectively on them, and to treat different parts of the
country more consistently and fairly. A few areas were upgraded in July 1979
to take account of changed circumstances. The first downgradings took effect
from 1 August 1980 and further downgradings are proposed for 1 August 1982
at the end of the transitional period (see maps on pp 224-225).
Under the Industry Act 1972 regional development grants are available in
special development and development areas towards the costs of new plant,
machinery, buildings and works provided on premises used wholly or mainly
for specified manufacturing activities. These grants are not limited to projects
creating employment, and are thus available to help with improvements and
modernisation. They are not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which
qualifies for tax allowances. For new projects the rate of grant is 22 per cent in
the special development areas and 15 per cent in the development areas.
The Act also provides for regional selective assistance for projects which are
likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part of the assisted
area. Assistance is normally provided in the form of a grant related to the
number of jobs involved and paid in instalments.
In addition modern factories for rent or purchase may be provided in many
parts of the assisted areas. Firms in the development and special development
areas are given preferential treatment when tendering for contracts placed by
government departments and nationalised industries.
Special measures to improve the infrastructure in the assisted areas include
provisions under the Local Employment Act 1972 for grants towards the
improvement of basic services (such as transport, power and water facilities)
and towards the acquisition and clearance of derelict land (see p 182).
The Government also influences the location of industry by requiring indus¬
trial development certificates before planning permission can be sought for the
building of new factories (or for extensions to existing ones) above prescribed
limits outside the assisted areas of Great Britain. Other government policies
affecting the location of industry, including the establishment of the new
enterprise zones, are described on p 178.
The Department of Industry takes a lead in the formulation of regional
industrial policy and administers the regional development grant scheme
throughout Great Britain. The Scottish and Welsh Offices however, adminis¬
ter regional selective assistance in Scotland and Wales.
In England the regional offices of the Department of Industry in the main

assisted areas (the North, North West and Yorkshire and Humberside offices)
deal with applications for regional selective assistance where projects costs are
less than £10 million, and can authorise grants of up to £2 million without
reference to the Department’s headquarters. The delegated powers of the
South West, East Midlands and West Midlands offices are less extensive but
enable them to deal with most applications they receive. The Secretary of State
for Industry has access to advice from the Industrial Development Advisory
Board, a statutory body composed of prominent members of the industrial and
financial community, which makes recommendations on industrial oppor¬
tunities and on applications for selective financial assistance. Non-statutory
industrial development boards have also been established for the North, North
West, South West and Yorkshire and Humberside regions. The English
Industrial Estates Corporation is responsible for government factories and
those built in partnership with the private sector in the English assisted areas.
In Scotland and Wales, day-to-day work is carried out by the Scottish
Economic Planning Department and by the Industry Department of the Welsh
Office. Statutory Scottish and Welsh Industrial Development Advisory
Boards advise the respective Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. The
Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies (see p 228) are responsible for the
provision of factories for rent or purchase and are also concerned with the
reclamation of derelict land.
Under separate legislation (the Industries Development Acts 1966 and 1971,
as amended in 1976) the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce offers a
full range of incentives comparable to those available in the assisted areas of
Great Britain.
All firms establishing factories in Northern Ireland, without regard to the
number of jobs created, are eligible for capital grants at the rate of 30 per cent of
the cost of new buildings, machinery and equipment; for grants towards
training and free use of government training services; for grants towards the
cost of transferring key workers; and for the derating of industrial buildings by
75 per cent. The capital grants, like regional development grants in Great
Britain, are not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which qualifies for
tax allowances. Projects which are especially attractive because of the number
of jobs created can obtain special benefits which include industrial develop¬
ment grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new buildings, machinery and
equipment (as an alternative to capital grants); contributions towards setting¬
up costs; modern factories for rent or purchase; and loans, loan guarantees and
interest relief grants.
Industrial development certificates (see p 226) are not required in Northern
Ireland.
Grants of up to 50 per cent are available for research and development
projects up to a maximum of £250,000 for any one project.
Assistance is also available to firms in the service sector which have a genuine
choice of location within Britain and which create additional net employment.
Projects serving primarily local needs are not assisted. The forms of aid
available to the manufacturing sector may also be offered to service sector
projects. The Northern Ireland Development Agency may also assist finan¬
cially with industrial development projects.
While the Government encourages the private sector to generate its own funds
for investment in industry, there is a national system of official incentives for
industrial development. Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage
228

capital expenditure in plant and machinery take the form of a system of free
depreciation enabling the whole of such expenditure to be written off against
profits for tax purposes in the year in which it is incurred; there is in addition a
54 per cent initial allowance on new industrial buildings and structures and an
annual writing down allowance of 4 per cent thereafter. Corporation tax relief
on the inflationary increase in the value of stocks is also allowed (see p 354).
Direct financial assistance, in the form of grants and loans, is available in a
number of ways. In addition to regional development assistance (see above),
aid may be provided throughout Britain under the Industry Acts 1972 and
I975 where it is judged to be in the national interest. High technology
developments in industry are eligible for support under the Science and
Technology Act 1965. Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged,
and overseas firms are offered the same facilities and incentives as those
applying to British-owned companies. Official aid for exporters is also avail¬
able (see p 375).
Certain Government agencies promote areas of Britain to investors. In Scot¬
land this is done by the Scottish Development Agency, and in Wales by the
Welsh Development Agency. Both agencies may also provide investment
funds and promote new ventures (although they are expected to encourage
maximum private sector participation in their projects), and they have respon¬
sibilities relating to factory building, land reclamation (see p 226) and small
firms (see below). In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Development
Agency has a similar role, although other agencies are responsible for factory
building, land reclamation and small firms.
The National Enterprise Board (NEB) is a public corporation which acts as
a state holding company and has certain limited investment functions. Under
revised guidelines issued in 1980 the NEB has an investment role in certain
defined circumstances in relation to: companies in which it already has an
interest; companies engaged in the development of, or exploitation of,
advanced technologies; companies carrying on an industrial undertaking
which is wholly or mainly in the assisted areas in England; and loans of up to
£50,000 to small firms. The NEB, also, must have regard to the need to attract
private investment.
The Department of Industry has a separate division which is the focal point for
the formation of policy towards small firms. In association with the Scottish
and Welsh Offices, the division administers a chain of small firms centres
throughout Great Britain which provide an information and counselling ser¬
vice for small businessmen. Other government measures to assist small firms
include tax concessions (see p 354) and experimental schemes to provide
premises and new sources of venture capital.
Assistance for small firms is also provided by the development agencies and
the NEB and by the agencies for rural industry (see below). In Northern
Ireland the Local Enterprise Development Unit, established to promote the
development of smaller industries, provides grants, loans, premises and
management advice to new and expanding companies.
Encouragement for the development of rural industries in England is provided
under the aegis of the Development Commission set up in 1909. Through the
agency of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas (CoSIRA), the
commission provides managerial and technical advice, training facilities and a
credit service to small manufacturing and service industries in rural areas.

Loans and advice are also provided for small tourism enterprises in the rural
parts of the development areas and in the Commission’s special investment
areas. In addition the Commission provides factory premises in rural areas and
lends support for pioneering and experimental schemes bearing on the rural
economy, for voluntary bodies aiming to enrich social and cultural life in the
countryside, and for surveys and other work in rural areas.
In Scotland and Wales these services are provided by the Scottish and Welsh
Development Agencies. Separate bodies, however, cater for particular rural
areas. In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
Act of Parliament in 1965, provides assistance to the Highland region, and
surrounding islands, and to parts of the Strathclyde region. It provides grants
and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, builds factories, and has
powers to acquire land and set up businesses. The Development Board for
Rural Wales has the general function of promoting and undertaking measures
for economic and social development in the county of Powys and the districts of
Meirionnydd and Ceredigion. It has a particular responsibility for new towns
in those areas and can acquire land, carry out building and provide basic
services. Within its area the board owns and manages government estates and
factories and also acts as agent for the Welsh Development Agency in the
provision of investment finance for small firms.
Government support and assistance for the tourist industry is provided under
the Development of Tourism Act 1969. The Act established four grant-aided
statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is responsible for the
overseas promotion of tourism to Great Britain and has a general responsibility
for tourism within Great Britain, and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist
Boards which are responsible for promoting tourism in their respective
countries within Great Britain and for encouraging and assisting the develop¬
ment and improvement of accommodation and of facilities and amenities for
tourists. Each national board administers a scheme of financial assistance for
selected tourist projects in the assisted areas. In Scotland the Highlands and
Islands Development Board also assists the tourist industry. It is the
Government’s policy to encourage the industry in areas which could benefit
from it, particularly in the assisted areas, thus relieving congestion in the more
popular tourist centres. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board, established
under separate legislation, has a function broadly similar to that of other
British tourist boards except that financial assistance to tourism projects is only
available from Northern Ireland Department of Commerce.
European Community regional policy has two major aims—the reduction of
existing regional imbalances and the prevention of new imbalances arising
from the adoption of Community policies. Although the principal responsi¬
bility for helping depressed areas remains with the national authorities con¬
cerned, the Community may complement schemes through aid from a number
of sources.
The Regional Development Fund is the principal European Community
instrument for regional development and assists regions affected by industrial
change, structural under-employment and an over-reliance on agriculture.
The fund offers support for public works contributing to the improvement of
the regional infrastructure, for example, the building of new roads, ports or
industrial estates, and also for the development of tourism. The rate of grant is
usually between 10 and 30 per cent of the investment incurred by public

authorities, but may increase to 40 per cent for projects of particular import¬
ance to the region concerned.
The fund also offers support for investments in industrial, handicraft or
service activities which benefit from national regional aids and which create or
maintain at least ten jobs. The fund contribution may be up to 50 per cent of
the regional aids paid to an approved project provided that this does not exceed
20 per cent of the fixed investment costs and subject to a cost-per-job limit. In
the case of services and handicrafts this 20 per cent can be exceeded provided
that the contribution does not exceed 50 per cent of the national aid or a
cost-per-job allowance.
Britain’s share of the fund in the period 1975-79 was J^4I3 million. In 1979
the fund was given authority to finance specific measures to assist in the
implementation of European Community policies in other fields or to offset
any adverse regional consequences these may have. There is an allocation of 5
per cent of the total fund for these purposes.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a self-governing institution set up by
the Treaty of Rome with member states of the European Community subscrib¬
ing to its capital. The Bank’s aims are to help to stimulate development in less
favoured regions, to modernise or convert industries, to help to create new
activities and to offset structural difficulties affecting certain sectors. The Bank
also serves projects of common interest to several member states or the Euro¬
pean Community as a whole, for example, by reducing dependence on
imported energy sources or improving communications between member
states. It can lend up to 50 per cent of the fixed capital costs of projects. Loans
are normally for seven to ten years at fixed interest rates and are made in
mixtures of foreign currencies, mainly dollars and deutschemarks.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) makes loans to companies
in the coal and steel industries, and for projects in any industry which contri¬
butes to the redeployment of redundant coal and steel workers. Non-repayable
aid may be available for workers who have been made redundant. The aid
consists of the payment of tide-over and re-settlement allowances to workers
and financing the retraining of workers having to change their employment.
The ECSC can lend up to 50 per cent of the fixed capital costs of projects.
Loans are normally for eight years at fixed interest rates and are made in a
mixture of dollars and deutschemarks.
Exchange risk cover may be available on EIB and certain ECSC loans to
private sector borrowers in the assisted areas and Northern Ireland, provided
the projects concerned meet the criteria for regional selective assistance. Under
the scheme the British borrower takes on only a sterling liability; the Govern¬
ment carries the exchange risk in return for an annual premium on the
outstanding balance of the loan.
COMPETITION POLICY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
A major feature of the Government’s economic policy is the stimulation of
competition and the control of practices which are restrictive or anti¬
competitive. Linked to this policy is the encouragement of fair trading, with
the particular aim of helping consumers and safeguarding their rights. The
Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, who is answerable to the Secretary of
State for Trade, has special responsibilities for competition policy and con-

sumer affairs (although certain matters, such as safety of foodstuffs and road
vehicles, are the concern of other departments).
The Office of Fair Trading, a government agency headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading, is concerned with the conduct of trade and industry
in Britain.
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
and regulating monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive practices and restrictive
trade practices and of powers to regulate any structural changes or anti¬
competitive practices which operate against the public interest. The Director
General of Fair Trading administers the Fair Trading Act 1973, which regu¬
lates monopolies and mergers, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which
regulates restrictive trading agreements and the Competition Act 1980, which
regulates anti-competitive practices.
The Secretary of State for Trade and the Director General of Fair Trading can
refer monopolies for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commis¬
sion. The legislation defines a monopoly as a situation where at least a quarter
of a particular kind of goods or service is supplied by or to a single person, or
two or more people acting in a common manner. Local monopolies and
arrangements which prevent, restrict or distort competition, and monopolies
in public sector industries can also be referred to the Commission. If the
Commission finds that a monopoly operates against the public interest, the
Secretary of State for Trade has powers to make orders and otherwise
to remedy or prevent the harm which the Commission considers may
exist. It is more usual, however, for the Director General to be asked to
negotiate undertakings to remedy the adverse effects identified by the
Commission.
Proposals for a merger (defined as occurring when two or more enterprises
are brought under common ownership or control) may be referred to the
Commission by the Secretary of State for Trade if it would result in or intensify
a monopoly or if the total value of gross assets taken over exceeds £15 million. If
the Commission finds that a merger or proposed merger may be expected to
operate against the public interest, the Secretary of State can prevent it from
taking place or, if it has already taken place, require it to be reversed. There are
special provisions relating to newspaper and certain other mergers.
The Competition Act 1980 strengthens the powers of the Director General and
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to deal with practices, other than
registrable restrictive agreements (see p 232), which are anti-competitive.
Subject to certain exemptions, the Director General can investigate any prac¬
tice carried out by a business (whether in the public or private sector) which
may restrict, distort or prevent competition in the production, supply or
acquisition of goods or services in Britain. If an anti-competitive practice is
found, the Director General can suggest that it be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission to establish whether it operates against the public
interest. As an alternative the Director General can accept an undertaking
from the business responsible for the practice. On an adverse finding by
the Commission, the Secretary of State has powers to take remedial action.
The Act also empowers the Secretary of State to refer to the Commission
any question on the efficiency and costs of, the service provided by, or the
possible abuse of a monopoly situation by particular named bodies in the
public sector.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 restrictive trading agreements
have to be registered with the Director General of Fair Trading. Broadly, an
agreement is registrable if two or more parties to it engaged in business in
Britain in the supply of goods or services accept some limitation on their
freedom to make their own decisions about matters such as prices or conditions
of sale. Failure to register an agreement means that the restrictions are void and
the parties are liable to legal proceedings. Having placed an agreement on the
register, the Director General has the duty of referring it to the Restrictive
Practices Court and the Court must declare the restrictions in it contrary to the
public interest unless the parties can satisfy the Court by reference fo criteria
laid down in the Act that this is not the case. Restrictions declared contrary to
the public interest are void and the Court can order the parties not to give effect
to them or make any similar agreement. In practice, however, many agree¬
ments do not need to be referred to the Court because, for example, the parties
choose to give up the restrictions rather than go to Court, or the Secretary of
State accepts the Director General’s advice that the restrictions are not signifi¬
cant enough to warrant reference to the Court.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition in trade between member countries. The
Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of Rome,
apply to industrial and commercial practices likely to affect trade and prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the Community. Agreements which fall
within the rules must be notified to the European Commission, which has its
own Competition Department; the Commission has powers to exempt agree¬
ments which, though restrictive of competition between member countries,
benefit the Community in defined ways.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs, for
action to deal with both trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’
interests and persistent offenders under existing law, and for the negotiation of
self-regulatory codes of practice to raise trading standards.
The consumer’s interests with regard to the purity of foods, the description
and performance of goods, and pricing information are safeguarded by the
Food and Drugs Acts 1955 and 1956, the Trades Descriptions Acts 1968 and
1972, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Sale of Goods Act 1979.
The marking and accuracy of quantities are regulated by the Weights and
Measures Acts 1963 and i979> the latter introducing a system of average
weights for certain pre-packed goods. The other major area of legislation is
concerned with the prevention of the sale of dangerous or harmful consumer
goods. The principal laws here are the Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and
I97I> and the Consumer Safety Act 197^* which empower the Government to
make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods and to prohibit the
supply of any goods which are deemed to be unsafe.
Provision of consumer information and advice is an important function of
those in local and central Government, and of several independent organisa¬
tions concerned with consumer protection. The local outlets are the Citizens
Advice Bureaux (see p 152) and in some areas Consumer Advice Centres.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associ¬
ated councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), which also receives
government finance, ensures that the consumer’s view is made known to those
in Government and industry whose decisions affect consumers.
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
233
Consumer councils for the energy and rail nationalised industries and for the
Post Office investigate questions of concern to the consumer, while some trade
associations in industry and commerce have established codes of practice
designed to protect the consumer. In addition several private organisations
work to further consumer interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association,
funded by the subscriptions of its membership of over 600,000. The Associa¬
tion conducts an extensive programme of comparative testing of goods and
investigation of services; its views and test reports are published in its monthly
magazine Which? or its satellite publications. The Association also provides an
advice service on subscription. Consultancy work on European legislation is
undertaken by the Association for the Department of Trade. Local consumer
groups, many belonging to the National Federation of Consumer Groups, also
promote consumers’ interests and provide information and advice.
The European Community’s consumer programme covers a number of
important topics, such as health and safety, protection of the consumer’s
economic interests when purchasing goods and services, promotion of con¬
sumer education and strengthening the representation of consumers. The
views of British organisations interested in consumer affairs are represented at
community level by the European Community Group (UK).
COMPANY LAW
The formation and conduct of private sector corporations is regulated by the
Companies Acts (notably that of 1948, as amended). ‘Incorporation’ means
registering an enterprise with an official registrar of companies, with related
obligations such as the capital structure of a company, the rights and duties of
its directors and members, and the preparation of accounts. Nearly all corpo¬
rate businesses are ‘limited liability’ companies, which means that each
company is a legal entity distinct from its members, who are not as such liable
for its debts. Their liability is limited to contributing an amount related to their
shareholding. (In unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships or
partnerships, by contrast, individuals are personally liable for any debts a
business may incur.)
The European Community is pursuing a programme for the harmonisation
of company law among member states. In accordance with the programme the
Companies Act 1980 provides for new arrangements for the classification and
registration of companies and their capital structure and distribution of profits
and assets. The Act sets out new criteria for public companies (hitherto
defined only as those not meeting one or other of the tests for private com¬
panies) and defines private companies as those which are not public. It
continues to be the case that private companies may not offer shares to the
public. Following a review by the Government, the Act also lays down rules
concerning the conduct of company directors, and makes illegal share dealings
that depend upon certain privileged kinds of information.
Certain specialised types of private sector organisation such as banks, build¬
ing societies and insurance companies are subject to additional or alternative
statutory regulation.
B Manufacturing and
Service Industries
Manufacturing plays a vital role in the economy. It accounts for some 26 per
cent of gross domestic product; about 29 per cent of the employed labour force
is engaged in manufacturing; and around 77 per cent of visible exports consists
of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods.
The manufacturing industries are described by sector in this chapter,
together with the construction industry and the distributive and service indus¬
tries.
MANUFACTURING
Most manufacturing is carried out by private enterprise. Though the greater
parts of the iron and steel, shipbuilding and aerospace industries are in public
ownership, it is the Government’s general policy to reduce the extent of state
ownership of industry. Products from the state-controlled sector also include
locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways,
military equipment and supplies made in establishments of the defence ser¬
vices, and fissile materials and radioactive isotopes. The Government also has
shareholdings in a number of companies, including British Petroleum Ltd.,
Harland and Wolff Ltd., Rolls-Royce Ltd. and Short Brothers Ltd. Share¬
holdings in some companies, including BL Ltd., are held for the Government
by the National Enterprise Board.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Census of Production igyy. This shows that
some 69 per cent (74,852) of the 108,028 establishments in manufacturing
industry had fewer than 20 employees each and accounted for 7 per cent of total
employment; 30,721 establishments had between 20 and 499 employees and
accounted for some 39 per cent of the total labour force; 1,846 establishments,
each with between 500 and 1,499 employees, were responsible for 21 per cent
of employment; and one-third was in the hands of the 608 establishments each
with 1,500 or more employees. About 57 per cent of the largest establishments
were in the engineering, and metal and vehicle manufacturing industries. An
enterprise, as defined in the census, normally consists of either a single
establishment or of two or more establishments under common ownership. In
the private sector of British manufacturing industry in 1977 37 per cent of all
employment was accounted for by the largest 100 enterprises.
Output and The figures for manufacturing output in Tables 13 and 14 show the relative
Investment size of the sectors of manufacturing and their growth rates. Expansion up
to 1979 was evident in those industries using advanced technologies such as
electronics, instrument engineering, most sectors of the chemical industry and
paper, printing and publishing. A major stimulus has been provided by the
various needs of the offshore oil and gas industries. In other long-established
industries (for example, shipbuilding and marine engineering and electrical
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
235
engineering) extensive re-organisation, re-equipment and modernisation are
being undertaken to meet changing economic conditions. Production during
1980 was increasingly affected by the world-wide industrial recession.

Investment in manufacturing tends to reflect the level of demand in the
economy as a whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in
output and the implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked
cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since
1965 there have been three discernible cycles.
Total manufacturing investment in 1979 at current prices was £6,583
million, apportioned as follows: food, drink and tobacco £906 million, coal and
petroleum products £286 million, chemicals £1,172 million, metal manufac¬
ture £504 million, engineering, shipbuilding and metal goods £1,427 million,
vehicles £855 million, textiles, leather and clothing £353 million, paper,
printing and publishing £450 million and other manufacturing indus¬
tries £630 million. Analysed by type of asset, investment was divided into
£987 million for new building work, £473 million for vehicles and £5,123
million for plant and machinery. The growing practice of leasing rather
than purchasing new equipment is estimated to have contributed an extra
£750 million to manufacturing investment in 1979.

Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, today the world’s eighth largest steel-producing nation. The Iron and
Steel Act 1967 brought together into public ownership 14 major steel com¬
panies and created the British Steel Corporation (BSC). In recent years BSC
has produced about 82 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and is the largest steel
undertaking in Europe. It employs some 166,000 people, of whom 138,000 are
involved in iron and steel manufacturing and 28,000 in other activities, such as
chemicals and overseas consultancy. The remaining (private sector) com¬
panies are represented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Associa¬
tion whose members employ some 60,000 people and account for over a third
of the value of the industry’s turnover. The private sector is particularly strong
in the manufacture of alloy and stainless steels and of finished products for the
engineering industry. The main steel producing areas are Yorkshire and
Humberside (32 per cent of crude steel output in 1979), Wales (32 per cent),

the Northern region (15 per cent), Scotland (8 per cent) and the West Mid¬
lands (5 per cent).
About 75 per cent of British steel producers’ deliveries of finished steel
products are used by home industry and the remainder for direct export, the
major markets for which are the rest of the European Community and the
United States. A large part of the steel used by industry in Britain is also
subsequently exported as part of other finished products.
BSC has invested heavily in modernising its production capacity in recent
years. With the ending of steel-making at Shotton (north Wales), the obsolete
open hearth process has been entirely replaced by basic oxygen steel-making
(for bulk production) and the electric arc process (for more specialised tasks).
Bulk steel-making is concentrated at five main sites (Port Talbot and Llanwern
in south Wales, Ravenscraig near Glasgow, Redcar/Lackenby in Cleveland
and Scunthorpe, south Humberside) which have a good access to deep water
for imports of raw materials. Because of a marked fall in demand for steel, BSC
has had to accelerate the closure of its older steelworks and reduce capacity at
some of the more modern works.
The castings industry plays an important role in meeting the needs of manufac¬
turers for essential components for products sold both in Britain and abroad.
Its main customers are the vehicle, mechanical engineering and building and
construction industries. The larger mechanised foundries are dominant, but
many smaller craft foundries meet needs for specialised and low-volume
castings. Output (by volume) has been falling and the industry has been
progressively changing. While some foundries have been closing, many others
have been investing in new melting equipment, moulding equipment and
processes, and process and quality control equipment, both to meet demands
for castings of higher quality and strength and to improve working and
environmental conditions. The British Cast Iron Research Association and the
Steel Casting Research and Trade Association conduct much of the research
and development in the industry.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Its major products are aluminium (both virgin and
secondary metal), secondary refined copper, lead and primary zinc. Tin
mining in Cornwall supplies about 25 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements
(see p 283) but otherwise British metal smelting and refining industries are
based on imported ores and concentrates except for substantial secondary
production from scrap metal. Britain is also a major producer of the newer
specialised metals including uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear
energy industry, niobium for aircraft production and selenium, silicon,
germanium and tantalum for electronic apparatus. Titanium and titanium
alloys are also produced and used in aircraft production, power generation and
North Sea oil production, where their lightness, resistance to stress, flexibility
and resistance to oxidisation are especially valued. Nearly half the industry is
situated in the Midlands. Other centres include south Wales, London,
Tyneside and Avonmouth, where a zinc smelter of some 100,000 tonnes
capacity operates. Three large-scale aluminium smelters provide 85 per cent of
Britain’s requirements for primary aluminium. The large non-ferrous metals
fabricating industry uses large quantities of imported refined metals such as
copper, lead, zinc and aluminium. A wide range of semi-manufactures is
produced in these metals and their alloys, and, particularly in aluminium,
firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and

drawing; advanced techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure die-castings
are also employed. In recent years considerable progress has been made in the
development of ‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile and elastic than
conventional alloys.
Scientific and technological research for the industry is conducted by the
Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Industry and by the British
Non-Ferrous (BNF) Metals Technology Centre.
The main products exported, including alloys and semi-finished products,
are copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, tin and zinc. Exports of aluminium and
aluminium alloys reached £244 million in 1979 while exports in the same year
of copper, brass and other copper alloys reached £217 million. Exports of
silver, platinum and other metals of the platinum group totalled nearly £397
million in 1979. The major export markets for the whole industry are the
United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The mechanical engineering industry comprises a group of industries manu¬
facturing all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechanical
handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. About half
the industry s production is for the home market. The major customers for
the heavy equipment sectors are the nationalised fuel industries, the
chemical industry and the British Steel Corporation. A wide range of
equipment is supplied to the building and construction industry. Demand
for other types of equipment comes from all the production industries in
Britain.
Britain was the birthplace of the machine tool industry and produces a very
wide range of machine tools. Almost all machine tools produced are purchased
by engineering, vehicles and metal goods industries.
The most important types of metal cutting machine tools are milling,
grinding and turning machines. There is an increasing demand for automatic
control and Britain is an important producer of numerically controlled
machine tools, including machining centres. The largest export markets for
the industry in 1979 were the rest of the European Community, the United
States and Poland. The Machine Tool Trades Association represents most of
the industry and is responsible for the international machine tool exhibition
held in Britain every four years, the next being due in 1984. The Machine Tool
Industry Research Association carries out research into design and perform¬
ance of tools and into production methods, with which the Production
Engineering Research Association is also concerned.

British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including pro¬
cess) plant and steelwork (for nuclear power station construction see Chapter
14). Of particular importance are fabricated products such as pressure vessels,
heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil refining (process) plant,
steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power stations),
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement kilns,
nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and fabricated steelwork
for bridges, buildings and industrial installations. The industrial plant indus¬
try comprises both equipment manufacturers and contractors responsible for
the design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete plants
for process industries. British manufacturers have contributed to major
advances in process technology and British contractors are carrying out major
plant projects in many overseas countries. Gas turbines for industrial applica¬
tion, in particular for power generation in the fuel industries, are another
important section of the industry, where exports have done well in recent
years. Three large firms are pre-eminent in the manufacture of industrial
engines, including those derived from aero-engines. Industrial pumps, valves
and compressors are vital components in many industrial processes, particu¬
larly in the chemicals, oil and electric power industries: over half the produc¬
tion of all types of such equipment is exported. The fluid power industry
makes oil hydraulic and pneumatic equipment for operating machinery and
construction and other equipment. There are many new areas where these
powerful and flexible systems may be used.
Machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and
fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres are produced by the
textile machinery industry in Britain, which is noted for the range, scale and
versatility of its operations. British inventions have remained the foundation
of many textile processes in use internationally and progress has been
made in applying automated techniques (including the use of micro¬
electronics) in the industry. In 1979 75 per cent of the industry’s total
sales were to export markets. Research and development is carried out by
the large firms and the four research associations connected with the textile
industry.
Machinery for food and drink preparation, processing and sterilisation is
another important sector. Refrigerating machinery (excluding domestic
equipment) is used for food and drink processing, but the industry also covers
plant for ships and vehicles and equipment for conserving drinks, food and
ice-cream for the distributive and catering industries.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment,
pile drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of con¬
struction equipment and mining machinery and equipment, including coal
cutting and coal face loading machinery, are substantial. Mechanical handling
equipment is used not only for construction and related activities but through¬
out industry generally. It extends from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems, the main products being cranes and bridge trans¬
porters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and certain special
powered trucks. Electronic control and completely automatic handling
systems are also available.
Britain produces a wide range of equipment for general and special use,
including many special purpose machines such as fruit harvesters and
240
Office
Machinery
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
improved root harvesters (for tractors see p 243). Mechanisation is extensively
used in the arable farming and dairy farming sectors. Much of the new
machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet the needs of
overseas farmers. A large-scale annual exhibition of the industry’s products is
the Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition held in
London in December. The main trade association for the industry is the
Agricultural Engineers Association.
The industry covers a wide range of products including duplicators, photo¬
copiers, typewriters, word processors, microfilm, dictation and mail-room
equipment, and accounting machines and cash registers. A large proportion of
the industry is owned by multi-national companies, and is likely to continue to
be so, as the rapidly advancing technologies involved require a heavy commit¬
ment to research and development. In particular, the incorporation of micro¬
electronics into office products is rapidly increasing. The industry is strong in
microfilm readers/printers, duplicators and office offset litho and rapid high
volume photocopiers.
Other The other major products of the mechanical engineering industry include
Machinery printing, bookbinding and paper goods machinery, space heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning equipment, packaging and bottling machinery, hand
tools, garden tools, portable power tools and miscellaneous non-electrical
machinery, such as boot- and shoe-making machinery, laundry equipment,
automatic vending machines, plastic working machinery and other types of
specialised equipment.

Alongside the firms manufacturing the products of the mechanical engineering
industry are enterprises which supply parts and components and undertake
general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work. Particularly important is
the production of ball, roller, needle and other bearings, about 25 per cent
of which is for the motor vehicle industry, and of other components, such
as industrial fasteners, precision fasteners and chains, gears and drop-
forgings.

Instrument engineering is a particularly important sector of the engineering
industry. Electronic techniques are widely used, particularly in the industrial
instrument sector, which comprises industrial and process measuring and
control instruments and equipment, optical instruments, electrical measuring
and testing instruments, analytical instruments and a diverse group of others.
The chemicals, power, petroleum and iron and steel industries account for
about 80 per cent of process control applications, the largest sector of the
industry and one which is expanding. Major advances have been made in
automatic testing equipment and analytical instruments for medical diagnosis

and pollution control. The industry is served mainly by five trade associa¬
tions—the Scientific Instrument Manufacturers Association, the Control and
Automation Manufacturers Association, the British Industrial Measuring and
Control Apparatus Manufacturers Association, the Electronic Engineering
Association and the British Photographic Manufacturers Association. The
Sira Institute Ltd. conducts research on behalf of the industry and operates an
information service for member firms.
Photographic equipment includes photographic and cinematographic
cameras, projectors and document copying machines. Other sectors of the
instrument industry are concerned with watches, clocks and time recorders
and with surgical instruments and appliances and related products.

The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and installa¬
tion of a wide variety of equipment, including all types of power generation,
transmission and distribution equipment, motors, telecommunications and
broadcasting equipment and domestic electrical appliances. The electronics
industry, which makes a vital contribution to the efficiency of many branches
of the country’s economy, has become one of the most important sectors of
British industry.
Leading representative organisations are the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers’ Association, the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic
Appliances and the Electronic Engineering Association, a member of the
Conference of the Electronics Industry which brings together the six principal
trade associations for the electronics industry. Research is carried out by ERA
Technology Ltd. (formerly the Electrical Research Association).
The main product categories are power equipment (generators, turbines,
motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers) and switchgear, starting and
control gear.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric
power, for telecommunication networks and other purposes; its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials.
Optical fibres (hair-thin strands of pure glass) have been developed, which
have much greater capacity than the copper wiring used in telecommunica¬
tions networks. Four major groups are responsible for more than half the
industry’s output and for a large proportion of the world’s submarine cable
requirements.
A few large firms also dominate the market for other electrical goods,
including domestic appliances. Domestic equipment includes heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, vacuum
242
Electronic
Equipment
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cleaners, irons and electric kettles. Other major sectors are electrical
equipment for motor vehicles and aircraft, electric lamps and light fittings, and
batteries and accumulators.
The British electronics industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive
in the world and British scientists and companies have made important con¬
tributions to electronics technology. Because the applications of electronics
technology are continuing to multiply rapidly, an exact definition of the
industry must be arbitrary, but the sectors included are radar and navigational
aids, telecommunications equipment, security systems, components, con¬
sumer goods, computers and communication and other capital equipment,
as well as electronic process control and industrial instrumentation (see
P 24°)-
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic tech¬
niques is increasing as new switching systems are introduced (see p 323). The
main products are switching and transmission equipment for telephone, telex
and telegraph systems and subscribers’ apparatus such as telephones, private
automatic branch exchanges, teleprinters and facsimile systems. The Post
Office is the main customer in the home market, which is largely supplied by
four companies, and carries out research and development work in co¬
operation with companies.
The components sector manufactures a wide range of both active and
passive electronic components. In addition to a comprehensive indigenous
industry, a number of large United States companies are manufacturing
components in Britain. The sector meets requirements for components in
Britain, and is also very active in international trade. The manufacture of
integrated circuits (in which many components are fabricated within a tiny
chip of semi-conductor material, see also p 213) is an area of particularly rapid
change. Britain is improving its position in the manufacture of advanced
components.
The major consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio equipment. In the audio field, British manufac¬
turers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in the mass
market.^ Equipment is also being manufactured for reception of Britain’s
‘Prestel’ and ‘teletext’ services (see pp 324 and 426).
In the computer sector, an extensive range of computer systems, central
processors and peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale
data processing and scientific work to mini- and micro-computers for use in
control and automation systems and for home and office use, are produced.
Essential to the sector is the ‘software’ industry, in which Britain is especially
strong, which produces programs and associated services and complements the
hardware industry, enabling the systems manufacturers to provide complete
solutions to meet the requirements of users.
An expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufacture
of radio communication equipment, radar and radio navigational aids for
ships and aircraft, alarms and signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. British equipment is used extensively
overseas, for defence, civil aviation, shipping, health, educational and other
purposes.
An important advance in medical diagnosis has been the computerised
tomography X-ray scanner, which was developed in Britain. This has made a
world-wide impact by providing images of sections of brain or whole body on
living subjects.

The motor vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial
vehicles, caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by four large groups: BL Ltd., in which
there is a majority public shareholding. Ford, Vauxhall and Talbot (formerly
Chrysler UK), which account for over 99 per cent of car production and some
97 per cent of commercial vehicle output; the remainder i& in the hands of
smaller, specialist producers of cars, heavy commercial vehicles, buses and
coaches. There has traditionally been a substantial positive balance of trade in
the industry, though in 1979 surpluses of £239 million on commercial vehicles
and £684 million on parts and accessories were offset by a deficit of £1,757
million on cars.
The principal trade association for the industry is the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders which holds a biennial motor industry show at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham.
Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of wheeled tractors produced;
Britain is the third largest producer of four-wheeled agricultural tractors in the
world and a leading exporter. Production is dominated by three large firms,
with two others responsible for most of the remainder.
Though in recent years the motor cycle industry has contracted and the
domestic market is largely supplied by imports, the market for pedal cycles has
doubled in the last decade and is mainly supplied by British firms. TI Raleigh
is the largest maker and exporter of bicycles in the world.
British Rail’s requirements of locomotives and rolling stock are largely met by
its own workshops; it also supplies equipment and provides consultancy
services to many overseas countries. There is also a large private sector, which
builds trains for London Transport and rapid-transit networks, as well as
railway equipment for home and export markets (including components,
traction and control gear, signalling, heating and ventilation systems and track
equipment), undertakes electrification and other major works overseas and
provides overseas consultancy services.
Britain’s aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in
Western Europe and the Western world. The products of the industry include
civil and military aircraft, helicopters, aero-engines, guided weapons, hover¬
craft and space vehicles, supported by a comprehensive range of aircraft and
airfield equipment and systems.
British Aerospace (BAe), a public corporation, and the publicly-owned
companies Short Brothers and Rolls-Royce are responsible for the greater part
of aircraft, guided weapon and aero-engine manufacture in Britain. BAe, in
244
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker
Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation were vested in 1977, is the largest
British aircraft and guided weapons manufacturer. The British Aerospace Act
1980 provides for the whole of BAe’s business to be vested in a successor
company to be called British Aerospace Limited and the Government intends
that shares in the company should subsequently be offered for sale, subject to a
limitation on the proportion of foreign ownership. Rolls-Royce is responsible
for almost the entire output of aero-engines in Britain; it is one of the world’s
three leading aero-engine manufacturers and over 10,000 of the world’s civil
and military aircraft are powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
The private sector is composed of a number of aircraft companies, including
Westland Aircraft and its subsidiary, Westland Helicopters (which specialises
in helicopter design and manufacture and, in addition, performs a wide range
of aviation equipment work) and all of the aviation equipment sector.
Production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the HS748 feederliner and
the HS125 business jet, while the new BAe 146 feederjet and Jetstream 31
transport aircraft are expected to be in service by 1982. BAe is a full partner in
the European consortium Airbus Industrie; it is continuing to manufacture the
wings for the A300 Airbus and is designing and manufacturing the wings for
the A310 derivative. Military aircraft include the unique Harrier vertical/short
take-off and landing aircraft (which has achieved substantial sales to the
United States), the Hawk advanced trainer, the Anglo-French Jaguar tactical
fighter/operational trainer and the Tornado multi-role combat aircraft, which
is a collaborative venture by Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and
Italy.
BAe is also a major producer of guided weapons including a number which
have been sold overseas, in particular the Rapier ground-to-air missile. Col¬
laborative guided weapon projects between Britain and its NATO partners are
becoming increasingly important.
Short Brothers, which is based in Belfast, produces the Skyvan, the SD 330
commuter airliner, airframe components and missiles. Westland Helicopters
manufacture the successful Sea King and are the British partners in the
Anglo-French collaborative programmes on the Puma Gazelle and Lynx
helicopters, which are being produced for the armed forces of a number of
countries besides Britain and France.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the collaboratively-
produced RB199 for the Tornado, the RB211 civil engine and its more
powerful derivative the RB211-524, the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for
the Harrier and the Gem helicopter engine. More advanced versions of the
RB211-524 are under development, as is another RB211 derivative,
RB211—535, which will be the launch engine for the new Boeing 757 airliner.
Industrial versions of aero-engines such as the RB211 and the Olympus
(developed for Concorde) are being produced for use in oil and gas transmis¬
sion and as stand-by power generators. Versions for marine use, in particular of
the Olympus and the Tyne, are being used to power a new generation of
warships for the Royal Navy and many overseas navies.
The aviation equipment manufacturers provide a wide range of systems
essential to the design of engines and aircraft, including engine and flight
controls, electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin
furnishings and flight deck information displays, which are sold both in
domestic and overseas markets. They also supply equipment for ground
operation including that needed for radar and air traffic control, ground power
suppliers and flight simulators, to airports and airlines throughout the world.
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES

The space sector’s main effort is directed towards the programmes of the
European Space Agency (ESA, see p 396), although sales of sub-systems are
made world-wide. The Ariel VI satellite, still in operation (see p 396) was
built for the Science Research Council. Through the ESA, BAe’s Dynamics
Group has acted as prime contractor for the OTS experimental communica¬
tions satellite and the GEOS scientific satellites. Manufacture of the
operational European Communications Satellites (ECS) for the European
telecommunications satellite organisation EUTELSAT, and the maritime
satellites (MARECS) expected to be used operationally by the International
Maritime Satellite Organisation (INMARSAT) is in hand. Ground stations
have been constructed for the Post Office (see p 324).
The industry is thus extensively involved in the manufacture of space
systems and in scientific research in other European collaborative programm¬
es. It carries out an extensive programme of research and development on
airframes, aero-engines and equipment, including avionics, while considerable
research is also undertaken by universities and Government research estab¬
lishments.
Aerospace production and exports, which are fairly evenly divided between
aircraft, engines and equipment (including avionics), have made considerable
progress over the past few years and now stand at record levels. The principal
destinations for exports are the United States and countries with which Britain
is involved in collaborative ventures such as France and the Federal Republic
of Germany.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aero¬
space Companies which organises a major international air show at Farn-
borough, Hampshire, every two years. Major suppliers of avionics equipment
are also members of the Electronic Engineering Association.
Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding and accounts for about
4-8 per cent of world output of merchant shipping. Naval shipbuilding and the
construction of vessels and structures connected with offshore oil production
are important sectors of the industry. In merchant shipbuilding the SD14
general cargo series has been especially successful. Programmes of modernisa¬
tion and reorganisation have taken place in most of the major shipyards,
including the construction of several covered-berth ship ‘factories’. British
yards include some which are among the most modern and efficient in the
world. Employment in the industry continues to contract, however, as a result
of an over-capacity in world shipping.
Nineteen of the principal shipbuilding companies, five companies manufac¬
turing slow-speed marine diesel engines and three training companies and their
subsidiaries were taken into public ownership in 1977 under a public corpora¬
tion, British Shipbuilders. Also in public ownership is the Belfast firm,
Harland and Wolff, which is administered by the Northern Ireland Depart¬
ment of Commerce. The public sector accounts for 98 per cent of output in
merchant shipbuilding, for all slow-speed marine diesel engines and for some
50 per cent of turnover in ship-repairing. The public sector also includes a
number of companies engaged in general engineering work connected with the
marine industries.
Following a review in 1979 of the prospects for the merchant shipbuilding
activities of British Shipbuilders it was concluded that, given the world ship¬
building recession and the need for the corporation to achieve viability, further
contraction within the industry would be inevitable.
A number of yards in the private sector build smaller vessels, including
246
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
patrol boats, fishing and harbour craft, supply vessels, tugs, cargo ships, small
tankers, ferries, pleasure boats and yachts.
About 35 per cent of the output of British yards is exported. Most private
sector companies in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries are rep¬
resented by the Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Independent Association.
Research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken by the
British Ship Research Association.

A range of metal products other than those described in previous sections is
produced by a group of industries made up of a very large number of firms.
One of the main groups, in which small firms predominate, manufactures
engineers’ small tools and gauges, which include jigs and fixtures, press tools
and moulds, hard metal-tipped tools and other metal cutting tools. Another
group manufactures cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and
blades). Although there are many small firms in the industry, seven relatively
large concerns are responsible for over half of output.
A wide variety of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets and
dustbins, made mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, are produced
by the hollow-ware industry, together with industrial hollow-ware, such
as kegs, drums and barrels. The manufacture of hand tools, including
files, saws, hammers, axes and spades, is a long-established industry.
About half of its total production is for export. Jewellery, gold and silver¬
ware and the refining of precious metals is an industry in which British
craftsmen are world famous; there are many small craft firms in all sectors,
but five relatively large companies provide about 60 per cent of manufac¬
turing capacity. The Royal Mint makes coins for some 70 overseas countries.
Other main groups of metal goods are bolts, nuts, and screws, cans and metal
boxes, metal furniture, metal windows, metallic closures, metal small-ware
such as needles and pins, safes, locks and keys, domestic gas appliances and
drop forgings.

MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES 247
The chemicals industry is one of the most successful industries in Britain as
well as being its third largest industrial sector, accounting for about 10 per cent
of net manufacturing output. The industry is also the second largest in Europe
and its exports of £5,212 million in 1979 (accounting for 16 per cent of British
manufacturing exports) placed Britain among the top five chemical exporting
nations. The industry is undertaking a considerable investment programme,
despite continuing uncertainties over the price and availability of raw
materials. The largest British chemicals group, Imperial Chemical Industries,
is the fifth largest chemicals company in the world, accounting for some 25 per
cent of production in Britain. A further 40 per cent is in the hands of 20 other
large- and medium-sized companies. The industry is represented by the
Chemical Industries Association. Research and development work is financed
by the companies themselves. Western Europe is the major export market.
About a quarter of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric acid
and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for industry.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture of
fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass, metals and other products.
Organic chemicals include the heavy organics produced in bulk and the
speciality intermediate products. About three-quarters of the output of organic
chemicals is made up of petroleum-based chemicals. The most important
products (by weight) are ethylene, propylene and benzene. The main uses of
organic chemicals are in solvents, plastics and synthetic resins, synthetic
rubber, man-made fibres and detergents, and as intermediate chemicals in the
manufacture of many other products.
Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general chemi¬
cals formulated for specific uses. Radioisotopes are produced by The
Radiochemical Centre Ltd.; over half the centre’s production is for export.
Britain, whose scientists have discovered and developed many basic medicines
and drugs, produces a complete range of pharmaceutical preparations. These
include antibiotics, sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine pro¬
ducts, anaesthetics, vaccine sera and naturally occurring drugs. Manufacturers
in Britain are among the world’s leading producers and exporters of prep¬
arations for the treatment of human and animal diseases. This sector is one of
the major growth areas of the chemical industry.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture has been a fast growing section of industry and
one third of total production is exported. Expansion in recent years has mainly
been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are polyethylene
(used on coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride
(known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial purposes and consumer
goods), polystyrene (a material used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods) and polypropylene (which can be fabricated as mouldings,
films and fibres). A new group of plastics materials reinforced with carbon
fibres is also in commercial production in Britain; they have up to three times
the strength but are only 20 per cent of the weight of steel, and are being
increasingly used in, for example, vehicle manufacture. Styrene-butadiene
and polybutadiene rubbers used for tyres, high styrene rubbers for shoe soles
and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is required, are
also in large-scale production, together with neoprene rubber.

The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, with a number of
firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—nit¬
rogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the domestic
market. The use of ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and urea is
resulting in more concentrated fertilisers. Notable discoveries and develop¬
ments by the British crop protection industry include the insecticidal property
of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective hormone weed-killer,
MCPA, Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide, and Milstem, an organic
fungicide which acts against mildew in various food crops. Herbicides are the
largest category of sales of pesticides and allied products.
Britain is a major producer of paints, varnishes and allied products. In recent
years many improved techniques have been introduced into the paint and
varnish industry, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments,
powder coatings, non-drip, quick-drying paints and paints needing only one
application.
These industries include besides soap, detergents and toilet preparations,
cosmetics and perfumes. Many of the firms in the toiletries industry are owned
or financed by United States companies but there are a number of long-
established British cosmetics, toiletries and soap manufacturers. Both sectors
are significant exporters.
There is a varied group of chemical products which account for about 10 per
cent of the industry’s net output. It includes formulated adhesives, printing
ink, colours and dyestuffs, photographic chemical materials and floor and
furniture polishes.
Refined mineral oil (see also p 267) is the largest product in this sector,
together with medicinal paraffin, paraffin wax, petroleum jelly and other
manufactures. Production of coke, other manufactured solid fuels, lubricating
oils and greases is also included.

Although Britain is a net importer of foodstuffs, it is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers of food and drink products. The industry is one of the most
important sectors in the economy, employing over 600,000 people and earning
about £20,830 million in 1979. Exports in the same year totalled about £2,044
million.

MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES 249
About two-thirds of the bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process (the ‘Chorleywood’ process) developed
by the industry’s principal research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking
Research Association, and now widely used in other countries. Two groups are
predominant; Allied Bakeries and Rank Hovis McDougall. In smaller bakeries
production of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually allied to bread
production. Biscuits and related products are a major sector of the industry and
have gained a world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain milling and the
production of various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small firms.
The three main manufacturers are Rowntree Mackintosh, Cadbury Schwep¬
pes and Mars. A substantial proportion of total world exports of chocolate and
sugar confectionery are supplied by Britain.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and preserv¬
ing of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the preparation
of extracts and pastes. In addition to the output of quick-frozen fish, small
quantities are also canned.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and
vegetables, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces. Other products of the food
processing industry include sugar, sugar preparations and honey, dairy pro¬
ducts and eggs, vegetable and animal oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and spices
and cereal preparations.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and
in the food and drink industry as a whole, is whisky. Scotch whisky accounts
for almost all whisky production in Britain. About four-fifths of annual sales
are to overseas buyers; the United States imports nearly a third of the distilled
alcoholic beverages exported from Britain. The rest of the European Com¬
munity and Japan are the other largest markets. Production of gin in Britain
has risen steadily since the early 1950s. One company accounts for a large
proportion of output. Some of the larger manufacturers also own distilleries
abroad.
In the brewing and malting industry there are seven major brewery groups
whose products are sold nationally, and about 80 smaller enterprises who
mainly supply locally, or regionally, many of them because of a demand for
traditionally brewed beers. Firms have introduced new production methods,
including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch production
plants are well established. The main raw materials used are malt, hops and
some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from home-grown
barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. In recent years the popularity
of lager has increased considerably.
Three major groups account for much of the cider and perry produced in
Britain. The industry is based mainly in Devon, Somerset and Hereford and
Worcester. Imported grape and fruit juices are used in the production of most
of the made wine. A much smaller, though expanding viticultural industry
produces wine from grapes grown in vineyards, mostly in southern England.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There
are some very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are
marketed on a national scale, while other firms supply regional markets. There

is some specialisation among firms in the production of various types, such as
carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and
‘mixers’, fruit juices and health drinks.
The British tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and
tobacco goods sold in Britain. It is made up of four major companies and a
number of smaller ones, and specialises in the production of high-quality
cigarettes made from flue-cured tobacco. Exports, mainly of cigarettes, are
shipped to many overseas countries including Belgium, Saudi Arabia and the
Netherlands. Britain imports raw tobacco in large amounts from the United
States, India and Canada.

The historical branches of the industry, based on the natural fibres of cotton
and wool, linen and jute, have retained their separate identities but the
boundaries between them are becoming blurred with the increasing use of
man-made fibres. The growth of man-made fibres has stimulated the
development of new processes and new types of yarn and cloth and has strongly
influenced the structure of the industry. A small number of large multi-fibre,
multi-process groups have emerged, although in many sectors there is still a
preponderance of small firms engaged in just one or two operations.
British textile firms manufacture a wide variety of goods, including lace,
narrow fabrics and household textiles, such as blankets, sheets, towels, and
tablecloths. Rope, twine, nets and netting are manufactured by the cordage
industry, which is one of the largest in Europe. A recent development is the
production of non-woven fabric by the melded process, which dispenses with
the conventional weaving and knitting stages.
Research for the industry is provided by the Shirley Institute (cotton, silk,
and man-made fibres), the Lambeg Industrial Research Association, WIRA
(formerly the Wool Industries Research Association) and HATRA (formerly
the Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association). The Department of
Industry sponsors research and development both for these research associa¬
tions and also directly within the industry.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain and
continuing extensive research has produced a wide variety of types with their
own special characteristics. The two main types are still those first
developed—the cellulosic fibres, such as rayon, and the synthetic fibres, such
as nylon and polyester, made wholly by chemical processes. Acrylic fibres,
including Courtelle (a British discovery), Acrilan and Orion are important
products, as are the elastomeric or spandex fibres which have inherent
properties of stretch and recovery, anti-static synthetic yarns embedded with

carbon and various fire-resistant yarns. More recently there has been a greater
use of the polyolefins (polypropylene and polyethylene) in the carpet and
carpet backing and packaging fields and still more recently in household
textiles and clothing. Output in the man-made fibre industry is concentrated in
the hands of a few large firms.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary extensive reorgan¬
isation, modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Production
includes single and double cotton yarn, spun man-made fibre and mixture
cloth. The largest markets for cotton fabrics in 1978 were the rest of the
European Community, the United States, Finland, Togo, South Africa, Zaire
and Australia.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The wool textile industry, the export sales of which are usually double the
value of imports, is one of the largest in the world and includes the world’s
biggest wool textile company, Illingworth, Morris. There are two main
branches, woollen and worsted. An increasing amount of man-made fibre is
now blended with wool. West Yorkshire is the main producing area but
Scotland and the west of England are also famous as specialised producers of
high quality yarn and cloth. Large quantities of raw wool are scoured and
cleaned in Britain to prepare it for spinning. Britain is also a growing exporter
of raw wool. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are Japan, the
United States and the rest of the European Community.
Some 75 per cent of the output of the carpet and rug industry is made up of
tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually with a high
man-made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Woven carpets,
such as Axminster and Wilton, account for most of the remainder of sales.
There is a higher wool content in woven types, although they too are making
more use of man-made fibres. The high quality and variety of design make
Britain the world’s leading producer of woven carpets.
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and the man¬
made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets, cordage
and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the
packaging, upholstery, building and motor car industries. New uses for jute,
for example, as a plastics reinforcement and for decorative wall coverings, are
also being considered.
The hosiery and knitwear industry comprises more than 1,000 firms, situated
mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland, of which most are small to medium
in size. The industry produces fabrics, outerwear, underwear, tights, socks,
stockings, gloves and accessories.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe; it is highly labour
intensive and dominated by small firms, with about 6,000 firms, accounting
252 BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for only 4 per cent of Britain’s total employment in manufacturing. The
negotiation of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (see p 372) has encouraged investment and exports have
risen somewhat since 1977, although import penetration has continued to
increase. The Clothing Export Council, which represents a major part of the
industry, co-ordinates its promotional activities.
Footwear The British footwear industry is largely made up of small firms. After being
severely affected by the recession and by increasing imports, the industry has
more than half of the domestic market.
Leather Leather tanning and leather goods manufacturing is another long-established
industry in Britain. All types of leather (including heavy types for industrial
use) and leather goods are produced. Collective research is carried out by the
British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association.

Goods
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products, including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manufac¬
ture is now based on highly mechanised systems. One company, the London
Brick Company, supplies about 40 per cent of total brick deliveries. Refractory
goods include firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite
bricks and alumina bricks.
Cement The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of
continuous technical improvement and intensive research. One new variation,
glass-reinforced cement composites, consists of ordinary Portland cement and
sand combined with an alkali-resistant glass fibre. The capacity of the industry
as a whole has been substantially expanded in recent years.
Pottery rpiie pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all
home needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay
from Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the
industry; kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced all the coal-fired kilns,
and new decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic machinery,
such as automatic glazing machines, have been introduced. Domestic pottery,
including china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for two-thirds of the
industry’s output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and
electrical ware, and such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stone¬
ware, porous ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production of tableware is
concentrated in two major groups. Britain is the world’s principal manufac-

turer of fine bone china, much of which is exported; famous makes include
Wedgwood, Spade, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton, Aynsley, Coalport
and Royal Crown Derby.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the biggest in the world. Glass containers form
the largest part of the industry; another major section is devoted to the
manufacture of flat glass in its various forms, chiefly ‘float’ glass, a process
developed in Britain and licensed to glassmakers throughout the world. The
use of glass for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls
has greatly increased in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are
produced for the motor and other industries. Other products include tubular
glass, mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass
fibres, and all types of glass containers (mostly made automatically). A tra¬
ditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department of
Ceramics, Glasses and Polymers of Sheffield University.

The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. The
larger British groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and
paper producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the Com¬
monwealth and Europe. In recent years paper production has concentrated on
printing and writing papers and boards and speciality grades. There has also
been a significant trend towards waste-based packaging grades, in order to
reduce the industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. Domestically
produced woodpulp represents only a small percentage of raw material sup¬
plies but the use of recycled waste paper is increasing; together they currently
provide nearly 60 per cent of the industry’s needs. The main types of paper and
board produced are printing and writing papers and board, packaging board,
household tissues and industrial and special purpose papers.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of converted
products, including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging and busi¬
ness stationery products.
The printing and publishing industries produce a wide range of products,
including national and provincial newspapers, periodicals, books, business
stationery and greeting cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large
groups in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sectors, but general
printing, engraving, bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essen¬
tially industries of small firms. Production processes include high-speed print¬
ing equipment, including electronic engraving, advanced processes of photo¬
graphic reproduction and computer typesetting. Security printers (of, for
example, banknotes and postage stamps) have a high reputation and are
important exporters.
The most important overseas markets for printed matter are the United
States, the Irish Republic and Australia.

Rubber Tyres and tubes represent nearly half the output of the industry, but firms
make a variety of other goods, the most important being vehicle components
and accessories, conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and
rubber footwear, gloves and clothing. Rubber is also used for inflatable life-
rafts, containers for fuel and other industrial liquids and seals for storage tanks
and other products where there are problems of air exclusion and vapour
suppression. One of the largest tyre groups in Europe, Dunlop-Pirelli Union,
was formed in 1971 between Britain’s leading rubber and tyre company and its
Italian equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United
States and other overseas companies. The industry’s consumption of rubber
includes natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
Furniture, Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
Brushes and office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms predominating. In
Timber recent years the industry has experienced an increase in demand from overseas.
Exports have risen from £69 million in 1975 to £231 million in 1979. The
industry comprises wooden, metal and plastic furniture, upholstery, bedding
and soft furnishings. A Development Council for the industry has existed since
1949. Scientific research and technical and other information services are
provided by the Furniture Industry Research Association.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units.
Domestic production of timber has been steadily increasing but the timber
industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large proportion of
timber sales are dependent on the construction industry. Chipboard is the
fastest growing sector of the industry; other important sectors are hardwood
and plywood.
Plastics In addition to the plastics components and accessories supplied to many
Products different industries, the plastics products industry manufactures a wide range
of building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks
and other products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle,
furniture and other industries; rigid foams; packaging products, including
bottles, containers and bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware; many kinds
of household goods; vinyl and other floorcoverings; and leathercloth.
Toys, Games

Equipment
The industry manufactures toys, games, sports equipment and children’s
carriages. There are about 600 toy and games makers in Britain but some 20
companies dominate the market. The greatest expansion has been in the field
of craft and hobby kits, but electronic toys and games are becoming increas¬
ingly important. British diecast toys and model construction kits are well
known overseas; more than a third of the output of toys and games is for
export. France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are

the major markets for toys while the United States and the European Com¬
munity are the main markets for sports equipment.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounted for about 6 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1979, includes firms engaged on the design, construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore
structures, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, and struc¬
tural work connected with thermal and hydroelectric power stations and
telecommunications. About 1-3 million people are employed in construction,
accounting for nearly 6 per cent of total employment. There are also about
385,000 self-employed. About 19 per cent of construction workers are
employed by public authorities. In 1979 repair and maintenance accounted for
36 per cent of the value of construction output in Great Britain.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1979 about 89 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were about 63,000 firms
employing two or more people 93 per cent of them employed fewer than 25.
Public authorities as a whole employed about 220,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these were engaged on repair and maintenance work for
local authorities.
Some 46 per cent of operatives were occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £6,762 million annually. The total labour force includes about
68,000 trainees, training under the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. The
normal apprenticeship period is three years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake
responsibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either
by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency (PSA), which is an integral part of the
Department of the Environment (see p 45), is responsible for the construc¬
tion programmes undertaken directly by the Government, including work for
the armed forces both in Britain and overseas. In 1978-79 the PSA spent £577
million on design and construction. The Department of the Environment is
responsible for the sponsorship of the construction industry. Among other
things, this involves both formal and informal consultation with the industry.
The Department is also responsible for co-ordinating research and develop¬
ment in construction throughout Government and seeks to influence tech¬
niques and methods within the industry.
The value of the work done in Britain in 1979 amounted to £18,866 million of
which £4,505 million represented new housing and £7,599 million other new
work; repair and maintenance accounted for the remaining £6,762 million.
Housing
During 1979 a total of 220,900 dwellings were started in Great Britain. Starts
in the public sector were 80,300 and those for private owners 140,600. In the

course of the same year 235,600 dwellings were completed, of which 101,200
were in the public sector and 134,500 in the private sector. Industrialised
building methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the
work in both sectors.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environ¬
ment and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the
adoption of advanced methods of building, and to provide technical advice and
services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
The Association of Building Centres represents the interests of the 12
building centres throughout Britain most of which provide both a comprehen¬
sive permanent exhibition and information services on building materials and
products, building services and techniques.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1980 were nuclear
power stations (see p 277), hospitals, large-scale housing developments, and
roads, tunnels and bridges, including the new bridge being built across the
river Humber (see p 303), and the Thames Barrier which will form part of
London’s flood defences.
Total overseas earnings of all sectors of the construction industry in 1978-79
were estimated at about £2,700 million, some £130 million more than in the
previous 12 months. British contractors earned £345 million from overseas
customers and a further £65 million from overseas branches and subsidiaries.
The related professions (consulting engineers, architects and surveyors) had
earnings of £460 million, while exports of building materials, plant and
machinery accounted for some £1,900 million.
In 1978-79 British construction firms carried out work overseas valued at
£1,667 million, an increase of £80 million over the previous year. New con¬
tracts worth £1,299 million were won overseas in 1978-79.
The Government and the construction industry are represented on the
Exports Standing Committee of the National Consultative Council for the
Building and Civil Engineering Industries.
Within the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Estab¬
lishment (BRE) is concerned with all aspects of construction research. In
addition, the Building Research Advisory Service of the BRE provides techni¬
cal advice over a wide range of construction problems. An Agrement Board
tests and certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations, while the major construction firms have research departments
working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with
research include the universities and colleges of technology. The larger pro¬
ducers of primary building materials do some research into production
methods and new developments.
SERVICE INDUSTRIES
There has been a steady rise in the proportion of employees in Britain working
in the service industries and in June 1979 about 58-3 per cent of employees
(13 million people) were engaged in this sector, compared with 50-8 per
cent in 1969. The contribution of the various groups to gross domestic
product can be seen in Table 7, p 204. The main areas of growth have been
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
257
concentrated in the financial, professional and scientific services, hotels
and catering, and the miscellaneous services sector, while employment in the
distributive trades has changed little and in transport and communications it
has declined.
In Great Britain there were about 2-7 million employees in the distributive
trades in 1979, together with a large number of owners of businesses. The
distributive trades accounted for about 10 per cent of Britain’s national income
in 1978, retailing contributing a little more than wholesaling. Closely con¬
nected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service directly to the
public, such as the hotel and catering trades, garage and motor repair trades,
laundries and dry cleaners, hairdressers and shoe repairers. Among the other
services described elsewhere are education (see Chapter 7), national and local
government services (see Chapter 2), transport and communications (see
Chapter 16), services provided by financial institutions (see Chapter 18) and
research and development services (see Chapter 20).
RETAIL TRADES Turnover of the retail trades has been growing gradually in real terms for many
years. In 1979 retail sales were 44 per cent higher than in 1976, representing,
however, only a 2 per cent increase in volume. In 1978 there were an estimated
235>000 businesses in the retail trade in Great Britain with a turnover of more
than ^10,000 (see Table 15); they had 350,000 outlets, of which about 59 per
cent were accounted for by single-outlet retailers. Their turnover was nearly
£45,ooo million in 1978 when they invested £1,093 million. Over 2-4 million
people (including a large number of part-time staff) were engaged in retailing
in 1978. As the large multiple retailers (those with ten or more outlets) have
grown in size and diversified their product ranges there has been a decline in
the number of retail businesses and outlets, particularly of the small indepen¬
dent businesses.
The largest multiple retailers in the packaged grocery market are the retail
co-operatives, followed by Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Fine Fare, Kwiksave and
International Stores. Retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations
controlled by their members, membership being open to anyone paying a small
deposit on a minimum share; at the end of 1979 the 216 retail societies had 10-4
million members and 9,800 retail outlets. Turnover in 1979 amounted to
£3>400 million, 6-7 per cent of total retail trade. Retail co-operatives and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society (see p 260) are members of the Co-operative
Union as are a number of other co-operative bodies such as the Co-operative
Bank. Tesco has some 530 stores and sales in 1979-80 were valued at some
£1,602 million. Sainsbury has more than 200 outlets and the company’s sales
amounted to £1,227 million in 1979-80.
The leading specialist multiple stores are Marks and Spencer (with sales of
£1,543 million in 1979-80), Boots, F. W. Woolworth, W. H. Smith and
British Home Stores.
Department stores, which sell a very wide range of goods, account for about
5 per cent of retail turnover. The six largest groups are responsible for about 85
per cent of turnover with three of the groups, House of Fraser, Debenham and
the John Lewis partnership, accounting for some 29, 19 and 14 per cent
respectively.
There are a number of discount stores operating on the principle of
selling most or all of their goods at a reduced price. Electrical goods, furniture,
carpets and do-it-yourself supplies are some of the main items sold by discount
stores.
Mail order is accounting for a growing proportion of retail sales and about 16

a Figures cover businesses above the threshold of value-added tax (£10,000 at that time). It is
thought that in 1978 there were a further 20,000-25,000 retail businesses with turnover of between
£5,000 and £10,000, and aggregate turnover of about 0-5 per cent of retail turnover.
Discrepancies between totals and the sums of their constituent parts are due to rounding.
million people regularly shop by post. In 1978 mail order sales totalled some
£2,100 million, representing 5 per cent of retail sales and 8-7 per cent of retail
sales excluding food shops. The leading items sold by mail order are clothing,
footwear, furniture and floor coverings.
One of the most significant trends in retailing in recent years has been the
increase in the proportion of turnover accounted for by large multiple retailers;
they have 54 per cent of retail turnover. Other important trends have been the
increase in very large self-service stores selling a wide variety of products,
diversification by food multiples into selling a wider range of goods, the
development of specially-designed shopping precincts and an even stronger
emphasis on price competition.
There are supermarkets in most towns and cities in Britain. The main multiple
grocery companies have been steadily increasing the size of their supermarkets
and closing the smaller and less efficient ones. The trend to greater size has led
to a growing number of superstores and hypermarkets, single-level, self-
service stores offering a wider range of food and non-food merchandise and
which have at least 2,500 square metres (26,900 square feet) and 5,000 square
metres (53,800 square feet) respectively of selling space. They are designed
primarily for shoppers with cars and substantial free car-parking space is
usually provided. In Britain the first such store was opened in the mid-1960s
and by March 1980 there were some 140 superstores and 36 hypermarkets,
with a combined selling space of 682,500 square metres (7‘3 million square
feet), while planning permission for a further 71 superstores and 10 hypermar-

kets, with a combined selling space of 302,100 square metres (3-3 million
square feet), had been granted. It is Government policy that these stores
should be located within urban areas, preferably within shopping centres,
where they are accessible to all shoppers including those without cars.
Britain has a variety of new purpose-built shopping centres. Among the largest
are those at Brent Cross in London, the Victoria Centre in Nottingham and the
Eldon Square development in Newcastle upon Tyne, while the centre in
Milton Keynes (Buckinghamshire) is one of the largest in Europe.
Many of the large multiple groups have diversified over the last few years to
offer a much bigger range of goods than previously. This has been especially
noticeable for the large food retailers, which often sell non-food products, such
as beer, wines and spirits, clothing and household appliances, as well as
packaged groceries. Another trend is that many superstores and large super¬
markets offer fresh as well as packaged food, often with special counters or
areas for fresh meat, fish, vegetables and bread baked on the premises.
Retailers are placing greater emphasis on price competition as a means of
promoting sales, while trading stamps, which were an important method of
sales promotion in the late 1960s and early 1970s, have become much less
significant. With the growth of payments by credit card, many of the large
retailers have issued their own credit cards for regular customers to use in
their branches in an attempt to increase sales, particularly of high-value
goods.
Numerous improvements to speed up the flow of customers through super¬
market check-outs include conveyor belts for goods being handled beside the
tills, change-giving machines and special check-outs for customers with a small
number of purchases. Store lay-outs have been improved, with wider aisles
allowing more room for shoppers and their trolleys. Laser-scanning electronic
check-outs are expected to have a major impact on retailing in the next few
years. Under this system, the package of each item is marked with a special
bar-code which is read by a low-power laser beam at the point of sale and the
price is automatically retrieved from a central computer. The customer is given
a receipt showing the price and identity of each item purchased, while the store’s
stock records are altered automatically. Substantial savings are expected from
improved stock control and a reduction of individual price marking in stores.
Key Markets introduced the first operational laser-scanning electronic check¬
out in Britain at Spalding (Lincolnshire) in 1979. Further systems were
introduced early in 1980 by Sainsbury at Broadfield, near Crawley (West
Sussex), and by International Stores at Folkestone (Kent).
In 1974 (when the most recent wholesaling census was conducted) there were
some 80,000 businesses engaged in wholesaling and dealing. Turnover
(including sales to other wholesalers and dealers) amounted to £49,800 million
and just over 1 million people were employed in this sector. The main areas in
which wholesalers are dominant are groceries and provisions, petroleum pro¬
ducts and ores and metals. A number of the large retailers carry out the
functions of the wholesaler by having their own warehouses, and buying and
distributive organisations.
Two large groups, Booker McConnell and Linfood, predominate in the
wholesale food trade. London’s wholesale markets play a significant part in the

distribution of foodstuffs. Covent Garden is the main market for fruit and
vegetables, Smithfield for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has its own wholesale organisa¬
tion, the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), to serve the needs of retail
societies; its turnover was £1,659 million in 1979. Retail societies are encour¬
aged to buy from the CWS, which supplies about two-thirds of their require¬
ments.
‘Cash and carry’ wholesaling is becoming increasingly important. By bulk
purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises and credit and delivery
facilities, these wholesalers can offer large discounts to their customers. There
were some 650 ‘cash and carry’ depots in Britain in 1979; total sales by the cash
and carry members of the National Federation of Wholesale Grocers and
Provision Merchants were estimated at about £1,625 million.
In the grocery trade there are a number of voluntary groups which have been
formed by wholesalers with small retailers, whereby the retailers are encour¬
aged by discounts and other incentives to buy as much as possible from the
wholesaler. This has helped to preserve the existence of retail outlets for the
wholesaler, and also the traditional ‘corner shops’ and village stores, of value to
local communities, and has given small retailers the advantages of bulk buying
and co-ordinated distribution.
Among the other services provided directly to the public, some of the financial
services, notably building societies, have been increasing the number of
branches in the High Street as their activities have expanded (see p 364).
Business services which have been developing more rapidly in recent years
include advertising, market research, public relations, consultancy, confer¬
ence centres and employment agencies. Advertising expenditure rose by 16 per
cent in 1979 to £2,129 million, according to the Advertising Association, of
which advertising in the press accounted for 70 per cent, advertising on
television for 22 per cent and advertising on commercial radio for 2-4 per cent.
Advertising campaigns are planned mainly by advertising agencies (of which
there are several hundred in Britain) and, in some cases, the agencies also
provide marketing, consumer research and other services. Sales by the 28
member companies of the Association of Market Survey Organisations
amounted to more than £50 million in 1979, when the total of market research
commissioned was estimated at £85 million. There are a number of major
conference and/or exhibition centres including the National Exhibition Centre
at Birmingham, the Wembley Conference Centre in London, and the Brighton
Centre. Conference centres under construction include an £83 million centre
at the Barbican in London and a new centre at Harrogate (North Yorkshire).
The travel business is another growth sector, and some 2,000 travel agents
with about 4,500 offices (about 90 per cent of the total) belong to the Associa¬
tion of British Travel Agents. Many travel agents are small businesses, but
there are a few large firms (of which the biggest is Thomas Cook) with many
High Street branches. A growing number of people are engaged in the profes¬
sions; these include solicitors (of whom there are about 41,000 in practice in
Britain) and estate agents (of whom there are an estimated 25,000 in Britain).
In June 1978 about 895,000 people were employed in the hotel and catering
trades in Britain: 286,000 in hotels and other residential establishments;
173,ooo in restaurants, cafes and snack bars; 256,000 in public houses;
109,000 in clubs; and 71,000 by catering contractors. A large number of
self-employed people are also engaged in hotels and catering. There were about
1:2,500 licensed hotels in Great Britain in 1977 with a total turnover of £1,600
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
261
million. Hotels are concentrated in the main business centres, notably
London, and in seaside and other holiday resorts. Many licensed hotels as well
as most of the numerous guest houses are small, with fewer than 20 rooms,
although there are also several large groups of hotels. The biggest is
Trusthouse Forte Ltd, the world’s largest hotel, catering and leisure company,
which runs over 800 hotels including more than 200 in Britain. In 1977 there
were over 9,000 licensed restaurants (with a total turnover of about £750
million) in Great Britain, and a further 31,000 unlicensed establishments (with
a total turnover of more than £850 million) including snack bars, cafes, fish and
chip shops and other establishments selling ‘take-away’ food. Britain has a very
wide range of restaurants including a substantial number specialising in the
dishes of other countries such as Chinese, Italian, Indian and Greek foods.
‘Fast food’ catering, in which establishments sell hot food such as hamburgers
or chicken to be eaten either on the premises or elsewhere, is becoming
increasingly significant. Take-away meals now account for more than one-
third of all meals bought in restaurants and other catering establishments.
There are about 56,000 ‘pubs’ (public houses, which mainly sell beer, wines
and spirits for consumption on the premises) in Great Britain, with a total
turnover of more than £3,000 million in 1977.
In June 1978 some 469,000 people were employed in garages, petrol stations
and by motor repairers and distributors in Britain. In spite of the continuing
increase in the number of road vehicles, the number of petrol stations is
declining and in 1979 there were some 26,500 (6 per cent fewer than in 1978),
of which 31 per cent were owned by oil companies. Self-service stations are
becoming increasingly important and in 1979 they accounted for 20 per cent of
petrol stations and more than half of petrol sales in Britain.
Other services provided include hairdressing and manicure (94,000
employees in June 1978), laundries (55,000), dry cleaning, window cleaning,
boot and shoe repair, antique dealing, photocopying, television rentals and
funeral services.
Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources of any country in the European
Community. Minerals as a whole make an important contribution to the
economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in 1978 was £7,282
million, of which coal accounted for 40 per cent, crude oil 39 per cent and
natural gas 6 per cent. The value of mineral production was 30 per cent higher
at constant prices than in 1970, virtually all of the increase being accounted for
by oil and gas.
All minerals in Great Britain are privately owned, with the exception of
gold, silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned by the Crown) and coal and
some minerals associated with coal. On the United Kingdom Continental
Shelf (UKCS) the right to exploit all minerals except coal is vested in the
Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal, or license others to do so, both on
land and under the sea, is vested in the National Coal Board. Normally,
ownership of minerals runs with the ownership of the land surface but in some
areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these rights have become
separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coal, are usually carried out by
privately owned companies.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain
lakes and from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and
nuclear power—are used in Britain, together with some water power;
secondary sources produced from these are electricity, coke and very small
quantities of town gas. During 1980 Britain became self-sufficient in energy in
net terms as a result of the continued growth in offshore oil production. Net
self-sufficiency is likely to be maintained for a number of years. Coal and
nuclear power are nevertheless likely to have an increasingly important role in
Britain’s primary energy supply particularly in the long term. Estimated
operating reserves of coal, Britain’s richest natural resource, are 6,000 million
tonnes, sufficient to support present rates of extraction for 50 years, although
total coal resources are many times higher. A major capital investment pro¬
gramme in the coal industry is in progress. Nuclear power provided about 13
per cent of electricity available through the public supply system in 1979 and
the proportion will grow as further nuclear power stations now under construc¬
tion, or planned, are brought into service.
Privately owned companies predominate in offshore oil and gas production
and oil refining, while publicly owned bodies are responsible for most coal
production, gas distribution, and electricity generation and distribution. The
publicly owned fuel and power industries in Britain employ in total some
500,000 people, just over 2 per cent of the working population; their annual
turnover is about £18,000 million and capital investment about £2,200 million.
In Great Britain the Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for these

industries, except for electricity in Scotland which is the responsibility of the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Government’s energy strategy involves ensuring the security and avail¬
ability of energy supplies, using oil and gas reserves at an optimum rate,
developing competitive coal production, expanding the nuclear power pro¬
gramme, supporting research into renewable sources of energy and encourag¬
ing measures which result in lower energy consumption. Pricing that reflects
the true long-term costs of energy supplies is also central to the Government’s
approach to energy policy, both to discourage the wasteful use of energy and to
stimulate new methods of utilising and saving it.
Britain is actively engaged in international collaboration on energy ques¬
tions, notably through its membership of the European Community and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA, a body with 21 member countries attached
to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Since its
establishment in 1974, the IE A has agreed a wide range of co-operative
measures to achieve the objective of reducing member nations’ dependence on
imported oil. The rapid increase of North Sea oil production, together with the
Government’s policies on coal, nuclear power and energy conservation, has
meant that, from being net oil importers of 41 million tonnes of oil in 1978,
Britain has been able to accept, as a contribution to the European Community’s
response to the world economic summit in Tokyo in 1979, a target for 1985 of
net exports of 5 million tonnes of oil. The Government also attaches consider¬
able importance to the creation of a common understanding between energy
producers and energy consumers.
In 1979 inland primary energy consumption amounted to 355'9 million tonnes
of coal equivalent (see Table 16), 4-7 per cent more than in 1978, reflecting the
very cold weather in the early part of the year. Petroleum accounted for 39-1
per cent of primary consumption, coal 36-4 per cent, natural gas 20 per cent,
nuclear power 3-9 per cent and hydro-electric power o-6 per cent. Energy
consumption by final users in 1979 amounted to 61,701 million therms1 on a
‘heat supplied’ basis. Industrial users consumed about 38 per cent, domestic
users 27 per cent, transport 23 per cent, public services 6 per cent and
agriculture 1 per cent.

Energy conservation has a central place in the Government’s energy strategy
and rational pricing of energy, supported by the provision of conservation
information to consumers, is a major part of energy conservation policy. The

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Secretary of State for Energy is advised by an independent Advisory Council
on Energy Conservation, while studies on energy conservation and alternative
sources of energy are undertaken by a number of organisations, notably the
Energy Technology Support Unit of the Department of Energy and the
National Engineering Laboratory of the Department of Industry.
Several schemes to assist industry and commerce to conserve energy are in
operation, including assistance towards the cost of consultants’ surveys,
energy audits in selected industries and financial assistance for research,
development and demonstration projects. Firms are encouraged to appoint
energy managers (of whom there are some 5,000) to draw up and administer
energy conservation measures in factories and offices. Many firms have
achieved significant economies through measures such as better use of heating
and lighting, improved operational and maintenance techniques, and the
installation of draught-proofing and additional insulation. To improve insula¬
tion in houses, grants towards the installation of basic insulation in uninsulated
roofs are available under the Homes Insulation Act 1978. Following discus¬
sions with the Government, the motor manufacturers are working towards a
voluntary target of a 10 per cent improvement by 1985 in the average mileage
per gallon achieved by new cars sold in Britain. Other conservation measures
have included a maximum limit of 190 Centigrade on heating levels in commer¬
cial and industrial buildings; publication of official fuel consumption figures
for new cars, so that potential purchasers can assess the petrol usage of
different models; the production of teaching material, for primary schools, on
energy and its efficient use; and a government publicity campaign to promote
the efficient use of energy.
The total value of the substantial oil and gas reserves discovered in the United
Kingdom Continental Shelf is estimated at about £300,000 million. It is one of
the world’s most attractive offshore areas for oil and gas, the average success
rate for exploration drilling comparing very favourably with other offshore
areas. Seismic prospecting began in the early 1960s and full-scale exploration
activities in 1964. The total area covered by production licences is some 69,300
square kilometres (26,750 square miles) out of a total designated area of about
643,ooo square kilometres (248,250 square miles), over which Britain has
exercised its rights to explore and exploit the seabed and subsoil. A new round
of offshore petroleum production licensing, the seventh, is being held in 1980.
Large-scale investment has been made in offshore exploration and develop¬
ment, amounting to over £15,000 million (at 1979 prices) so far, of which 92
per cent has been made by private sector industry. Investment in 1979 was
estimated at about £2,000 million. By the end of 1979, 859 exploration or
appraisal wells and 586 development wells had been drilled or begun; of these
49 and 107 respectively were drilled in 1979.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment by
helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators to
identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and promoting
new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry. British com¬
panies increased their share of the offshore market, worth £2,679 million in
I979* from between 25 and 30 per cent in 1973 to 79 per cent in 1979 and are
increasingly involved in supplying other offshore markets.

During most of the twentieth century Britain has been almost wholly depen¬
dent for its oil supplies on imports, the only indigenous supplies coming from a
small number of land-based oilfields. The discovery of oil offshore in the
UKCS has transformed the position, however. The first discovery of oil in the
UKCS was made in 1969 and the first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Britain is
now producing about i-6 million barrels (220,000 tonnes) a day. (For esti¬
mates of the growing economic benefits of North Sea oil revenues see p 202.)
Fifteen fields in the UKCS are producing oil: Brent and Forties, two of the
largest offshore oilfields in the world; Argyll; Auk; Beryl; Claymore; Dunlin;
Heather; Montrose; Ninian; Piper; South Cormorant; Statfjord; Murchison;
and Thistle. A further n fields are under development while more than 40
further significant finds that have been made may prove to be commercial after
further appraisal. Production from most large fields is controlled from produc¬
tion platforms of either steel or concrete which have been built to withstand
severe weather including gusts of wind of up to 257 km/h (160 mph) and waves
of 30 metres (100 feet).
Britain’s primary oil production, including condensates and petroleum
gases, amounted to nearly 78 million tonnes in 1979 (see Table 17), over 40 per
cent more than in 1978 and was equivalent to over four-fifths of Britain’s oil
requirements for energy and non-energy purposes and for international marine
bunkers. Production is expected to continue to rise rapidly, reaching between
80 million and 85 million tonnes in 1980, and rising to between 90 million and
120 million tonnes in 1982. Remaining proven reserves of oil in the UKCS
amount to nearly 1,200 million tonnes while the total remaining reserves of the
UKCS could be as high as 4,200 million tonnes. The Government has
announced that it is in the national interest to prolong high levels of UKCS oil
production until the end of the twentieth century. This requires increased
exploration, which the Government is encouraging, and the deferment of some
oil production from the 1980s.

averaged 3-7 million barrels a day of crude oil and petroleum products in 1979
and its gross income was £23,000 million. It has about 113,000 employees, of
whom 38,700 are employed in Britain.
The British National Oil Corporation, a public corporation set up in 1976, is
engaged in two main activities: as an oil trader on a large scale, mainly by virtue
of its right, through participation agreements with other oil companies, to
purchase 51 per cent of most of the oil produced on the UKCS; and as a
substantial enterprise engaged in North Sea exploration, development and
production. The Government has announced its intention to introduce private
capital into BNOC’s oil-producing business. The oil trading activities will
remain as a wholly government-owned operation.
There are several other large oil companies operating in Britain or engaged
in work on the UKCS. In addition, there are about 30 independent oil
exploration companies with interests in North Sea developments.
Onshore production of crude oil in Britain is much less significant than
offshore production, amounting in 1979 to about 120,000 tonnes. However,
production is expected to grow substantially as output builds up from Britain’s
largest onshore field, at Wytch Farm (Dorset), which started production in
1979. Twelve other onshore fields are in operation, notably Bothamsall and
Egmanton in Nottinghamshire, Gainsborough in Lincolnshire and Kim-
meridge in Dorset.
In 1980 the crude distillation capacity of Britain’s oil refineries amounted to
132-9 million tonnes a year. All but three of the 20 refineries in operation have a
distillation capacity of over 1 million tonnes a year and are shown on the map on
p 266. Three have a crude distillation capacity of over 10 million tonnes a year:
Fawley, near Southampton (17-3 million tonnes); Stanlow, in Cheshire (16-8
million tonnes); and Kent (10-4 million tonnes). Existing refineries are being
adapted to the changing pattern of demand by the construction of new upgrad¬
ing facilities which are leading to a higher output of motor spirit and naphtha at
the expense of fuel oil.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1979 totalled 84-6 million tonnes including 27-5 million
tonnes of fuel oil, 19-9 million tonnes of gas and diesel oil (including derv fuel
used in road vehicles), 18-7 million tonnes of motor spirit and 7-4 million
tonnes of kerosene.
The volume of imports of crude oil has been declining recently (see Table 17);
in 1979 they were valued at over £3,670 million. The main sources were Saudi
Arabia (which supplied about 24 per cent by value), Kuwait (18 per cent), Iraq
(11 per cent) and Norway (7 per cent), while a further 9 per cent was imported
via the Netherlands. The tonnage imported is expected to continue to decline,
although heavy crude oil will still be imported for particular uses.
High quality premium oil from the UKCS is being exported and crude oil
exports, which have risen considerably, accounted for 50 per cent of produc¬
tion in 1979. The value of exports of crude oil amounted to over £2,710 million,
and more than £1,470 million of petroleum products were also exported. Most
oil exports are sent to other countries in Western Europe.
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 80 per cent of offshore oil in 1979. About
750 miles (1,200 kilometres) of submarine pipeline have been built to bring
268

ashore oil from a number of North Sea oilfields (see map). Pipelines distribute
crude oil to refineries from harbours, North Sea land terminals or offshore
moorings capable of berthing very large tankers, for example, from Finnart to
Grangemouth; from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy; from Tran-
mere to Stanlow; from Amlwch (Gwynedd) to Stanlow; and from Cruden Bay
to Grangemouth. Pipelines also carry refined products and petrochemical
feedstocks to major marketing areas; for example, a 300-mile (480-kilometre)
pipeline runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands and Manchester.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities on
a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames (BP),
Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Woodstock in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon in
Oxfordshire (Esso). Work in progress includes the evolution of new and
improved fuels and lubricants, and the development of new uses for petroleum
products and of new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals. The
main Government research and development effort in offshore technology is
undertaken by the Department of Energy with the advice of the Offshore
Energy Technology Board (see p 386). In 1980-81 the Department of Energy
expects to spend some £20 million in support of offshore technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in Westminster in central London. For many years gas was produced
from coal but during the 1960s, when growing supplies of oil were being
imported, there was a switch to producing town gas from oil-based feedstocks.
However, a more significant change began in the late 1960s following the first
commercial natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965 and the start of offshore
gas production in 1967. Supplies of offshore natural gas grew rapidly and
natural gas has now replaced town gas as the source of gas for the public supply
system in Great Britain. Originally used almost exclusively for lighting, gas is
now primarily used for domestic cooking and heating and for industrial and
commercial purposes.
The Gas Act 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain under public
ownership and control in 1949. As a result of the change to natural gas
necessitating more centralised control of production and transmission, the
British Gas Corporation was set up in 1973 under the Gas Act 1972 to
replace the Gas Council and area gas boards. The Corporation’s powers in
connection with its main duty of developing and maintaining an efficient,
co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply and of satisfying reasonable
demands for gas are: to search for and extract natural gas and any oil discovered
in the course of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire, transmit and
distribute gas; to manufacture, supply, or sell by-products; and to manufac¬
ture, install, maintain or remove gas plant and fittings. It has about 104,400
employees.
Natural gas is not available in Northern Ireland and the industry there,
which is controlled by nine municipal undertakings and four private sector
companies, uses town gas produced from oil feedstocks. In 1979 the Govern¬
ment decided that the large-scale expenditure required for a natural gas
pipeline from Great Britain to Northern Ireland could not be justified and that
it could not subsidise the industry’s operations. Accordingly, most of the gas
undertakings have decided that they cannot continue a viable supply of piped
gas and arrangements are in hand for a phased rundown of the industry.

111 1979 indigenous supplies of natural gas were equivalent to about 81 per cent
of total natural gas supplies. Between 1974 and 1979 the quantity of gas sent
out by the public supply system in Britain increased by 29 per cent to 17,315
million therms. Output of natural gas from the UKCS amounted to 39,228
million cubic metres (mem) in 1979, of which 895 mem were used for drilling,
production and pumping operations offshore and 164 mem supplied direct to
the petrochemical industry, leaving 38,169 mcm available for the public
supply gas industry. Production comes mainly from seven major gasfields:
Leman Bank, Indefatigable, Hewett, Viking, Frigg (UK), West Sole and
Rough. In addition, a growing amount of gas produced in association with oil
in oilfields is being brought ashore, particularly from the Forties and Piper
fields. Associated gas from the Tartan field will start to flow towards the end of
1980 and from the Brent field in 1980-81. The British Gas Corporation is
undertaking a major investment programme to develop the Morecambe field in
the Irish Sea.
Indigenous offshore natural gas supplies are expected to be sufficient to
meet the major part of British requirements into the twenty-first century.
Total proven gas reserves remaining in known discoveries in the UKCS at the
end of 1979 amounted to 754,000 mcm and total possible reserves in known
discoveries amounted to 1-5 million mcm.
The national high pressure pipeline system of some 3,500 miles (5,600
kilometres) provides for the distribution of natural gas. It is supplied by feeder
mains from four North Sea shore terminals and from the Canvey Island
terminal which receives tankers carrying liquefied gas imported from Algeria.
Three new pipelines have been built to carry gas from St Fergus (Grampian) to
central Scotland and northern England, while work on a fourth pipeline began
in April 1980 and should be completed in 1982. In the northern North Sea two
225-mile (362-kilometre) pipelines have been laid between the Frigg field and
St Fergus, while the longest offshore pipeline in the UKCS has been laid for
281 miles (452 kilometres) between the Brent field and St Fergus. In June 1980
the Government gave approval for the construction of a major new pipeline to
bring ashore associated gas from the Beryl oilfield and a number of other fields
in the central and northern North Sea. The pipeline should start to bring
ashore gas in 1984-85.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
being developed including additional storage facilities for liquefied natural gas.
The British Gas Corporation has recently acquired the partially depleted
Rough gasfield and intends to use it to store natural gas. It is believed that this
is the first time an offshore gasfield will be used for this purpose.
In 1979 there was a substantial growth in demand for gas following increased
oil prices and uncertainty about oil supplies. Sales of gas by the public supply
industry in Britain totalled 16,591 million therms, 8-4 per cent more than in
1978. About half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation to its 15'3
million consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, most of the
remainder being for household use. Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the
pottery industry and certain processes for making iron and steel products. In
I979> 6,160 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 239 million
therms to public supply and transport power stations and 1,967 million therms
to commercial users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heat¬
ers, water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic

demand is for gas for central heating. In 1979, 8,225 million therms were sold
to domestic users, 13-3 per cent more than in 1978.
In 1979—80 the turnover of the British Gas Corporation and its subsidiary
companies amounted to £3,513 million, of which sales of gas accounted for
£2,977 million. After interest payments there was a profit of £426 million.
Recently the Corporation has been wholly self-financing. It has repaid all its
long-term debt to the Government and is depositing its cash surpluses with the
National Loans Fund. The Corporation has a large investment programme,
amounting to more than £4,000 million in the five years from 1980-81, for new
production, transmission and storage facilities. Capital expenditure on pro¬
jects to increase the availability of gas has been brought forward to help to meet
the growth in demand.
The British Gas Corporation conducts research at five research stations into all
aspects of gas supply and use. Its total expenditure on research and develop¬
ment and on technical service and testing amounted to £36 million in 1979-80.
Work on processes for the manufacture of substitute natural gas (SNG) from
either oil or coal is one of the Corporation’s main research projects and it has a
20-year programme, expected to cost some £300 million, to enable it to
produce commercial quantities of SNG when this is required to augment
supplies of natural gas. A demonstration coal gasification plant has been built
at the Westfield Development Centre in Fife and a prototype plant to make
SNG from oil is planned at Killingholme (Humberside) and should be in
operation by 1982.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century and in
its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 292 million tonnes of coal, exported
98 million tonnes and employed over a million workers. In 1947 the coal mines
passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry Nationalisation
Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a statutory corpora¬
tion to manage the industry.
The NCB has, with limited exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. It also has powers to work other minerals,
where discoveries are made in the course of searching for, or working, coal; and
to engage in certain petrochemical activities beneficial to the future of the coal
industry. Retail sales remain largely in private hands, although the NCB makes
bulk sales to large industrial consumers. Two holding companies, wholly
owned by the NCB, run most of its non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries)
Ltd’s responsibilities include certain retail fuel distribution operations, com¬
puter services and engineering. NCB (Coal Products) Ltd is responsible for
solid smokeless fuel manufacture and chemical and by-products plants.
At the end of March 1980 there were 219 NCB collieries in operation
grouped into 12 areas, each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB.
The main coal-bearing areas are shown on the map on p 272 and the main
trends in the coal industry are shown in Table 18.
In 1979-80 output of 125-1 million tonnes comprised 109-3 million tonnes
from the NCB’s deep mines, 13-4 million tonnes from opencast mines and 2-4
million tonnes from licensed mines and other sources. Britain’s coal industry

remains the largest in Western Europe and is one of the world’s most technolog¬
ically advanced. Substantial progress has been made in techniques for mining
coal. Developments are concentrated on the introduction of computerised
automatic monitoring and remote control of machines, together with the
installation of heavy-duty equipment, such as powered roof supports, power
loaders and armoured flexible conveyors, capable of sustained high perform¬
ance with minimum maintenance. Productivity in terms of output per man¬
shift rose to 2-27 tonnes in 1979-80, 1-5 per cent more than in 1978-79.
In 1979-80 the NCB’s income was £3,863 million including sales of coal of
£3,136 million. Although the NCB made a trading profit of £27-6 million, it
recorded a net loss of £159-3 million after taking account of interest payments
and other items. The NCB’s borrowing limit is £3,400 million, with provision
for an additional increase up to £4,200 million which is subject to
parliamentary approval.
Capital expenditure on collieries amounted to £617 million in 1979-80. The
Board’s Plan for Coal, a general strategy for the ten years to the mid-1980s,
involves investment of £5,300 million at 1979 prices of which nearly half is
expenditure on major new projects. NCB deep mines are expected to be
producing 120 million tonnes a year by the mid-1980s, with about 42 million
tonnes coming from new capacity created under the ‘Plan for Coal’ to replace
that lost by exhaustion of old collieries. Some 43 major projects have already
been completed and new coal mines have been opened at Kinsley and Royston,
both near Barnsley, and at Betws (Dyfed). By far the largest NCB project is the
new mining complex at Selby in North Yorkshire (which will be one of the
world’s most advanced deep mines) where production should start in 1982 and
build up to the full rate of 10 million tonnes a year by 1987-88.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, total coal reserves in Britain are estimated at
190,000 million tonnes, of which about 45,000 million tonnes (sufficient for at
least 300 years at present rates of consumption) are recoverable using existing
mining technology. The NCB’s national exploration programme is proving
fresh reserves of economically workable coal at the rate of 500 million tonnes a
year, four times the annual consumption of coal. A public inquiry has been
held into the NCB’s proposals to develop the North-east Leicestershire coal¬
field, which has recoverable reserves of 520 million tonnes. Other major new
finds have been located at Park (Staffordshire), west of Coventry, under the
Firth of Forth off Musselburgh (Lothian), at Margam (West Glamorgan), and
in north Oxfordshire.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1979-80 internal consumption of coal was 128-3 million tonnes of which 69
per cent went to power stations, 11 per cent to coke ovens and 8 per cent to
domestic users. The proportion of coal used by the electricity supply industry
compared with other fuels used for generation has increased, and NCB sales of
coal to power stations reached a record 86-3 million tonnes in 1979-80.
Exports of coal in 1979-80 were 2-5 million tonnes, almost all of which
went to Western European countries, while imports amounted to 5-1 million
tonnes.
In 1979-80 the NCB spent £41 million on research. It has two main research
organisations: the Coal Research Establishment (CRE) at Stoke Orchard
(Gloucestershire), concerned with the combustion and utilisation of coal; and
the Mining Research and Development Establishment at Stanhope Bretby
(Staffordshire), for work on mining methods and equipment, particularly
improving the performance and reliability of existing equipment and develop¬
ing systems for remote and automatic control. Two CRE processes are being
developed for converting coal to liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks. Pilot
plants are planned for construction at Point of Ayr (Clwyd).
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the
NCB with several countries. Britain is responsible through an NCB subsidiary
for managing a programme of international coal research projects on behalf of
the International Energy Agency. Five collaborative coal research projects,
including a £17 million project to develop pressurised fluidised bed combus¬
tion (a method of steam-raising for power generation) are based in Britain.
The first public supply of electricity in Britain was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and
I957) effected a measure of decentralisation and established the present struc¬
ture of public corporations. Electricity from the public supply system is
available to virtually all premises in Britain, the only exceptions being very
remote rural households.
The Electricity Council is the central co-ordinating body of the supply indus¬
try in England and Wales. It has a general responsibility for promoting the
development and maintenance of an efficient, co-ordinated and economical
system of electricity supply. Electricity is generated and transmitted by the
Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the
operation and maintenance of power stations and the main transmission system
(national grid). Twelve area electricity boards are responsible for distribution
and for the retail sale of electricity. The chairman and two designated members
of the CEGB, together with the chairman of the area electricity boards, are
among the members of the board of the Electricity Council.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separat¬
ing their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the
Firth of Tay (see map, p 276). Each board has a chairman and between four
and eight members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried
out by the publicly owned Northern Ireland Electricity Service.

In 1979-80 the income of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales
was £6,171 million and its profit after interest payments was £37 million. In
Scotland the income of the SSEB and the NSHEB was £519 million and £203
million respectively and their profits were £o-i million and £1-7 million. In
1979-80 the Northern Ireland Electricity Service’s income totalled £193
million and it had a net deficit of £i5-7 million. Annual capital investment
amounts to £834 million in England and Wales, £107 million in Scotland and
£54 million in Northern Ireland. The statutory limit to borrowings by the
industry in England and Wales is £6,500 million, in Northern Ireland £650
million and in Scotland £1,500 million, with provision for a further increase up
to £1,950 million. About 183,000 people are employed in the electricity supply
industry in Britain.
Generation by the public supply electricity industry in Britain reached a record
279,482 gigawatt hours (GWh)1 in 1979, 4-8 per cent more than in 1978.
Conventional steam power stations provided 86 per cent of the total, nuclear
stations 12 per cent and gas turbine, hydro-electric and diesel plant 2 per cent.
Public supply power stations in Britain consumed 122 million tonnes of coal
equivalent in 1979 of which coal accounted for 73 per cent and oil 15 per cent.
The output capacity of the 222 generating stations of the electricity boards in
Britain at the end of 1979 totalled 68,882 megawatts (MW) including 56,765
MW run by the CEGB, 8,060 MW by the SSEB, 2,094 MW by the NSHEB
and 1,938 MW by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service. An analysis of
electricity generation by and output capacity of the public supply system in
Britain is given in Table 19.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
(20,509 GWh in 1979). The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). In 1979 these nuclear plants supplied
3,182 GWh of electricity to the public supply system.
New large-scale power stations are based on units of 500 MW

and 660 MW. Station capacities have increased and there are n stations each
with a capacity of 2,000 MW including Kingsnorth (Kent), Europe’s largest
mixed-fuel station burning either coal or oil, while Britain’s largest power
station is at Longannet (Fife), a 2,400 MW station with four cross-compound
units. The larger units have a higher thermal efficiency (the ratio of the net
electrical energy output to the heat energy input) than earlier units and their
introduction, coupled with the closure of less efficient plant has resulted in a
gradual rise in thermal efficiency, leading to substantial savings in fuel con¬
sumption. Average thermal efficiency of conventional steam stations in
England and Wales rose from 20-91 per cent in 1947-48 to 31-68 per cent in
1979-80 when the CEGB’s 20 most efficient stations had an average thermal
efficiency of 33-74 per cent.
About 15,000 MW of plant are under construction including a 2,000 MW
coal-fired extension to the Drax station (North Yorkshire) and five nuclear
power stations (see below). Work is also in progress on the construction of a
pumped-storage station at Dinorwic (Gwynedd), which will be the largest of
its type in the world when completed in 1983 and will have an average
generated output of 1,680 MW. (In pumped-storage schemes electricity gen¬
erated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to high-level reservoirs from
which it descends to drive turbines, rapidly providing a large supply of
electricity at peak periods or to meet sudden increases in demand.) A further
large-scale pumped-storage scheme is being considered by the NSHEB for
construction at Craigroyston on Loch Lomond.
A new combined heat and power (CHP) station designed to sell heat
normally discharged to the atmosphere as a by-product of electricity genera¬
tion to neighbouring firms was opened at Hereford in March 1980. It is a 15
MW station with thermal efficiency of around 76 per cent. In April 1980 the
Government announced the inauguration of a programme to test the feasibility
of CHP and district heating in particular locations in Britain.
Britain has been developing nuclear power since 1956 when the world’s first
large-scale nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to supply
electricity to the national grid. The Government believes that nuclear power
has a vital role in helping to meet Britain’s long-term energy requirements.
Accordingly, it is supporting the electricity supply industry’s plans to order at
least one new nuclear power station a year between 1982 and 1991, represent¬
ing a ten-year programme of some 15,000 MW.
There are 11 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the electricity
authorities, while a further five stations are controlled by the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (see p 387) or British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. The
UKAEA has three experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity
into the national grid: the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale,
Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor at Winfrith,
Dorset (100 MW); and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PER) at Dounreay,
Highland (250 MW). BNFL operates the two original Magnox stations, both
with a capacity of 198 MW, at Calder Hall and Chapelcross (Dumfries and
Galloway).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total
gross capacity of about 4,000 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971.
They range in size from Berkeley (Gloucestershire) with a capacity of 332 MW
to the most recent, Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a capacity of 990 MW. The

second main programme was based on the AGR and the first two commercial
AGRs, 1,320 MW stations at Hinkley Point B (Somerset) and Hunterston B
(Strathclyde), began operating in 1976. Three AGRs (Dungeness B, Kent,
1,200 MW; Hartlepool, Cleveland, 1,320 MW; and Heysham, Lancashire,
1,320 MW) are under construction and the first units should be commissioned
in 1981 or 1982. Initial work on two more AGRs, a 1,320 MW extension at
Heysham and a 1,320 MW station at Torness (Lothian), has also started. It is
intended that the next reactor order will be for a pressurised water reactor
system (the main type in use overseas), subject to the necessary consents and
safety clearances being obtained. Government policy on fast reactor develop¬
ment, including whether or not to proceed with a full-scale commercial
demonstration fast reactor, is under review. Any decision to proceed would be
subject to a full public inquiry.
BNFL provides nuclear fuel services covering the design and development of
plant, procurement and processing of uranium, uranium enrichment, fuel
element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel, and the manu¬
facture of specialised components and preparation of radioactive materials. All
of BNFL’s shares are held by the UKAEA on behalf of the Government.
BNFL is organised into three divisions covering uranium enrichment, based at
Capenhurst (Cheshire); fuel manufacture at Springfields (Lancashire); and
reprocessing at Windscale (Cumbria) where uranium, plutonium and radioac¬
tive wastes are separated from irradiated fuel. BNFL’s head office is at Risley
(Cheshire). It is engaged on a large-scale investment programme costing about
£2,500 million over the next ten years. This includes the refurbishing of
facilities for storing and reprocessing spent fuel from Magnox power stations,
the doubling of capacity of the centrifuge enrichment plant at Capenhurst, the
construction of a new thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) at Wind-
scale which will deal with spent fuel from Britain’s AGRs and will also
reprocess spent fuel for a number of overseas customers, and the construction
of a demonstration plant for vitrifying radioactive waste.
The British system is the largest fully interconnected power network under
unified control in the western world. By 31st March 1980 the main transmis¬
sion lines of the CEGB totalled 14,123 circuit kilometres, of which 11,666
circuit kilometres were at 400,000 volts and the remainder at 275,000 volts.
Primary distribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary
distribution at 33,000 volts, tertiary at 11,000 volts or below and general low
voltage distribution at 240 volts single phase. In Scotland there were 8,671
circuit kilometres of main transmission lines at the end of March 1980 of which
340 kilometres operated at 400,000 volts, 3,256 circuit kilometres at 275,000
volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary distribution in Scotland is at
33,000 volts. The national grid in England and Wales is divided into seven grid
control areas and operations are co-ordinated by a National Control Centre in
London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres at Pitlochry
(NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch (SSEB).
Twin cross-Channel cables between Lydd and Boulogne are capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW. Experience with this relatively low-capacity link
demonstrated the benefits of the transfer of electricity between Britain and
France. The CEGB and Electricite de France are proposing a 2,000 MW cable
link between Folkestone and Sangatte (near Calais) to allow much larger
quantities of electricity to be exchanged. The first 1,000 MW stage should be
commissioned in 1984 and the second stage in 1985.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES 279
Sales of electricity in 1979 amounted to 240,786 GWh. Industry took 39-4 per
cent of the total, domestic users 37-2 per cent and commercial and other users
the remainder. About one-fifth of domestic sales is for space heating, one-
quarter for water heating and one-tenth for cooking. Electricity is used in
industry mainly for motive power, melting, heating and lighting. The elec¬
tricity industry supplies 23-1 million consumers of whom 20-4 million are in
England and Wales, i'6 million are supplied by the SSEB, 536,000 by the
NSHEB and 522,000 by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research com¬
prising direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisa¬
tions. Much of the work is carried out in collaboration with the SSEB, the
NSHEB and the Northern Ireland Electricity Service which contribute
towards the cost of research (£66-2 million in 1979-80). Collaboration on
research between the supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co¬
ordinated by the Power Engineering Research Steering Committee. The
research establishments run by the CEGB comprise the Central Electricity
Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the Berkeley Nuclear
Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood Engineering
Laboratories on Southampton Water. Research on distribution technology
and electricity utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council Research
Centre at Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
Research is in progress on assessing the potential contribution of alternative
sources of energy (sea-wave, wind and tidal power for electricity generation,
and solar and geothermal energy for low-grade heat for domestic and industrial
uses) and the ways in which they may be harnessed. Development in Britain is
at an early stage and they are not expected to make a major contribution to
energy supplies in the next few years, although they may have a more signifi¬
cant role in the long term as indigenous offshore oil and gas production
declines. In principle, the most promising long-term renewable sources are
wave power (because of Britain’s long coastline and favourable geographical
position) and solar heat.
The aim of the Government’s wave power programme is to develop the most
appropriate devices to full-scale prototypes for sea trials. Work is in progress on
a number of types of wave energy devices and includes one-tenth scale trials,
full-scale component development, test tank experiments and the study of
problems common to all the devices. In 1977 a four-year government-funded
programme of research and development on solar energy was inaugurated to
identify its potential contribution and to stimulate the development of cost-
effective solar technologies, particularly on water and space heating in houses
(the areas of greatest potential return).
Research on geothermal energy involves collection of data in the areas
considered to have the most suitable conditions and assessment of the markets
for the relatively low-grade heat produced. The first exploratory borehole in
Britain directed towards geothermal deposits was drilled near Southampton
in 1979-80. The Department of Energy and an industrial consortium
are working on a project to establish the technical and economic potential
for generating electricity from wind power. A detailed design study for
a large aerogenerator has been completed and the first stage in the
280

construction of a 3-7 MW prototype, covering detailed design and
component testing, is in progress. Studies have been made of a project
for harnessing the tides in the Severn Estuary, one of the world’s most
suitable sites for tidal power, and the Government has set up an independent
Severn Barrage Committee to assist in reaching a decision on whether to
proceed with such a project. The Committee has found that such a project
would be technically feasible.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although much of Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials is met by
imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important contribu¬
tion to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1978 totalled 319 million
tonnes, valued at £1,021 million. The total number of employees in the
industry was 42,900 in 1978. The geographical locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p 282.
The exploration for and exploitation of indigenous mineral resources to meet
the requirements of British industry are being encouraged by the Government
to minimise dependence on imports. Under the Mineral Exploration and
Investment Grants Act 1972 there is provision for financial assistance of up to
35 per cent of the cost of searching for mineral deposits in Great Britain and on
the UKCS and evaluating them for commercial purposes. Minerals included
in the scheme are the ores of non-ferrous metals, fluorspar, barium minerals
and potash. By the end of March 1980, 57 companies had sought assistance
totalling £5-9 million in respect of 186 exploration projects, mainly for non-
ferrous metals. Work on 126 projects had been completed. A similar scheme
was introduced in Northern Ireland in 1979.
The Institute of Geological Sciences is carrying out for the Department of
Industry a programme aimed at identifying areas with the potential for
economic extraction of minerals. It also has a programme for the Department
of the Environment to assess resources of sand and gravel, and limestone.
The tonnage extracted of some of the main non-fuel minerals produced in
Britain is given in Table 20. In terms of value, production of sand and gravel
was estimated at £298 million in i97^> limestone £228 million, igneous rock

£141 million, clays £110 million, sandstone £55 million, non-ferrous ores £38
million, chalk £22 million, gypsum and anhydrite £14 million, iron ore £12
million and fluorspar £10 million.
Britain is a major world producer of several important industrial minerals
including china clay, ball clay, fuller’s earth and gypsum, and also produces
significant amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, fluorspar, potash (pro¬
duced at Boulby in Cleveland), salt, industrial sands, fireclay, common clay
and shale, barytes, talc and celestite, mostly for home consumption. Small
amounts of diatomite, slate, calcspar, chert and flint, anhydrite and china
stone are also produced. In 1978 the production of metal from non-ferrous ores
totalled 10,700 tonnes including 4,600 tonnes of lead-in-ore (mostly from
northern England). Output of tin-in-ore, mostly from Cornwall, was 3,200
tonnes, supplying 26 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements. Small amounts of
copper, zinc and silver were produced in association with the tin. The South
Crofty tin mine near Camborne is one of the largest tin mines in the world.
Britain’s only tungsten mine, near Penrith (Cumbria), was reopened in 1977
and its capacity increased in 1978.
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock (from limestone, igneous rock
and sandstone) as aggregates for use in construction constitutes over half of
Britain’s output of non-fuel minerals. Britain is the world’s second largest
producer of marine-dredged sand and gravel (15-8 million tonnes in 1978).
WATER
Britain’s water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and partly from underground sources
by means of wells, adits and boreholes. Water consumption in Britain con¬
tinues to increase and in 1978 amounted to about 18-3 million cubic metres a
day (mcmd), comprising 17-6 mcmd of potable (drinkable) water and 0-7
mcmd of non-potable water. Average daily consumption per head was 329
litres.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption.
Responsibility for promoting a national policy for water in England and Wales
rests with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales and the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food who, under the Water Act 1973,
are charged with responsibility for securing the conservation, augmentation,
distribution and proper use of water resources and the provision of water
supplies; the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services; the restora¬
tion and maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters;
the use of inland waters for navigation and recreation; the provision of land
drainage; and the protection and development of fisheries.
The National Water Council advises and assists ministers and water
authorities. It consists of a chairman appointed by the Secretaries of State, the
chairmen of the water authorities, and ten other members with special relevant
knowledge, of whom eight are appointed by the Secretaries of State and two by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services; the development
of water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution
(see p 185); sewerage and sewage treatment; river management; land drain¬
age; sea defences; recreation; and freshwater fisheries. Each water authority
has a membership consisting of a chairman and several members appointed by
the Secretary of State for the Environment (or, in the case of the Welsh
Authority, by the Secretary of State for Wales), a few members appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (for the English authorities
only) and a small majority of members appointed by the county and district
councils within the area of the authority. District councils usually act as agents
of water authorities for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of
public sewers in their areas.
There are 29 statutory water supply companies, accounting for about one-
quarter of total supplies, operating under the Water Act 1973. Special
arrangements govern the relationship of statutory water companies to the
water authorities.
Some 12,678 million cubic metres of water were abstracted in England and
Wales in 1978. Public water supplies, reaching over 99 per cent of the popu¬
lation, accounted for 5,709 million cubic metres. The Central Electricity
Generating Board took 4,496 million cubic metres, primarily for cooling in
connection with electricity generation, other industry 2,375 million cubic
metres and the remainder was used in agriculture. Water authorities’ estimated
revenue for 1980-81 is some £1,671 million.
Water authorities have powers to restrict consumption when there are severe
water shortages. Under the Drought Act 1976, passed in the driest period of
weather since records began to be kept in 1727, they can limit or prohibit the
use of water and, if necessary, restrict domestic water supplies.
In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. Additionally
the Central Scotland Water Development Board, established under the Water
(Scotland) Act 1967, is primarily responsible for developing large water
sources and supplying water in bulk to its five constituent member authorities,
the regional councils in Central Scotland.
Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
Over 98 per cent of the population has a public water supply. About 840
million cubic metres of water were abstracted in Scotland in 1979 for public
water supplies. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the
promotion of the conservation of water resources and the provision by water
authorities of adequate water supplies, and also has a duty to promote the
cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters and the tidal waters of
Scotland.
The Water Service of the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is
responsible for water supply and sewerage in Northern Ireland. The Depart¬
ment is also responsible for the conservation, cleanliness and planned
development of Northern Ireland’s water resources. Northern Ireland has
abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic and industrial use.
About 150 million gallons (682 million litres) of water a day are supplied to
over 90 per cent of the population.

Investment is taking place in projects intended to ensure that there is an
adequate water supply to meet the expected rise in demand. Among the new
reservoirs being built is the Kielder Reservoir in Northumberland, which will
be one of the largest man-made reservoirs in Europe when completed towards
the end of 1980. In 1979-80 capital expenditure on water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal amounted to £452 million in England and Wales, £82 million
in Scotland and £26 million in Northern Ireland.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the Water
Research Centre at Henley-on-Thames (Oxfordshire). The Centre’s labora¬
tory at Stevenage (Hertfordshire) is concerned with water pollution including
sewage and industrial waste water treatment, sludge treatment and disposal,
flow measurement, estuarine pollution and the development of analytical
methods and quality monitoring systems. Its laboratory at Medmenham
(Buckinghamshire) deals with water resources, water treatment, health
aspects of water quality, distribution and operational research.
Other research is conducted by the Hydraulics Research Station of the
Department of the Environment at Wallingford (Oxfordshire), which predicts
the performance of hydraulic civil engineering works and their effects on the
environment; the Institute of Hydrology of the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC) at Wallingford, which studies the whole hydrologi¬
cal cycle; the Meteorological Office, which is concerned with rainfall; and the
Institute of Geological Sciences, also part of the NERC, which is concerned
with water resources.
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying
on imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its
most important industries. It occupies 648,000 people or 2.6 per cent of
the total civilian working population, provides about 2-4 per cent of the gross
domestic product, and uses nearly 19 million of the 24 million hectares (47
million of the 60 million acres) of land. Exports in and related to the agricul¬
tural sector (including machinery and fertilisers) in 1979 amounted to nearly
£3*743 million.
THE LAND AND The soils of the country are varied (see p 4). Land used for farming is usually
ITS USES divided into that suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing.
In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is usually
supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and grass.
Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland and other land on agricultural
holdings together represent 78 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain
and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming is
gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing, industry and road trans¬
port; so far, the loss has been offset by the increase in productivity on the land
being farmed.
Size and There are about 257,000 farming units in Britain. About half are very small
Ownership of units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for 10 per cent of the industry’s
Farms total output. Some 30,000 large farm businesses (capable of employing four or
more full-time workers), accounting for a little over 10 per cent of the number
of holdings, produce about half of the industry’s total output. There are about
45,000 medium-sized (two or three workers) and some 50,000 small full-time
farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been encour¬
aged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings is
about 113 hectares (279 acres) of crops and grass and rough grazings.
In Great Britain about 65 per cent of the farms, and in Northern Ireland
almost all farms, are owner-occupied.
Types of British agriculture is characterised by the preponderance of livestock farming.
Farming Three-fifths of the full-time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or
beef cattle and sheep; one in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise
in pigs, poultry or horticulture, or are mixed farms. The farms devoted
primarily to arable crops are found mainly in the eastern parts of England and
Scotland. Large-scale potato and vegetable production is undertaken in the
Fens (in south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around
the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early
potatoes are an important crop in south-west Wales and south-west England.

Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural
crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly in better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 42 per cent of
the full-time farms, while a further 37 per cent concentrate on beef and
sheep production. The remainder specialise in other products or are mixed
farms.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 435,000
tractors in 1979, or one to every 16 hectares (39 acres) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements characterise arable farming; and some 57,600 combine
harvesters were in use in 1979. A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all
except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of farms have an electricity supply and accompanying
equipment. Through machinery syndicates farmers have the use of expensive
equipment whose capital cost is shared among members.
Britain produces 55 per cent of its total food requirements. Some 70 per cent of
the country’s supplies of indigenous-type foods (that is, foods grown commer¬
cially in significant quantities) are home grown. Home production of the
principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight of total supplies (that is,
output plus imports less exports) in Table 21.

Britain has a long tradition of efficient farming based on technological progress
and research. Modern farming methods were first pioneered as early as the
eighteenth century. The rapid growth of productivity in recent years is due
largely to advisory services based on research, much of which is undertaken by
the Government.
The expansion in production and in yields per hectare over the last decade
despite falling manpower is summarised in Table 22. There has been a
substantial growth in the number of beef cattle and a less marked increase in
the number of dairy cattle, sheep, and poultry. Total cereal production has
increased by almost a third. Potato yields are highly dependent on weather
conditions, but in the past decade yields have tended to rise, so that the crop

has usually continued to supply over 90 per cent of home demand, despite the
reduced area. Increases in output of meat and milk have been associated with
higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. In 1979
some 4-6 million tonnes of concentrated feeds were imported; the level of
imports depends, however, on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product at constant prices (1975 — 100), rose
from 99 in 1969 to an estimated 114 in 1979. (The relatively low level in 1975,
the base year, was due to unfavourable weather; the indices for the years
1971-74 ranged between in and 114.)
Wheat is grown mainly in eastern and southern England. About half the crop is
normally used for flour milling, the remainder mainly for animal feed.
Since i960 the area under barley has increased by about 75 per cent. In
recent years, between 15 and 23 per cent of the crop has been used for malting
and distilling; most of the remainder is used as feed for livestock.
The universal use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation of
drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often used
on a co-operative basis.
There has been a decline in the area of traditional fodder crops since i960
because farmers have been able to provide winter feed more economically by
increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. Apart from
grass, the main fodder crops are field beans, maize and kale, principally used to
supplement grass, hay and silage for winter feeding.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides about 45 per cent of requirements
and is grown under contract to the British Sugar Corporation Ltd. Most of the
other sugar used in Britain is refined from raw sugar imported from developing
countries under the Lome Convention (see p 76).
Harvesting of early potatoes starts at the end of May, and of main-crop varieties
usually in September. Seed potato production is chiefly centred in Scotland
and Northern Ireland; a substantial quantity is exported.
Hops, grown for the brewing industry, occupy only about 6,000 hectares
(15,ooo acres) but have a very high yield per hectare and value by weight.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grass supplies about 80 per cent
of feed requirements of cattle and sheep (in terms of energy); its production
has been enhanced over recent years by the development and application of
new techniques, notably the increased use of fertilisers, new methods of
grazing control, improved herbage conservation for winter feed and irrigation.
Rough grazings are used for extensively-grazed sheep and cattle, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.
A number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over the
centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers to replenish and improve their herds and flocks. In recent
years farmers have introduced and developed a number of breeds of cattle and
sheep from elsewhere in Europe.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, most of
the dairy cattle in England and Wales and a significant proportion in Scotland
and Northern Ireland being bred in this way.

In England, Scotland and Wales about half of the milk produced goes for liquid
consumption and the remainder for manufacture, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Average consump¬
tion of liquid milk per head in 1979 by domestic households in Great Britain
was estimated at about 2-56 litres (4-5 pints) a week. The level of British
consumption of fresh milk is half as high again as the average in the European
Community.

a quarter and were some 4,635 litres (1,020 gallons) in 1979. Freedom from
tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate brucellosis
is well advanced. Milk production has been stimulated by advances in grass¬
land management, new methods of grass conservation and programmes of
controlled use of concentrated feedingstuffs.
The average size of dairy herds in 1979 was some 49 cows a herd, the largest
in the European Community.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is predominant. While pure-bred Friesians
make a substantial contribution to Britain’s beef supplies, many other dairy
cows are crossed with beef bulls for beef production.
The hill and upland areas are important in the production of store cattle
which are moved to lowland pastures for fattening.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production, with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between these breeds. Research has provided vaccine and sera
protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
In hill areas, where winters are usually severe, hardy native breeds are used
for the rearing of lambs. Most of the lambs are transferred each autumn to
lowland farms for fattening, while some ewes are taken to farms at intermediate
altitudes for mating with rams of a larger and more rapidly maturing breed;
then, the cross-bred female progeny pass on to the milder lowland conditions,
where they are often crossed again with Down rams for fat lamb production.
The hill breeds bring in hardiness, and the lowland sires fecundity and early
maturity. Lamb production is the main source of income for sheep farmers but
wool is also important, especially in hill areas.
Pig production is carried on in most areas but is particularly important in
eastern and southern England, north-east Scotland and Northern Ireland.
There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger herds.
Artificial insemination is available nationally. About a third of the pigmeat is
used for bacon, a third for pork and a third for processing into sausages, pies
and other products.
The poultry industry has expanded rapidly, aided by improved husbandry and
management techniques in intensive production units and by genetic
improvements in stock. Some 85 per cent of the laying birds on farms are in
flocks of 5,000 or more, while about 74 per cent of the broilers are in flocks of
50,000 or more. The average yield of eggs per bird is about 245 a year. Nearly
all eggs and poultry meat consumed in Britain are home-produced.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flowers, which are worth about 10 per cent of the total value of agricultural
output; in 1979 their value was estimated at £783 million.
In 1979 the land on which these crops were grown amounted to nearly
295,000 hectares (729,000 acres), about 2-3 per cent of the land used for crops
and grass. Fruit accounted for about 59,000 hectares (146,000 acres), veg¬
etables grown in the open, excluding potatoes, for about 222,000 hectares
(548,000 acres) and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for about 11,000 hectares
(27,000 acres). Crops under glass, plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms,
occupied about 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings, but some,

particularly vegetables for processing, are produced on arable farms. Most
horticultural enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of
improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environmental
control, and the widespread use of machinery.
Field vegetables account for some 44 per cent of the horticultural output and
are widely spread over the country, with the most intensive concentrations in
the Thames Valley and the Vale of Evesham and extensive production in the
eastern counties. Some 15 per cent are destined for processing.
Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop. Britain is one of the few
countries which grow varieties of apples especially suitable for cooking; these
are produced in England and Northern Ireland. Some high-quality pears are
produced in the east and south-east of England. Cherries and plums are grown
in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and parts of East Anglia.
Around Perth in Scotland is the world’s largest concentration of raspberry
plantations.
Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, with early production in
the south and west of England. Blackcurrants are also widely grown, mainly for
the manufacture of soft drinks and of flavouring for confectionery. Other fruits
include gooseberries, red and white currants, loganberries and blackberries.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of government grants. Widespread
use is made of units with automatic control of heating and ventilation, semi¬
automatic control of watering and carbon-dioxide enrichment of the atmos¬
phere. Tomatoes are the most important crop, and, together with lettuce and
cucumbers, represent some 95 per cent of the total value of glasshouse veg¬
etable output. Mushrooms are grown in specially constructed sheds in most
parts of Britain, with concentrations in south-eastern and northern England.
Flowers and bulbs grown in the open occupied some 4,000 hectares (9,880
acres) in June 1979, and hardy nursery stock some 7,000 hectares (17,300
acres).
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private traders, but also
through producers’ co-operatives and marketing boards. The boards are essen¬
tially producers’ organisations with certain statutory powers to regulate the
marketing of particular products. A scheme to establish a marketing board
must be approved by Parliament and (except in the case of Northern Ireland
boards) by a majority of the producers concerned. Most of the members of each
board are elected by registered producers and a small minority of independent
members are appointed by Agricultural Ministers. Various safeguards exist to
protect the public interest generally, including the interests of individual
producers and consumers. Most marketing boards either buy from all regis¬
tered producers or control all contracts between producers and first buyers.
This applies to the marketing boards for milk, wool and hops. The Potato
Marketing Board, on the other hand, maintains only a broad control over
marketing conditions, leaving producers free to deal individually with buyers.
The Milk Marketing Boards are formally recognised as part of the European
Community milk regime.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations rep¬
resenting producer, distributor and independent interests. The object of the

Home-Grown Cereals Authority is to improve the marketing of home-grown
cereals. It provides a market intelligence service and promotes research and
development. It also acts as agent for the Intervention Board for Agricultural
Produce (see p 43) with regard to cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission’s range of functions includes the
promotion and improvement of many activities concerning livestock and live¬
stock products in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, the Livestock Marketing
Commission promotes better organisation, development and marketing in the
livestock and livestock products industry. The Eggs Authority has the general
duty of improving the marketing of eggs.
Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community (see
p 292) a wide range of horticultural produce (both home-grown and imported)
is subject to common quality standards.
Agricultural co-operatives are concerned with marketing, production, ser¬
vices, and with supply of farmers’ requirements. There are, in addition,
machinery syndicates.
The Government provides grants for co-operative production and market¬
ing of agricultural and horticultural produce on the recommendation of the
Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, a statutory
body for promotion and development of co-operation among farmers and
growers throughout Britain.
The aggregate net farming income in 1979 is estimated at £1,193 million
(excluding stock appreciation). Of the total farm output, estimated at £7,975
million in 1979, about two-thirds was in the form of livestock and livestock
products.
Feedingstuffs amount to approximately one-third of agriculture’s total cost,
and wages and machinery (including depreciation) to about one-fifth each. In
recent years agricultural workers’ earnings have risen in real terms but the
labour force has continued to decline because of increased mechanisation and
larger farms. Labour productivity (defined as gross product per person
engaged in agriculture) rose by about 3-5 per cent a year on average between
1969 and 1979.
It is estimated that £388 million was invested in buildings and works in 1979
and £687 million in plant, machinery and vehicles. Most of the capital for
investment is generated from within the farm business. Banks are the main
source of short- and medium-term credit. Mortgage loans form the chief source
of long-term credit and are provided by specialised financial institutions (see
p 293) and private sources.
In 1978-79 the average net income (excluding stock appreciation of breeding
livestock) for different types of full-time farm in England and Wales varied
from about £30 per hectare (£12 per acre) on hill and upland sheep farms with
large areas of rough grazing to £170 per hectare (£69 per acre) on specialist
dairy farms with the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural
holdings which are typically more intensive in their use of land.
Responsibility for carrying out the Government’s agricultural policy is vested
in the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in England; and the
respective Secretaries of State in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
day-to-day work is carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and

Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh
Office Agriculture Department, and the Northern Ireland Department of
Agriculture.
Market arrangements under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the
European Community are administered by the Intervention Board for
Agricultural Produce, which is responsible to the Agricultural Ministers.
Under the CAP, producers’ returns for most of the main commodities are
supported by a combination of charges on imports from outside the Com¬
munity and internal support prices which are maintained by intervention
buying when necessary. In addition, export refunds enable Community expor¬
ters to sell on world markets when world prices are below Community price
levels. There is also provision for certain direct payments to producers,
including beef premiums. CAP support price levels, as well as rates of levy and
subsidy, are set in European currency units (see p 77) and are converted into
the currencies of the member States at fixed rates of exchange (commonly
called ‘green rates’) which do not vary automatically in line with changes in real
exchange rates. The green rates can thus be out of line with the market rate of
exchange between each currency and the European Currency Unit, giving rise
to different real support price levels in the different member States. Monetary
compensatory amounts, based on the percentage difference between the green
and market rates of each currency, are applied to prevent distortions in trade.
They operate as import subsidies and export levies for countries whose curren¬
cies’ market rates are below the green rates, and as import levies and export
subsidies in the opposite case.
The level of support prices under the CAP is reviewed by the Community
each year. The Government is seeking significant improvements in the
operation of the CAP; it believes that support prices should be set at levels
which do not produce unwanted surpluses but offer security to reasonably
efficient producers. The storage and disposal of the surpluses adds signifi¬
cantly to the Community’s budget expenditure. The Government would
particularly like to see the removal of the major structural surpluses of dairy
products and sugar.
The Community’s agricultural expenditure is channelled through the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund’s
guarantee section is used to finance market support arrangements, while
the guidance section finances expenditure on structural reform (for example
contributions to capital and production grants—see p 293). The CAP absorbs
over 70 per cent of the Community’s budget; most of this is attributable to the
cost of storage and disposal of agricultural surpluses, particularly milk pro¬
ducts.
Sheep producers receive guarantee payments if average weekly market prices
fall below guaranteed levels. For sheepmeat, however, agreement was reached
in May 1980 on the establishment of a Community regime providing in effect
for the continuation in Britain of a deficiency payments system with a guaran¬
teed return to producers financed by the Community. The regime which
comes into force in October 1980 also provides for an annual quota for New
Zealand lamb of 234,000 tons and the halving of the tariff on such lamb.
For wool and (except in Northern Ireland) for potatoes, the Govern¬
ment operates the guarantees through the appropriate marketing boards.
The Potato Marketing Board may, with government agreement, undertake
support buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stockfeed. In

Northern Ireland, the potato guarantee is operated by the Department of
Agriculture.
In addition to market support under the CAP and the British guaranteed
prices, producers receive support through certain capital and production
grants, some of them based on Community decisions. The grants include, for
example, those paid under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme
(towards the implementation of farmers’ development plans) and under the
Farm Capital Grant Scheme and Horticulture Capital Grant Scheme (towards
the cost of capital investment).
There is also a Payments to Outgoers Scheme designed to assist in the
improvement of farm structure and a Milk Non-Marketing and Conversion
Scheme under which grants are available to farmers who cease production of
milk for sale, with advantageous rates if they convert to beef or sheep produc¬
tion. Special financial assistance is available under Community and national
arrangements for farmers in less favoured (hill) areas. Community assistance
may also be made available for improvements to facilities for the marketing and
processing of agricultural products. There are also grants for co-operatives.
Expenditure in 1979-80 on price guarantees, grants and subsidies and on CAP
market regulation is estimated at about £333 million and £406 million respec¬
tively. An estimated £430 million was reimbursed from the Community.
Each year the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and pros¬
pects of the industry in consultation with representatives of producers (the
farmers’ unions). In addition, there is continuing consultation with the
farmers’ unions and other interested organisations on developments in the
CAP.
The National Economic Development Council (see p 203) has a committee
for agriculture, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and land-
owners, as well as official and independent members.
In England and Wales, mortgage loans for the purchase or improvement of
agricultural land and buildings are available from the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd, a company which has some government financial backing
but raises its funds on the London capital market. The Scottish Agricultural
Securities Corporation Ltd fulfils a similar role in Scotland.
In any part of Britain, the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd may provide
guarantees for bank loans. The Corporation may receive government help if
necessary.
In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which also helps to identify problems requiring investigation
and research, suggests priorities for such work, and, where appropriate,
contributes to possible solutions. ADAS provides free impartial advice to
landowners, farmers and growers, but charges are made for certain services.
In Scotland the advisory service is provided by the three regional indepen¬
dent colleges of agriculture financed almost entirely by public funds.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Department
of Agriculture. The resources of the agricultural colleges, the research centres
and the specialist divisions of the Department are available to the advisory
service.

Local authorities provide about 8,200 smallholdings in England and about
1,000 in Wales. In England about 750 lettable holdings are provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Minister and local
authorities may make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to
their smallholding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the Govern¬
ment, which owns and maintains about 163,000 hectares (403,000 acres) of
land settlement estates, comprising some 2,700 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (situated in Strathclyde, Highland,
Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands) much of the land is held
by crofters, tenants whose holdings are generally either rented at a cost of not
more than £100 a year or have an area not exceeding 30 hectares (75 acres).
Crofting is administered by the Crofters Commission, and benefits from
government grants for land improvement and some other agricultural
work.
A code of landlord-tenant relationships has been written into legislation in
order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and obligations. Rent is a matter for
negotiation between landlord and tenant and may be varied by agreement or,
failing agreement, by arbitration.
Most agricultural tenants have the right to contest a notice to quit, which
then becomes inoperative unless the landlord obtains consent to its operation
from an independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural Land
Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court).
On termination of tenancy, the tenant is entitled to compensation in accord¬
ance with a special code.
There are provisions for succession of a close relative on the death of a
tenant.
The Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive (see p 341) is
responsible for the enforcement of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974
and regulations relating to the health and safety of workers in agriculture. The
regulations cover such matters as the guarding of field and stationary machin¬
ery, work places, the fitting of safety cabs to tractors, and the use of chemicals.
Ten regional water authorities are responsible for land drainage (including
flood prevention) in England and Wales. Most of the funds needed by water
authorities are obtained from local authorities, but the Government pays
grants towards the cost of improvement schemes. In some low-lying
areas where there are special local problems of land drainage, internal
drainage boards carry out work for the special benefit and protection of their
districts. The boards finance their work from drainage rates levied on owners
and occupiers, and from government grants payable on improvement works.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants towards the cost of improvements.
In Scotland local authorities deal with coast protection and urban land flood
prevention, while arterial drainage and agricultural land flood prevention are
the owners’ responsibility. Grants are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land who carry out arterial drainage work.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage
authority.

The Agriculture Ministers are responsible for government policy on the
welfare of farm animals and livestock. It is an offence to cause unnecessary
pain or distress to animals on the farm, and regulations provide, for
example, for the daily inspection by the stock keeper of intensively farmed
livestock and the equipment upon which they depend and for the control of
certain operations such as the tail docking of cattle and pigs. Inspections by
members of the State Veterinary Service (part of the Agricultural Develop¬
ment and Advisory Service) are carried out to monitor compliance with welfare
provisions. Other regulations, enforced by local government authorities, make
it an offence to cause injury or unnecessary suffering to farm animals in transit
at markets.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council, set up in 1979, keeps under review
the welfare of farm animals and those in transit, in pens and at markets
and the place of slaughter, and advises the Agriculture Ministers in Great
Britain. One of the objectives of the Advisory Committee on Animal Experi¬
ments, also set up in 1979, is the protection of animals against avoidable
suffering.
Responsibility for the Government’s policy on animal health matters in Great
Britain rests with the agricultural departments. Professional advice and action
on the control of animal disease and the welfare of farm livestock is the
responsibility of the State Veterinary Service. The day-to-day work of treating
animal disease is the responsibility of the practising veterinary surgeon.
The Veterinary Service has extensive laboratory facilities, and there are 24
investigation centres in England and Wales, which perform work requiring
specialist knowledge and give advice on disease problems to private practition¬
ers. In Scotland the service is provided by three regional agricultural colleges.
Strict veterinary controls are exercised on the import of all animals, meat
and meat products, live poultry and other captive birds, and poultry meat, so
as to prevent the introduction of animal or poultry diseases.
Foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever have been eradicated by a slaughter
policy applied to all infected animals and those exposed to infection. Swine
vesicular disease is combated by a similar slaughter policy backed up by control
of pig movements and of swill feeding. Rigorous measures have been taken to
eradicate sheep scab which now appears to be under control. The incidence of
bovine tuberculosis is now very low; cattle (except for certain categories) are
tested at regular intervals, and reactors to the test are slaughtered; compensa¬
tion is paid to the owners. Compulsory eradication of brucellosis on an area
basis began in 1972. By March 1980 some 96 per cent of all herds in Great
Britain were declared free of the disease, many areas being completely free.
Newcastle disease (fowl pest) has declined to a low level because of a vaccina¬
tion policy. As a result of these measures, Great Britain is free from many
serious animal diseases. Non-farm animals are subject to import licence and six
months’ quarantine as a precaution against the introduction of rabies, and
there are severe penalties for those breaking the law. There has been no case of
rabies in Britain since 1970.
In Northern Ireland the legislation on the control of animal diseases is
administered by the Department of Agriculture, which has its own veterinary
service supplemented by a central veterinary laboratory. The Department’s
strict animal health control policies and the geographical situation have kept
Northern Ireland free from the major animal diseases, including rabies and
swine vesicular disease. A brucellosis eradication scheme has been successfully
carried out and in 1971 Northern Ireland was declared brucellosis-free.

The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Certification schemes are
operated to encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type
planting stocks. The Harpenden Laboratory in Hertfordshire, and the
Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East Craigs, Edinburgh, provide
advice on which these controls and schemes are based.
The central laboratories of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Ser¬
vice’s Agricultural Science Service and the Agricultural Scientific Services of
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland undertake research
and provide advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects, mites and
moulds associated with grain and other stored food products.
There are safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled
use of pesticides. Products must be cleared for safety under the Pesticides
Safety Precautions Scheme (see p 184), and may be submitted through the
Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme for efficacy approval.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the control
of the manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products. The
licences are issued by the Agriculture Ministers, who are advised on safety,
quality and efficacy by the Veterinary Products Committee. (For other pro¬
visions of the Act see p 137.)
An outline of the organisation of British agricultural research and develop¬
ment, including that carried out by the Agricultural Research Council and the
universities, is given in chapter 20. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food carries out research and development at its own laboratories and on the
21 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations operated by the
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, and commissions work from
the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Coun¬
cil and outside research organisations. The Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland carries out research and development at its own
laboratories, and commissions the work of eight independent research organ¬
isations; the Department also commissions research and development work
from the three colleges which provide the advisory service (see p 293). In
England and Wales, research in agricultural economics is undertaken by 12
university departments of agricultural economics. In Scotland, agricultural
economists are on the staff of the three regional agricultural colleges and the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. At the University of Reading in
England, the Centre for Agricultural Strategy provides an assessment of
British agriculture with a view to developing long-term strategies.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture has eight research
divisions concerned with the agricultural, veterinary and food sciences; their
staff also teach at Queen’s University, Belfast. Applied research also takes
place at the three agricultural colleges.
Sixteen British universities provide degree and postgraduate courses in
agriculture, horticulture, agricultural sciences or agricultural economics. The
National College of Agricultural Engineering at Silsoe, Bedfordshire offers

degree and postgraduate courses. Sandwich courses leading to a Higher
National Diploma are available at nine agricultural colleges in England and
Wales and there are about 50 local authority and other agricultural colleges
providing full-time and part-time courses on different aspects of agriculture,
horticulture and related subjects. A centre for European agricultural studies is
based at London University’s Wye College at Ashford, Kent.
In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which have the advisory and
development functions are also teaching establishments. They mainly provide
sandwich courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post¬
diploma courses and certain short courses, and are also associated with univer¬
sities in the provision of degree-level education.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time and part-
time courses for farmers, farm workers and horticulturists, as well as an
advisory service for domestic producers.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board provides a training
advisory service, organises training courses and pays training grants. In
Northern Ireland training courses are organised by the Department of
Agriculture. Degree and postgraduate courses in veterinary medicine are
provided at four universities in England and two universities in Scotland.
FISHERIES
With its long coastline and its maritime tradition, Britain is one of Europe’s
most important fishing nations. The fishing industry, which provides about 70
per cent of Britain’s fish supplies, constitutes a small but important part of the
national economy. Fishing is one of the main elements in the business of many
major ports, and forms the basis of many communities around the coast.
The industry catches demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea),
pelagic fish (caught nearer the surface) and shellfish. Demersal fish accounts
for about 44 per cent (by weight) of the total catch, pelagic fish for over 48 per
cent and shellfish for 8 per cent. The principal demersal fish (in terms of value)
are cod, haddock, plaice and whiting. The most important pelagic species is
mackerel. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters and crabs) and molluscs
(such as mussels and oysters).
Since 1977 Britain’s fishery limits have extended to 200 miles (or, where the
distance between two countries’ coasts is less than 400 miles, up to the line
half-way between the two countries). This followed the European Community
member States’ agreement to adopt such limits jointly, after similar exten¬
sions, with resulting restrictions on Community vessels, had been announced
by many maritime nations.
Community countries, and non-Community countries having temporary
agreements with the Community, have the right to fish up to Britain’s 12-mile
limit. Designated Community countries may also fish in certain areas of
Britain’s 6 to 12 mile zone. The only non-Community country which may fish
in this zone is Norway, which has very restricted rights in some areas off the
Scottish coast. No foreign vessels may fish within Britain’s 6-mile limit. All
fishing within British fishery limits is subject to British conservation measures.
The Community has negotiated exchanges of fishing rights within member
States’ waters for reciprocal rights within the waters of several non-member
countries. For 1980 reciprocal agreements were negotiated with Norway, the
Faroe Islands, Sweden and Spain and non-reciprocal agreements with

Canada, Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. Quotas were also established in United
States and international waters in the north-west Atlantic.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles, it became necessary to revise
the Community fisheries’ internal regime to allow for controlled Community
fishing in the greatly extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest in
such control, since about 60 per cent of the total catch within the new limits is
taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in distant waters
(such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry’s total catch more than that
of other Community States. As a result Britain is looking for adequate access
arrangements and a fair share of the quotas proposed for the fish stocks around
Britain’s coasts and in other countries’ waters. Community members aim to
reach agreement on a revised common fisheries policy by the end of 1980.
There is also a need for effective and enforceable conservation measures
within the waters of member States. The Government is continuing to work
towards a common fisheries policy which meets these needs. However, in the
absence of an agreed Community policy, it has introduced a number of
conservation measures where these have proved necessary. In September 1980
a series of measures on fish conservation was agreed by Community fisheries
ministers.
In January 1980 the Community reached agreement on total allowable
catches for 1980 and on the introduction of a system for recording and
reporting catches.
The Community’s fishing industry is also subject to a common organisation
of the market and to a common structural policy which has not yet been
fully developed. The organisation of the market aims at assisting in the
adaptation of supplies to marketing requirements, while ensuring, as far as
possible, a reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a
grading and price system, and rules on competition. Provision is also made for
the protection of the Community market against disruption by imports from
non-member countries. The responsibility for market organisation is placed
largely in the hands of the industry itself through producers’ organisations.
Intra-Community fish trade is tariff-free and there is a common external tariff.
The structural policy aims at promoting the rational development of the
fishing industry and at ensuring an equitable standard of living for those
dependent on fishing. In pursuit of these aims it envisages common measures
for financing structural improvement, but to date little progress has been made
towards agreeing these measures.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Brixham, Falmouth,
Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull, Lowestoft, Milford Haven, Newlyn, North Shields
and Plymouth. In Scotland the chief ports are Aberdeen, Ayr, Fraserburgh,
Lerwick, Mallaig, Peterhead, Stornaway and Ullapool. In Northern Ireland the
main fishing ports are Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie.
In 1979 there were some 16,600 fishermen in regular employment and about
5,300 occasionally employed; about 46 per cent of the former and 23 per cent of
the latter were based on Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland there are about
700 full-time fishermen and about 300 part-time. It is estimated that for every
fisherman there are between three and five jobs in associated trades.
Fishing is an important source of employment and income in certain areas,
in many of which unemployment is well above the national average. Mainten-

ance of fishing opportunities, through conservation of stocks and through the
preservation of British fishermen’s access to their traditional grounds, is thus
vital to Britain.
At the end of 1979 the deep-sea fleet comprised some 270 vessels; of these,
distant-water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull and Grimsby,
numbered 58. They are about 43 metres (140 feet) and over in length and
are of two types, the older, traditional side trawlers, which can only preserve
their catches on ice, and modern stern freezer/factory trawlers (31 in
number). Traditionally all have fished in the north-east Arctic and
still do within the constraints of quota agreements which have reduced activity.
Some side trawlers have been diverted to home waters hitherto fished by
smaller vessels. Stern trawlers also fish the north-east Arctic but have recently
been successful in mackerel fishing, mainly off south-west England. Middle-
water trawlers between about 34 and 43 metres in length (110-140 feet) have
also had to diversify their activity into northern North Sea grounds consequent
upon reduced quota allocations off the Faroes. The inshore group consists of
some 2,000 vessels of over 12 metres (40 feet) and about 5,000 smaller vessels.
In 1979, landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 838,000 tonnes valued at £254 million. Cod accounted
for 29 per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed haddock
(17 per cent), mackerel (17 per cent), and plaice (8 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Increasing attention is being paid to fish and shellfish farming and the
farming of some species of sea fish is being developed.
Experiments are being carried out in the catching and processing, for human
consumption and fish meal (for animal feed), of previously under-exploited
species of fish (for example, blue whiting and horse mackerel) of which large
stocks are known to exist in the sea adjacent to the British Isles.
In 1980, the Government provided over £1-4 million to help to finance
exploratory voyages aimed at assessing the commercial potential of under¬
exploited fish stocks and methods of fishing.
Home production of fish meal in 1979 was about 50,000 tonnes. Fish oil
production was about 10,000 tonnes.
Imports of all fresh, frozen, cured and canned fish and shellfish totalled
311,000 tonnes valued at £318 million. Imports of fish meal amounted to
255»000 tonnes, worth £55 million, and those of fish oils to 215,000 tonnes,
worth £48 million. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products amounted
to 442,000 tonnes and were valued at just under £152 million.
Total fish consumption was running at a level of approximately 6-7 kg a head
in 1979. Home production provided about 70 per cent of supplies.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside the 12-mile
zone. Within the zone, drift netting and certain other methods are prohibited
off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, salmon fishing is a private right. In
England and Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and
estuary netting. The landed value of the salmon catch in 1979 was approxi¬
mately £2 million in England and Wales, about £5-3 million in Scotland, and
some £419,000 in Northern Ireland. Eels worth about £1-5 million were caught
in Northern Ireland.

Fish is distributed through wholesalers located at the ports, who buy fish at
quayside auctions and sell to inland wholesalers or retailers, and through
processors who also buy at auctions and sometimes under contract arrange¬
ments with the owners of fishing vessels, particularly for fish frozen at sea.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research are the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh Office Agriculture Department and the
Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and welfare of
crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping generally are
provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by the Depart¬
ment of Trade.
The White Fish Authority administers grant and loan schemes providing
financial assistance to the white fish industry. Financial aid is available for the
purchase of new fishing vessels, vessel improvements, the provision and
improvement of processing plants, cold stores and ice plants and towards the
formation of fishermen’s co-operatives. The Authority’s other functions
include research and development, training, dissemination of information,
publicity and promotion and the provision of consultancy services including
those to developing countries. The Herring Industry Board administers simi¬
lar grant and loan schemes providing assistance for the industry towards the
purchase of new, and the improvement of existing, vessels. The Authority and
the Board have a joint administration. It is proposed that the two bodies be
replaced by a single one.
The Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland operates grant and
loan schemes for the purchasing of new fishing vessels and engines and the
improvement of existing vessels, and for processors, co-operatives and fish
farmers.
In 1980, because of increased operating costs, falling prices and the absence
of an agreed Community common fisheries policy, the Government gave £33
million in aid to the fishing industry.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Britain is 2-1 million hectares (5-2
million acres), or about 9 per cent of the total land area; 43 per cent of the area
is in England, 43 per cent in Scotland, 11 per cent in Wales and the remainder
in Northern Ireland.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain managed by the Forestry
Commission, at 884,000 hectares (2-2 million acres), constitutes 51 per cent of
this category. The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently
11,800 hectares (29,150 acres) by the Commission mainly in Scotland, and
some 8,100 hectares (20,000 acres) by private woodland owners. The Com¬
mission’s programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, and
consists mainly of conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at 19,000 in 1979.
Except for the periods of the two world wars, when felling was abnormally
heavy, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as less than half

of the Commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports 91 per
cent of its needs, the total import cost of wood and wood products, including
pulp and paper, being over £2,800 million in 1979. Roundwood removals in
1979 amounted to 4 million cubic metres.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and
the production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The Commissioners
comply with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has its own separate organisa¬
tion (see below). In pursuing its main objective, timber production, Great
Britain’s forestry policy also takes into account amenity, environmental and
employment criteria. Thus the Commission’s activities include wildlife
conservation, the landscaping of plantations, and the provision of facilities for
recreation. The Commission has also encouraged the setting up of some 20
major new timber-using industries.
The Forestry Commission is financed partly by the State and partly by receipts
from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. Income from timber is
expected to increase as production doubles in the next 20 years, probably
leading to a reduction in its grant-in-aid.
Privately owned woods comprise 56 per cent of the total forest area in Great
Britain. About half of the private woodland area is in ownerships of under 100
hectares (250 acres) in extent.
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the pro¬
vision of grants administered by the Forestry Commission, in return for which
owners accept a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in accord¬
ance with sound forestry practice.
Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at three univer¬
sities and there are supervisory, craft and managerial level courses.
The Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists
the development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in the
state and private sectors.
The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with
training for private-sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission, universities
and other institutions.
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland.
The Department may acquire land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. It has introduced measures to control
felling, fires near plantations and damage by certain animals. Financial pro¬
vision is made annually by Parliament.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. By 1980 70,000 hectares (168,000 acres) of plantable land had been
acquired, of which 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) were planted. There were
about 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of privately owned forest.
Some 1,200 people worked in state and private forests in 1980; of these,
about 600 were employed under the Urban and Rural Improvement Campaign
for developing recreational facilities, mostly in state forests.
ROADS
16 Transport and
Communications
The application of technological developments to Britain’s transport and
communications network is helping to make travel quicker and more con¬
venient. Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight have
resulted from the construction of a network of motorways, the extension of
fast inter-city rail services (such as those operated by high speed trains),
the modernisation of many ports, the increased use of containers and other
modern methods in shipping, the use by airlines of larger or speedier air¬
craft (such as the Concorde supersonic aircraft) and expansion schemes at
many airports.
Transport and communications contribute 8 per cent of gross national
product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of gross domestic
fixed capital formation. They employed some 1-5 million people in Great
Britain in December 1979 and accounted for 7 per cent of the employed labour
force. Of these, 205,300 employees were engaged in road passenger transport,
221,000 in road haulage, 204,400 in railways, 429,000 in postal services and
telecommunications, 148,500 in sea transport, port and inland water trans¬
port, 91,300 in air transport and 173,100 in other transport services and
storage.
INLAND TRANSPORT
Passenger and freight traffic is carried mainly by road. At the end of 1979 there
were 18-6 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great Britain, 3-9 per
cent more than a year earlier. Of these 14-6 million were motor cars, 1 -8 million
road goods vehicles, 1-3 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds, and
in,000 public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of
cars has been growing rapidly for many years and the car is the most popular
form of travel. Buses and coaches account for about 11 per cent of passenger
mileage within Great Britain, rail for 7 per cent and air 0-5 per cent. Road
haulage has a dominant position in the movement of inland freight, accounting
for about 85 per cent of tonnage carried and for some three-quarters of
tonne-kilometres. Railways and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. The railways and much of the bus industry are publicly owned, but
road haulage is almost entirely in the hands of private enterprise.
Transport policy rests on the fundamental aims of helping economic growth
and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of personal
mobility, while improving safety, particularly on the roads, minimising dam¬
age to the environment and taking account of energy considerations. Britain is
taking an active part in the development of a common transport policy by the
European Community.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain rose in 1979 by o-6 per cent to a record
275,800 million vehicle-kilometres, of which cars and taxis accounted for 80
per cent. Improvements are continually being made in the network of trunk
Bridges and
Tunnels
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 303
roads (which form a basic network linking major centres of population, indus¬
trial areas and ports) to accommodate the growth in traffic. A number of
motorways (roads specially designed for high speed traffic) have been built,
while other improvements, such as the construction of by-passes, have helped
to make travelling easier and faster, particularly over long distances and
between cities. Congestion on inter-urban roads has been reduced or eliminated
and many towns and villages have been relieved of heavy through traffic.
Although motorways account for less than i per cent of road mileage, they
carry 10 per cent of traffic including over one-fifth of heavy goods vehicle
traffic. In 1979 the road network totalled 224,567 miles (361,406 kilometres),
of which some 1,611 miles (2,593 kilometres) were motorways. Motorways
and other major roads are shown on the map at the end of the book.

c In addition, there were 61 miles (98 kilometres) of local authority motorway in use in England
and 13 miles (21 kilometres) in Scotland.
The main aims of the Government’s programme to improve trunk roads are
to meet the needs of industry and to keep heavy lorry traffic away from towns
and villages. In England the main priorities are the M25 London orbital route
and certain routes to serve industry and the major ports. In Wales the priorities
are to complete the M4 motorway across south Wales, reconstruct the coast
road in north Wales and improve roads which are important for industrial
redevelopment. Most of the remaining links in the motorway/dual carriageway
network in central Scotland have been completed. Accordingly, the pro¬
gramme is being directed mainly to the improvement of other strategic routes,
particularly those in the north and north-east which are important for North
Sea oil-related activities and some of the west-coast routes. In Northern
Ireland the emphasis is on building new links to the motorway network,
constructing more by-passes, and improving roads in the Belfast area and other
urban areas. Priority for new roads in urban areas of Great Britain is being
given to those designed to meet the needs of industry and commerce, serve new
industrial or housing estates, provide links to the national trunk road network
or to complement traffic management schemes.
The suspension bridges across the Firth of Forth and the Severn Estuary,
completed in the mid-1960s, both incorporated major advances in suspension
bridge design. Their main spans are among the longest suspension bridge
spans, but the bridge being built across the river Humber and due to be opened
early in 1981 will have a span of 1,410 metres (4,626 feet), longer than any

existing bridge span in the world. Other major bridges planned include a
second bridge across the river Foyle at Londonderry, which is due to be
completed by the end of 1983, and a bridge to carry the Ipswich by-pass across
the river Orwell.
A few road tunnels have been built to cross major estuaries, notably the
Mersey, the Thames, the Tyne and the Clyde. A second crossing of the
Thames at Dartford (Kent) was opened in May 1980.
Administration Responsibility for trunk motorways and other trunk roads in Great Britain
rests in England with the Minister of Transport, in Scotland with the Secretary
of State for Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales. The
costs of construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
Government. Work on major trunk road and motorway schemes in England is
controlled by regional road construction units which include staff from the
Department of Transport and county councils. The highway authority for
non-trunk roads in England and Wales is, in general, the county council in
whose area the roads lie, and in Scotland the regional or islands council. The
Government is in the process of transferring to local authorities the responsi¬
bility for those trunk roads which have lost their importance as major through
routes following the completion of nearby motorways.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for public roads and their maintenance and construction.
Road Safety Great Britain’s accident record is considerably better than that of most other
countries even though it has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the
world. In 1979, 6,300 people were killed on the roads, about 80,300 seriously
injured and 247,100 slightly injured. A comprehensive framework of legisla¬
tion embodied in the Road Traffic Acts and summarised in the Highway Code
(which sets out the standard of conduct for road users) has contributed to the
decline in casualty rates. Other factors have been modern roads, designed for
present-day traffic and segregating vehicles from pedestrians, and campaigns
conducted nationally by government departments and the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents and locally by local authorities to persuade people
to take greater care on the roads. In recent years major publicity campaigns
have been undertaken to increase the wearing of seat belts, to reduce casualties
to child pedestrians and to riders of motor cycles, and to reduce the incidence
of drinking and driving.
Comprehensive regulations govern the design of vehicles, their use on the
roads, and the maintenance of their mechanical condition. Under a national
‘type approval’ scheme, all new cars must be of a type that has been certified as
meeting the required standards. In Great Britain private cars and light vans
which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private garages
authorised as test stations. (In Northern Ireland private cars seven or more
years old are tested at official vehicle inspection centres.) Heavy goods vehicles
are tested annually at government test stations. Public service vehicles must be
specially approved before being licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at
regular intervals. Any vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time by the
police and examined.
Minimum ages are laid down for driving: 16 for driving invalid carriages and
mopeds; 17 for cars and other passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), motorcycles and goods vehicles not over 3-5
tonnes maximum permissible weight; 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not
over 7-5 tonnes; and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats and goods

vehicles over 7-5 tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles are required to pass the
driving test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test
they must hold a ‘provisional’ licence, display ‘L’ (learner) plates on their
vehicle and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a
qualified driver. In Northern Ireland a driver having passed the test is required
to display an ‘R’ (restricted) plate for a one-year period during which he must
not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). There are schemes for special licensing and
testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles.
Speed limits also contribute to road safety. There are national limits of
70 mph (113 km/h) on motorways and other dual carriageway roads, and
60 mph (97 km/h) on single carriageway roads, while in built-up areas a general
limit of 30 mph (48 km/h) applies. To meet local needs the urban limit can be
raised and the other limits lowered on specific stretches of road. A wide range
of other measures directed primarily towards road safety include legislation
and publicity to discourage drinking and driving (including a maximum
permissible blood alcohol level for drivers of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100
millilitres of blood), computer-controlled warning signals on most busy
motorways to inform motorists of advisory speed limits in adverse conditions
and of lane closures, and regulations governing the carriage of dangerous goods
by road. The Government is proceeding with new measures designed to
improve the safety of motorcycle riders and strengthen the law on drinking and
driving. It has also undertaken a review of traffic law to consider the merits of
replacing the totting-up procedure for driving offences by a points system
varying according to the severity of the offence, and of extending and improv¬
ing the fixed penalty system for minor traffic offences with the aim of reducing
the burden on the police and the courts.
Traffic in the centres of cities and towns in Britain is being managed so as to
minimise congestion and its environmental effects, and to improve road safety.
Local authorities have powers to introduce a range of measures which, when
combined, form comprehensive traffic management schemes covering a par¬
ticular area. Such schemes may include one-way systems, streets reserved for
pedestrians, bus priority measures, parking controls and limited road con¬
struction. In most town centres parking is restricted and waiting limits apply.
Major city centres often have controlled parking zones, where payment is
required for on-street parking.
Several cities have new shopping precincts, some of them enclosed, which
are specially designed for pedestrians and from which motor vehicles are
excluded. In the centres of many towns, areas containing several streets have
been wholly or partly converted to pedestrian use, and this has resulted in a
more attractive environment.
Urban traffic control systems, which link traffic signals and some traffic
signs to a central computer, represent an important addition to local
authorities’ ability to control traffic. A new method for large towns and cities of
continuously adapting traffic signal response to the flow of traffic is being
tested in Coventry, while a compact form of urban traffic control, sponsored
by the Department of Transport and suitable for use in much smaller towns, is
operating in Torbay and Hull.
Research into all aspects of road construction, traffic engineering and safety,
and into problems associated with transport is carried out by the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), jointly responsible to the Department of
Transport and the Department of the Environment. The TRRL provides

including their interaction with urban and regional planning. It employs
nearly 850 people of whom about half are scientists and engineers.
Road haulage traffic in terms of tonne-kilometres has increased substantially
and reached a record 104,600 million tonne-kilometres in 1979. Actual goods
vehicle traffic has, however, grown much less because of a move towards larger
and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier loads—over three-fifths of the
traffic, in terms of tonne-kilometres, is carried in vehicles of over 28 tonnes
gross laden weight. Much of the traffic is moved over short distances, with
more than three-fifths of the tonnage being carried on hauls of 50 kilometres
(31 miles) or less. Public haulage (private road hauliers carrying other firms’
goods) accounts for 61 per cent of freight carried in Great Britain in terms of
tonne-kilometres. The growth in road haulage has been concentrated on
long-distance traffic, particularly international road haulage, and British
hauliers are increasingly running goods vehicles to the rest of Europe. An
independent inquiry, set up by the Minister of Transport, has been consider¬
ing the growth in road haulage, especially its impact on people and the
environment, and the best way of ensuring that future developments meet the
public interest.
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small, privately owned busi¬
nesses. Many of the 125,500 holders of an operator’s licence in 1979 had only
one vehicle and the average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. The biggest
operator in Great Britain is the National Freight Corporation (NFC). Turn¬
over of the NFC’s freight transport subsidiaries amounted to £417 million in
1979 and at the end of 1979 it owned or leased 18,400 vehicles, 11,200
additional trailers and 5,100 containers and demountable bodies. Under the
Transport Act 1980 the status of the NFC has been changed from a publicly
owned company into a company with shares. The Government intends to offer
a majority of shares for sale to private investors. In Northern Ireland the
biggest operator is Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd, owned jointly by the
Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and the NFC.
Those operating goods vehicles of over 3-5 tonnes gross weight (with certain
special exemptions) require an operator’s licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and
drivers’ hours. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms carrying
their own goods and standard licences, sub-divided into ‘national only’ and
‘international’, for hauliers operating for hire or reward. Proof of professional
competence is required to obtain a standard licence.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the
carriage of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by
drivers of goods vehicles, and there are also minimum rest periods. The
European Community regulation requiring the use of the tachograph (a device
which automatically records a vehicle’s speed and distance covered, driving
time and stopping periods) in most goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross weight
in Great Britain is due to be phased in by December 1981. International road
haulage is governed mainly by bilateral agreements, which are in force with 25
other European countries. These allow British road hauliers to carry goods to
or through these countries. In some cases permits are required and these are
usually limited to a quota negotiated annually. The demand for permits by

British road hauliers has been growing rapidly and for 1980 the Government
negotiated substantial increases in the quotas with many countries.
Bus and urban railway services in Britain are provided mainly by publicly
owned operators, coach services partly by publicly owned bodies, and taxis and
hire cars almost entirely by privately owned businesses.
In the public sector in Great Britain 22,000 vehicles are operated by the
National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the
seven passenger transport executives (responsible for the day-to-day manage¬
ment and operations of local transport in Greater Glasgow and the metropoli¬
tan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Tyne and
Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire), 6,500 by the London Transport
Executive and 6,000 by other local authority undertakings. There are some
5,600 privately owned undertakings (of which the majority have fewer than
five vehicles) comprising about 28,500 vehicles; only a small proportion of
these operators are concerned with scheduled bus services. Double-deck buses
are an important feature of urban passenger transport in Britain and there are
nearly 27,000 in operation. In addition, there are 47,000 single-deck buses and
coaches, and nearly 100 trams (at Blackpool and Llandudno which have
Britain’s only remaining tramway systems).
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries, such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Kibble
Motor Services Ltd and Crosville Motor Services Ltd, and has a network of
long-distance coach services. At the end of 1979 it owned some 17,500 vehicles
and employed 63,400 people. In 1979 passenger journeys on the Company’s
buses amounted to 1,778 million, gross revenue was £498 million and the
Company had a net surplus of £6-2 million.
The Scottish Transport Group (with about 3,800 vehicles) operates the
main bus services in Scotland outside the major cities and also runs ferries to
the islands off the west coast of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of
the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 400 and
1,050 vehicles respectively.
There has been a long-term decline in the use of bus and coach services (except
in the area of contract and private hire), due primarily to the growth in
ownership of private cars, and in 1978 some 7,305 million passenger road
journeys were made in Great Britain, 29 per cent fewer than in 1968. Bus
operators have taken action to contain costs and to improve productivity by
introducing larger buses, increasing the proportion of bus services operated by
one man and reducing or rationalising services. Many uneconomic bus services
have been withdrawn, particularly in the rural areas. However, in some rural
areas new ‘postbus’ services (Post Office minibuses carrying mail and passen¬
gers) or community-run minibus services have been introduced.
The Transport Act 1980 contains the biggest series of reforms in road
passenger transport for 50 years and one of its aims is the encouragement of
new types of service, especially in rural areas. It provides for fundamental
changes in the road services licensing system, under which traffic commis¬
sioners are responsible for licensing public road passenger services. There are
11 traffic areas in Great Britain, each under the jurisdiction of an independent

body of three commissioners. The Act provides for the removal of restrictions
on operating long-distance express coach services and on excursions and tours,
allowing free competition between operators. For those local services which
remain subject to the commissioners’ jurisdiction, the commissioners now
grant an application for a licence unless satisfied that to do so would be against
the public interest, thus making it easier for a new operator to start services.
Restrictions on advertising car-sharing schemes have also been removed. Local
authorities have been given the power to carry fare-paying adults on school
buses where there is spare capacity. The Minister of Transport intends to
designate a number of trial areas where no road service licences will be required
and a minimum of restrictions will apply. A new system of safety and quality
control will come into force early in 1981 involving the replacement of the
present system of licensing each public service vehicle by a system of operator
licensing, which will be administered by the traffic commissioners.
There are about 37,000 taxicabs in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas,
especially London where some 12,500 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets
are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually
by the Metropolitan Police. There are about 17,000 licensed cab drivers in
London. Numerous car-hire firms are also in operation. Elsewhere taxis are
licensed by local authorities. In Northern Ireland all taxis are licensed by the
Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
There are underground railway services in three British cities: London, Glas¬
gow and Liverpool. London Transport has 4,228 railway cars and serves 279
stations, while its trains operate over 260 miles (418 kilometres) of railway, of
which about 100 miles (161 kilometres) are underground.
Urban rail projects are proceeding in several areas. A light rapid transit
system under construction on Tyneside involves the electrification of two
suburban railway lines, linked by new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne
and Gateshead, and a new bridge over the Tyne. The first section was opened
in August 1980 and the remainder of the system, which will eventually be 34
miles (55 kilometres) long with over 40 stations, will be brought into
operation during the 1980s. The project is the largest provincial urban trans¬
port scheme to have been undertaken in Britain in the twentieth century. In
Glasgow, as part of the ‘Trans-Clyde’ integrated public transport system, the
Underground has been completely modernised and was reopened in April
1980, and a new rail link, the Argyle line, has been built. Recent additions to
the London Underground were the extension of the Piccadilly line to Heath¬
row Airport in 1977, enabling passengers to travel directly between Heathrow
and central London by the Underground; and the opening in 1979 of the
Jubilee line, linking north-west and central London.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be
worked by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway
companies in Great Britain were brought under public ownership and in 1963
the British Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary
activities. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd,
a subsidiary of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates
the railway service on 200 miles (322 kilometres) of track.
A high rate of progress in railway development has been maintained
in recent years, notably on the inter-city passenger network where the

introduction of faster trains, together with the raising of standards of track and
signalling, has brought significant reductions in journey time on many routes.
Inter-city rail services in Great Britain are among the best in the world in
speed, frequency and comfort. Two major projects, the High Speed Train
(HST) and the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), have been designed to raise
speeds using existing track. A continuing important role is envisaged for the
railways in Britain’s transport system, especially in the provision of long¬
distance passenger transport, commuter services and essential local services,
and in the movement of bulk freight.
British Rail’s operating statistics are shown in Table 24. In 1979 the Board’s
turnover, including financial support and income from other activities but
excluding internal transactions, was £2,306 million. It achieved a trading
surplus of £62-3 million, although there was a net deficit of £0-4 million.
Financial support for British Rail includes compensation for the financial
burden of operating the rail passenger system as a public service and grants for
level crossings. In 1979 the British Railways Board received £530 million from
the Government and the passenger transport executives in respect of the public
service obligation. At the end of 1979 the British Railways Board employed
244,100 people, of whom 182,000 were engaged on the railways.

The passenger network (see map, p 310) comprises a fast inter-city network,
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local stopping services; and com¬
muter services in and around the large conurbations, especially London and
south-east England. British Rail introduced the world’s fastest diesel rail
service, known as Inter-City 125 and operated by HSTs travelling at maxi¬
mum sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h), in 1976 on the route from
London to Bristol and south Wales. Similar services were introduced on the
London-Edinburgh route in 1978 and on the London-Plymouth-Penzance
route in 1979. HSTs are due to enter service in 1981-82 on the route linking
Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham and south-west England or
south Wales. The first of three pre-production electric APTs, capable of
sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h) over longer stretches than the HSTs,
will be introduced on the London—Glasgow route later in 1980 covering the
400-mile (644-kilometre) journey in 4 hours 10 minutes. British Rail is propos¬
ing to order a further 50 to 60 APTs for services between London, Birming¬
ham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.

to be completed in 1982, to electrify the line between London and Bedford. A
review of the case for a programme of further main-line electrification is being
conducted by the Government and the British Railways Board.
Passenger-mileage in 1979 was the highest since 1961 (when the rail network
was 30 per cent larger), reflecting the extension of high-speed services and the
wider range of promotional fares designed to encourage greater use of trains.
The most important freight commodities handled in 1979 were coal and coke
(93-5 million tonnes) and iron and steel (25-1 million tonnes). British Rail is
concentrating on traffic particularly suitable for carriage by rail, especially
long-distance and bulk trainload traffic.
Increased efficiency is being obtained as new types of wagon are introduced
with larger capacities and which are capable of higher speeds. A network of
‘Speedlink’ high-speed freight services using these new wagons is being estab¬
lished between the major industrial centres. In mid-1980 there were 48 Speed-
link trains running each day and the number will be increased to about 100 by
1982. Freight traffic is being concentrated at fewer and better equipped and
sited marshalling yards and terminals. A computer-based total operations
processing system, which monitors all consignments and freight train and
wagon movements in Great Britain, has reduced costs by allowing the more
intensive use of rolling stock and the withdrawal of many obsolete wagons.
To encourage the use of railways for the carriage of freight, grants of 50 per
cent are available towards the cost of construction or modernisation of
privately owned rail freight facilities where this leads to significant
environmental benefits by the removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the
roads. By June 1980, 85 projects had been approved for grants totalling some
£22-5 million.
British Rail has a group of other companies, of which British Rail Engineering
Ltd (BREL) has the largest number of employees, about 36,200 at 13 engineer¬
ing plants. BREL mainly constructs locomotives, coaches, wagons and con¬
tainers for British Rail, and undertakes heavy maintenance and overhauls. It
also carries out work for export. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the
largest in the world; its most important achievement has been the development
of the APT. Transmark provides consultancy services overseas on railway and
associated operations. British Transport Hotels Ltd runs 29 hotels and con¬
trols Travellers-Fare, which is responsible for catering facilities at stations and
on trains, and provides meals and snacks on more trains than any other railway
company in Europe. British Rail also has various other activities including
shipping and hovercraft (see p 315), ports (see p 312) and property. The
British Railways Board proposes to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary
company to hold the assets and shares of the main non-railway subsidiaries and
to be responsible for introducing private capital into the individual businesses
by the most appropriate means.
Several proposals have been put forward for a fixed link across the English
Channel between Britain and France. The British Railways Board and Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Per Frangais (SNCF) have submitted a project,
costing some £650 million, for a single-track rail-only tunnel and this is being
considered by the Government.
There are a number of small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in
Great Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited

services for tourists and railway enthusiasts; the principal aim of many of these
railways is the preservation of steam traction. Most are standard gauge rail¬
ways, but some which run mostly on British Rail track, mainly in Wales, are
narrow gauge railways.
Inland waterways are popular for recreation (see p 430), continue to carry
freight and are important for land drainage and water supply. Of the 2,000
miles (3,219 kilometres) of canal and river navigations controlled by the
publicly owned British Waterways Board, some 340 miles (547 kilometres) are
maintained as commercial waterways for use by freight-carrying vessels.
Freight traffic carried on the Board’s waterways amounted to 84 million
tonne-kilometres in 1979 and the tonnage carried was 5-2 million tonnes. In
addition, some freight is carried on about 600 miles (966 kilometres) of inland
waterways owned by other bodies. The Board also operates docks, warehouses
and inland freight terminals, and has two barge fleets, although most of the
traffic on its waterways is conveyed by independent carriers. In 1979 the
Board’s turnover amounted to j£i3-i million, and it received government
grants of £21-4 million, most of which were used to maintain its waterways to
statutory standards. Completion of the Board’s £14-2 million scheme to
improve the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation between Doncaster
and Rotherham is expected in 1983. Improvements so far have already led to
increased traffic on the canal and, when completed, the improvements will
raise the barge capacity above Doncaster from 90 tonnes with the result that
700-tonne barges will be able to navigate as far as Mexborough and 400-tonne
barges to reach Rotherham.
PORTS
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in operations such as stevedoring,
towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four main types:
nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory companies.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a fifth of total
capacity, the majority, including Southampton, Hull, Grimsby/Immingham,
Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks
Board (Britain’s largest port authority). In 1979 shipping arrivals and depar¬
tures at the Board’s docks totalled 141 -4 million net registered tons (including
fishing vessels) and total cargo handled was 82-2 million tonnes. The Board’s
revenue totalled £133-6 million, over one-quarter of revenue earned by British
ports, and it achieved a net pre-tax profit of £13-6 million. Capital expenditure
amounted to £13-3 million. The Government is considering ways of introduc¬
ing private capital into the Board’s operations. The British Railways Board
controls certain ports, including Fishguard, Folkestone, Holyhead, Parkeston
Quay (Harwich) and Stranraer, which are largely used for its shipping ser¬
vices, while the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester) and
Weston Point in Runcorn. Major ports controlled by public trusts include
London, Milford Haven, Tees and Hartlepool, Medway, Forth and Clyde.
Local authorities own about one-third of Britain’s ports, including Bristol and
the new oil ports in Orkney and Shetland. Port undertakings owned by
statutory companies include Manchester and Liverpool. Many private ports
deal with the traffic of individual industrial firms in commodities such as china
clay and petroleum.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and respon-

sibilities set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port
authorities in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
Traffic through the ports of Great Britain rose by 8-8 per cent in 1979 to a
record 384 million tonnes comprising 157 million tonnes of imports, 108
million tonnes of exports and 120 million tonnes of coastal traffic (mostly
petroleum and coal). About 66 per cent of the traffic was in fuels, mainly
petroleum and petroleum products, which rose by 10 per cent in 1979 reflect¬
ing growing oil exports.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total tonnage handled, are given in Table 25.
Offshore oil developments have had a substantial effect on port traffic by
greatly increasing the flow through certain North Sea ports, such as Tees and
Hartlepool and the Forth ports, creating new oil ports at Flotta in Orkney and
Sullom Voe in Shetland, and reducing oil traffic at traditional oil importing
terminals such as Milford Haven and the Clyde. There has also been a switch in
general cargo traffic from some of the traditional ports, such as London,
Liverpool and Manchester, to smaller ports including Dover, Felixstowe and
Harwich, partly because of the growth of container and roll-on traffic. While
non-fuel traffic has been growing only slowly, container and roll-on traffic has
trebled since 1970 to 41 -7 million tonnes in 1979 and now accounts for almost
one-third of non-fuel traffic. The leading ports for this type of traffic are
Dover, Felixstowe, Southampton, London and Liverpool.

Modernisation of Britain’s ports is in progress, primarily to accommodate the
increase in the proportion of goods carried in container ships and roll-on
vessels, and the changing nature and direction of Britain’s trade. Most current
developments are concerned with specific energy or industrial needs or to
accommodate specialised container or roll-on services rather than with general
purpose port facilities.
Major schemes completed in the last few years have included a £24 million
container terminal, the world’s largest terminal for refrigerated containers, at
Tilbury (London); a terminal for handling iron ore and coal at Hunterston on
the Clyde which can accommodate ships up to 350,000 deadweight tons and is
the biggest of its type in Europe; the £37 million Royal Portbury Dock at
Bristol, containing six berths and the largest entrance lock in Britain; and one

of the world’s biggest hoverports, a £12 million terminal at Dover to handle
cross-Channel hovercraft. Major projects under construction or planned
include a £27 million scheme to provide two deep-water container berths at
Felixstowe, and a £12 million scheme for two roll-on berths, with multi-level
access, at Dover, which will handle the most modern cross-Channel ferries.
Work on a £20 million development scheme at Belfast, to provide two new unit
load terminals, is expected to begin in 1981.
The first purpose-built terminal for oil from the British sector of the North
Sea was completed at Hound Point on the Forth in 1975 and other terminals
have been built on the Tees, at Flotta and Sullom Voe. Sullom Voe is expected
to become the largest oil port in Europe in the early 1980s. Of the four jetties
completed, three are able to handle oil tankers of up to 300,000 deadweight
tons. With the growth of the offshore oil and gas industry, facilities for
handling products for the petrochemical industry are planned. A natural gas
liquids terminal is being built in the Firth of Forth and other major develop¬
ments are being considered. Other developments related to offshore oil and gas
include the construction of supply bases for offshore vessels at a number of
ports mostly on the east coast; those include Great Yarmouth, Leith, Dundee,
Montrose, Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Lerwick in Shetland.
SHIPPING
The British merchant fleet in mid-1979 at 28 million gross tons1 (45 •! million
deadweight tons) was the fourth largest after those of Liberia, Japan and
Greece. The oil tanker fleet (13’3 million gross tons) was the third largest and
the fleet of fully cellular container ships (1 -8 million gross tons) was the largest,
accounting for 18 per cent of the tonnage of vessels of this type. The fleet
reached its peak of 33-2 million gross tons in 1975, but has declined since then,
mainly owing to the world recession in shipping and increasing international
competition, especially from ships operating under ‘flags of convenience’. A
large tonnage of ships, particularly of tankers, has been scrapped or sold.
Nevertheless, the British fleet is still modern and technically advanced. About
four-fifths of the fleet is less than ten years old compared with two-thirds of the
world fleet.
In July 1979, 39‘3 million deadweight tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain. (This figure excludes
non-trading vessels, such as fishing vessels, tugs and dredgers, and shipping
registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries, which are
included in the figure of 45-1 million deadweight tons.) These ships were
usually employed as follows: 23-1 million deadweight tons as tankers; n-6
million deadweight tons as tramps and 4-6 million deadweight tons as cargo or
passenger liners.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping surveys and classifies ships with particular
regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned. Over half of
the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies, although there are a few indepen¬
dent tanker operators. British liner tonnage is dominated by a relatively small
number of large groups, the largest liner company being the Peninsular and
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton = 1 tonne (1,000
kilogrammes or 2,2051b). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed space on a
ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before submerging
the load-line.

Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P & O). Some shipowners have dele¬
gated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management companies.
Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly where heavy
investment is required, as with container and bulk cargo vessels. Chartering of
ships of all nationalities takes place on the Baltic Exchange, the largest market
of its type in the world. The representative body for shipowners (excluding
owners of fishing vessels) is the General Council of British Shipping.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, about three-quarters by value,
is carried by sea, while the proportion of passengers travelling to or from
Britain by sea is about one-third, compared with about one-half in the early
1960s.
In 1979 British seaborne trade amounted to 253 million tonnes (valued at
£69,586 million) or 851,617 million tonne-miles (1-4 million million tonne-
kilometres). Ships registered in Britain carried 29 per cent by weight, 25 per
cent in terms of tonne-miles and 41 per cent by value. Tanker cargoes
accounted for nearly half this trade by weight, but only about 13 per cent by
value, and foodstuffs and manufactured goods accounted for over three-
quarters by value.
Container and roll-on/roll-off vessels are responsible for a growing pro¬
portion of general cargo trade. Many of the deep-sea liner services from Britain
are operated by container ships. Roll-on services, accommodating passengers
and their cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles are increasing in
number, particularly between Britain and the continent of Europe. Several
freight-only roll-on services operate to the Irish Republic, the continent of
Europe, and to more distant countries, especially in the Middle East, North
Africa and West Africa.
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with
each other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same
routes in a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and
stability of rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The
essential principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of
freight rates to be applied by each member line. There are about 100 confer¬
ences dealing with trade to and from Britain.
In 1979 some 21-3 million passengers arrived at or departed from British ports.
Nearly all of these travelled to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish
Republic, services on other routes having been withdrawn as a result of the
growth of air services. Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for
cruising and in 1979 some 89,000 passengers embarked on pleasure cruises
from British ports. Services from British ports are shown on the map at the end
of the book.
Cross-Channel traffic accounts for a substantial proportion of traffic to the
continent of Europe. Sealink UK Ltd, a subsidiary of the British Railways
Board, is the largest short-sea ferry operator in Europe. The company and its
continental partners (SNCF of France, Regie des Transports Maritimes
Beiges and Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland of the Netherlands) operate
about 60 ships on short-sea routes. Sealink UK Ltd and the other major British
operators, including Townsend Thoresen and P & O’s Normandy Ferries, are
or have been investing heavily in new ships, resulting in a substantial increase
in cross-Channel ferry capacity.
There are two operators providing cross-Channel hovercraft services:

Seaspeed (run by British Rail Hovercraft Ltd in conjunction with SNCF) with
routes between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais; and Hoverlloyd
Ltd between Ramsgate and Calais. A hovercraft crossing takes about one-third
of the time taken by ships and hovercraft carry over one-quarter of the traffic
on the short-sea crossings to the continent of Europe. Seaspeed operates the
world’s largest hovercraft, two British Hovercraft Corporation SR.N Super 4s
which have been structurally enlarged so that each accommodates 424 passen¬
gers and 55 cars.
Passenger and freight ferry services are also operated to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Orkney, Shetland and a number of other
Scottish islands. The Government has issued a consultative document on the
structure of subsidies for ferry services to the Scottish islands and is examining
a system of support for these services based on road equivalent tariffs for the
distance covered.
The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for
most matters connected with merchant shipping, including general policy
towards the industry and Britain’s relations with other governments and inter¬
national organisations on shipping matters. The general policy is one of
minimum intervention by the Government, while encouraging free and fair
competition. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts the Department does, how¬
ever, administer many regulations for marine safety and welfare, and for
preventing and cleaning up pollution from ships (see p 185). For instance, it
certifies the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded;
ensures that standards of safety are observed in ship construction; ensures the
provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and deals
with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of
seamen. The Acts also contain certain reserve powers for protecting shipping
and trading interests from measures adopted or proposed by overseas
governments.
The Department’s duties are carried out from marine survey offices and
mercantile marine offices located at various ports. In the offices of the Regis¬
trar General of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record is kept of all ships
registered in Britain and its dependencies.
Various qualifications are required for employment on board ship in certain
grades. Responsibility for holding examinations and issuing certificates of
competency rests with the Department of Trade, except in the case of radio
officers where this is the function of the Home Office.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training for
seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National Sea
Training College at Gravesend (Kent), the world’s largest ratings’ establish¬
ment, which can accommodate some 2,000 ratings a year.
Wages and conditions of employment of most seafarers are negotiated by the
National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of representatives of
the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers’ trade unions. Under the
Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, seafarers are employed either as
‘registered seafarers’ or they may enter into a company service contract, for a
minimum of one year, for employment on the ships of a particular company.
Registered seafarers receive special benefits between voyages in addition to the
normal state benefits. The benefits paid to company service contract seafarers
must be at least equivalent to those paid to registered seafarers.

The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Marine Survey Service, the Coastguard Service, and certain adminis¬
trative functions concerning lighthouses and pilotage. It makes regulations to
implement international safety conventions and conducts inquiries into ship¬
ping casualties and accidents. Britain’s merchant fleet is one of the safest in the
world; it has a consistently lower record of ship losses than the world average.
The Coastguard Service is responsible for initiating and co-ordinating civil
marine search and rescue action in the United Kingdom Search and Rescue
Region (SRR). This is divided into six coastguard SRRs, each controlled by a
maritime rescue co-ordination centre supported by sub-centres, all of which
maintain continuous telecommunications watch on marine distress frequen¬
cies. In addition, at times of casualty risk a watch is kept at some 250 other
stations around the coast.
The Coastguard Service calls upon the lifeboats of the Royal National
Life-boat Institution (RNLI), Ministry of Defence aircraft and helicopters, a
long-range civilian helicopter based at Sumburgh (Shetland), and any other
ships or aircraft available to assist in rescue action. In 1979 the Coastguard
Service took action in 3,744 incidents (including cliff rescues) in which 6,870
people were assisted. The RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contribu¬
tions and depends for its operation on voluntary workers. In 1979 lifeboats
were launched 2,593 times and rescued 1,537 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which is administered by a
board of Elder Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the
Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These
authorities control about 350 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a
number of lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea
marks or by light towers.
In Britain there are 47 pilotage authorities for the 87 pilotage districts and over
1,500 licensed pilots. Trinity House is the largest pilotage authority, licensing
some 700 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales. In some cases the harbour
authority or local council is the pilotage authority. A Pilotage Commission has
been established to advise on the organisation of pilotage.
There are a number of traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain,
all of which have been adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consulta¬
tive Organisation (a United Nations agency with headquarters in London).
Compliance with these schemes is mandatory for all vessels of countries party
to the 1972 International Collision Regulations. The most important scheme
affecting British waters is in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s busiest
seaways. It consists of traffic lanes for shipping passing through the strait and
inshore traffic zones for use by local shipping. The number of collisions has
fallen considerably since the scheme was introduced. Britain and France
operate radar surveillance of the strait to keep watch on ships not conforming to
the scheme and, through the Channel Navigation Information Service, broad¬
cast navigational information to ships in the Dover Strait. The Langdon
Battery Operations Centre near Dover, opened in 1979, monitors ships passing
through the strait. With the installation in 1981 of an automatic data processing
system, which will be able to detect and track vessels automatically, it will

probably be the most advanced maritime centre of its kind in the world. The
Anglo-French Safety of Navigation Group, comprising representatives of
British and French government departments, is responsible for reviewing and
improving safety measures in the English Channel.
CIVIL AVIATION
Britain has a growing civil aviation industry which is continuing to develop to
meet the increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel.
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of indepen¬
dent airlines. Their fleets contain some of the most modern types of aircraft
including wide-bodied aircraft and the Concorde supersonic aircraft with
which British Airways inaugurated in 1976, jointly with Air France, the
world’s first supersonic passenger services. Many airports are being substan¬
tially modernised and new terminals installed.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with more than 100 other
countries, the licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain
by overseas operators and British participation in the activities of international
aviation bodies), airports policy, amenity matters (such as aircraft noise),
aviation security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body respon¬
sible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry; the
provision by the National Air Traffic Services, jointly with the Secretary of
State for Defence, of air navigation services and the aerodrome navigation
services at certain British airports; and eight aerodromes in Scotland. Mem¬
bers of the CAA are appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade.
The Authority’s primary objectives are to ensure that British airlines pro¬
vide air services to satisfy all major categories of public demand at the lowest
charges consistent with a high standard of safety and an economic return for
efficient operators, and to further the reasonable interests of air transport
users. Other duties are to ensure that British airlines compete effectively on
international routes, to secure the most efficient use of airports in Britain and
to have regard to the need to minimise the adverse effects of civil aviation on the
environment. The CAA received a grant from the Government of £24-4
million in 1979-80 to cover its loss-making operations: the operation of its
Scottish aerodromes (which are now subsidised by the Scottish Office) and the
provision of air navigation services in British airspace (for which grants will
continue to be paid until the arrangements for providing the services can be
altered by international agreement).
In 1979 a total of some 41-7 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) to or from Britain, 6-4 per cent more than in 1978. British
airlines have helped to pioneer new services and low fares, for example, Laker
Airways’ Skytrain services from London (Gatwick) to New York, Los Angeles
and Miami, while a number of airlines are proposing new services combined
with low fares to the continent of Europe. Total capacity offered on all services
by British airlines amounted to 12,751 million capacity-tonne-kilometres in
1979, 6-5 per cent more than in 1978. British Airways accounts for some 87 per
cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines, whereas the charter market
is dominated by independent companies.

The value of overseas trade carried by air rose by 17 per cent in 1979 to
£17,929 million, and the proportions of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air
amounted to 20 per cent of the value of exports and 17 per cent of imports. Air
freight is important for the carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio,
especially where speed of movement is essential. Precious stones (particularly
diamonds), live animals, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, clothing,
leather and skins, and scientific instruments are major categories where a
relatively high proportion of exports is sent by air.
British Airways is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of inter¬
national passengers carried and of international passenger-kilometres flown it
is the largest in the world. During 1979-80 British Airways’ turnover was
£1,920 million (including £1,654 million from airline operations), and it made
a net profit of £11 million. In March 1980 British Airways employed about
56,900 staff. Its assets of £1,037 million included £828 million of aircraft and
spares and £121 million of land and buildings. The status of British Airways is
to be changed from a nationalised industry to a private sector company. At the
appropriate time the Government will effect this change and intends to sell a
substantial minority of shares in the new company.
British Airways’ route network, covering some 590,738 kilometres (367,054
miles) of unduplicated route, is among the largest in the world. The airline
serves nearly 170 destinations in 80 countries and in 1979-80 carried some 17-3
million passengers on scheduled services. International scheduled services are
operated to the rest of Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, East
and South Africa, North America and Guyana in South America. Within
Britain it runs 1,400 services a week to 16 towns and cities throughout the
country. Scheduled Concorde services are operated from London (Heathrow)
to New York, and to Washington, covering these routes in about half the time
taken by subsonic aircraft. In 1975 British Airways inaugurated Europe’s first
air ‘shuttle’ service (a regular scheduled no-reservation service with back-up
aircraft to carry extra passengers) between Heathrow and Glasgow, and similar
services have been introduced from Heathrow to Edinburgh, Belfast and
Manchester. Joint shuttle services with national airlines to a number of other
European countries are being investigated.
Other activities carried out include helicopter services, engine overhaul
work, airport technical services and investments in a number of hotel com¬
panies and air companies in other countries.
British Airways operated 203 aircraft and helicopters in 1980. Aircraft
included 26 BAG One-Elevens, 20 Boeing 707s, 6 Boeing 737s, 27 Boeing
747s, 5 Concordes, 2 HS 748s, 15 Trident Ones, 16 Trident Twos, 25 Trident
Threes, 14 TriStars, 10 Super VCios and 11 Viscounts. Helicopters operated
comprised 23 Sikorsky 61 Ns, 1 Bell Jet Ranger and 2 Bell 212s. A large
investment programme is under way to replace the older aircraft, and major
orders for new aircraft include 22 Boeing 737s, 19 Boeing 757s, 9 TriStars and
3 Boeing Chinook helicopters.
The independent airlines carry 5 million passengers a year on scheduled
services and nearly 11 million on charter flights. The main independent
scheduled airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of
28 aircraft and carried i-6 million scheduled service passengers in 1979.
Its scheduled services are primarily to the continent of Europe, West and

Central Africa, South America and the United States. Other operators of
scheduled passenger services include Air UK, British Midland Airways and
Dan-Air Services. Dan-Air Services, Britannia Airways, Laker Airways and
Monarch Airlines are the leading independent airlines running charter passen¬
ger services.
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work, but are mainly employed on
the large-scale operations connected with the development of Britain’s offshore
oil and gas resources. Bristow Helicopters, which operates a fleet of more than
50 helicopters in Britain, is the world’s largest helicopter contracting business.
There are a small number of scheduled helicopter passenger services in
Britain, including a link between Heathrow and Gatwick airports, and routes
between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly, and Glasgow and Fort William.
Light aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other activities, such as
charter operations, search and rescue services, crop-spraying, and aerial sur¬
vey and photography.
Under the CAA’s air transport licensing system, British operators apply for
licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or variation of
existing licences. The CAA also considers changes in fares, both for British
carriers and for overseas carriers on services to and from Britain, and licenses
air travel organisers who charter aircraft for inclusive tours. The Air Transport
Users Committee, which is financed by the CAA but independent of it, makes
reports and recommendations to the CAA for furthering the interests of air
transport users including the investigation of complaints against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil aircraft
registered in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the safety require¬
ments concerning airline and general aviation operations, flight crew licensing
and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Airworthiness
Division is responsible for the airworthiness certification of aircraft, the licens¬
ing of aircraft maintenance engineers and the approval of maintenance
schedules for public transport aircraft. The CAA is advised in its duties by the
Airworthiness Requirements Board.
Every operator of aircraft used for public transport must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when it is satisfied that the
operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its aircraft. The CAA’s
flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) check that
satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Except for pilots with accept¬
able military or other experience, all candidates for a first professional pilot’s
licence must have undertaken a full-time course of ground and flying instruc¬
tion at a flying school approved by the CAA.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). The
planning and provision of the facilities necessary for control of aircraft at the
higher flight levels are carried out in conjunction with Eurocontrol, a Euro¬
pean agency of which Britain is a member. The Controller of the NATS
reports to both the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. The function of the
NATS is to secure the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic within

British airspace. It also provides air traffic services for aircraft flying over the
north-eastern quarter of the North Atlantic. At some 20 civil aerodromes,
including most of the major British airports, the NATS provides the navi¬
gation services necessary for the operation of aircraft taking off and landing,
and integrates them into the overall flow of traffic. To provide its services, the
NATS uses radar, some 100 navigational beacons, landing aids, air-to-ground
communications and an extensive telecommunications network.
Of the 140 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, nearly one-quarter each
handles more than 100,000 passengers a year. In 1979 Britain’s civil airports
handled a total of 57-8 million passengers (56-6 million terminal passengers
and 1 -2 million in transit), 8-4 per cent more than in 1978, and 795,300 tonnes
of freight. London’s Heathrow airport is the world’s busiest airport for inter¬
national travel, and is Britain’s most important airport for passengers and air
freight, handling 28-4 million passengers and 496,400 tonnes of freight in
1979. Gatwick, the second major airport in the London area, handled 8-8
million passengers in 1979. Other leading airports were Manchester, Glasgow,
Luton, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Belfast. While the number of
passengers has, in general, risen in recent years, there has not been a corres¬
ponding increase in air transport movements owing to the growing use of
wide-bodied aircraft.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body operat¬
ing on a commercial basis, owns and manages seven airports—Heathrow,
Gatwick and Stansted in south-east England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—which handle 76 per cent of air pas¬
sengers and 89 per cent of air cargo traffic in Britain. In 1979-80 the
BAA’s income was £191-4 million and it recorded a pre-tax profit of £35-5
million.
Sumburgh airport and seven small aerodromes in the Highlands and Islands
of Scotland are controlled by the CAA and Belfast’s airport (Aldergrove) is
managed by Northern Ireland Airports Ltd, a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are
controlled by local authorities. Except for those controlled by the Government
or by the CAA, all airports and all but a few minor private aerodromes must be
licensed by the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of
adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable runways, and of
air traffic control services and visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is
granted. Strict security measures are in force at airports.
The Government has decided that the growing demand for air trans¬
port facilities in south-east England should be met by the provision of
additional capacity at existing airports, especially Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted. It is also encouraging the maximum use of other main regional
airports.
A fourth major terminal is to be built at Heathrow, raising the airport’s
capacity from 30 million to 38 million passengers a year. Its first stage is
expected to be open in 1985. At Gatwick a £100 million redevelopment
programme has been virtually completed, increasing the airport’s annual
capacity to some 16 million passengers. A public inquiry has been held into the
BAA’s plans for a second passenger terminal, which, if approved, would be in
operation by the mid-1980s and would increase Gatwick’s capacity to about 25
million passengers a year. The BAA is working on plans for a new terminal at

Stansted, which would be capable of handling 15 million passengers a
year.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at several of Britain’s other airports.
A five-year development scheme, costing some £17 million, started in 1977 for
the expansion of terminal facilities at Aldergrove. A new passenger terminal is
planned at Birmingham airport. Offshore oil and gas activities have stimulated
expansion schemes at airports in north-east Britain, such as at Aberdeen,
where a new terminal was opened in 1977 and which has become one of the
world’s biggest heliports. At Sumburgh in Shetland the CAA has invested £30
million in developments including a new terminal for oil-related traffic.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, telecommunications, data
processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the Post
Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and other members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of
State for Industry. With some 400,000 employees, it is the largest commercial
employer in Europe. The Government intends to separate the Post Office into
two corporations, one for postal and banking services and the other for tele¬
communications, and legislation to create a new telecommunications corpora¬
tion is being prepared. The legislation will also contain provisions for relaxing
the Post Office’s monopoly position in postal and telecommunications services.
In 1979-80 the Post Office’s income, excluding internal transactions, was
£5,193 million and a profit of £297 million was recorded, with profits of £236-1
million on telecommunications and £49’3 million on posts. Capital expendi¬
ture on fixed assets amounted to £1,290 million in 1979—80. Over £80 million
was spent on research and development, mostly at the Post Office’s research
centre at Martlesham Heath (Suffolk).
The Post Office pioneered postal services and was the first service to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. It provides
deliveries each working day to 22 million addresses. In 1979—80 the Post Office
handled some 180 million parcels and 10,027 million items of other correspon¬
dence (including 9,609 million inland letters).
Postal operations are being mechanised and by 1982 there will be a national
network of 83 mechanised high-speed sorting offices. Large parcel centres,
each serving a group of counties, are gradually taking over the work of the
1,200 offices which handle parcels manually. Mechanised sorting is aided by
the use of postcodes, of which there are 1 -5 million; Britain’s postcode system
is one of the most sophisticated in the world.
Britain has 22,600 post offices, of which 1,580 are operated directly by the Post
Office and the remainder on an agency basis by sub-postmasters. At a post
office counter, besides making use of postal and telegraph facilities, a person
may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a dog licence, a television
receiving licence, renew a motor vehicle licence, obtain a British visitor’s
passport, buy national insurance stamps, and use the facilities of the National
Savings Bank (see p 361) and of the National Girobank (see p 359). In much of
its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government departments
and local authorities.

The Post Office provides a range of 40 specialist services, mainly for com¬
merce. ‘Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight delivery service originally for
computer data, has been expanded to include documents, medical samples and
spare parts, and handles 3-8 million packets a year. There are International
Datapost links with 16 countries. An ‘Expresspost’ messenger service provides
a rapid delivery within or between certain main cities. About one-third of the
Post Office’s philatelic business, which mainly involves the sale of stamps to
collectors or dealers, is conducted by the Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh. The
British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance on all aspects of
postal business to overseas postal administrations, and over 20 countries have
used its services.
Britain has some 26-7 million telephones, 17-6 million exchange connections,
86,000 telex connections and 67,000 data transmission modems (more than in
any country except the United States). The Post Office’s telecommunications
business employs 240,000 people, has assets of £7,400 million, and runs eight
factories and a fleet of nearly 54,000 telecommunications vehicles.
In 1979-80 some 20,079 million telephone calls were made in Britain compris¬
ing 16,600 million local calls, 3,257 million trunk calls and 222 million inter¬
national calls. Subscribers dial virtually all local and trunk telephone calls, and
about 90 per cent of international calls are dialled direct. Over 96 per cent of
Britain’s telephone subscribers can dial direct to 100 countries. To back up its
nationwide system of cables, the Post Office has built a network of radio towers
for transmitting telephone calls, television programmes and computer data
over microwave channels.
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected rapidly and
free of charge to the police, ambulance or fire brigade. Of the 599 million calls
made to recorded information services in 1979-80, over 431 million were to the
speaking clock. Other services include Dial a Disc, weather forecasts, sports
results, motoring information, recipes, bedtime stories and Financial Times
Index and Business News Summary.
Some 1,085 electronic exchanges are in use in Britain and 479 more have been
ordered. They are more reliable than conventional electro-mechanical
exchanges as they have very few moving parts and so require less maintenance.
Most electronic exchanges are of the TXE2 type, with a capacity of up to 7,000
lines. Larger TXE4 exchanges, with a capacity of up to 40,000 lines, have been
brought into service since 1976, and the first orders for an improved version,
the TXE4A, have been placed. A series of new switching and associated
systems for telephone exchanges, known as System X, using microelectronics
technology, integrated digital transmission and switching, stored program
(software) control and common channel signalling, has been developed. The
first System X exchange, a junction tandem exchange in the City of London,
entered service in July 1980 and the first local exchange, at Woodbridge
(Suffolk), is due to be operating by the end of 1980.
The demand for international calls is doubling every four or five years and the
Post Office has increased the amount of equipment in its international
exchanges substantially and raised the number of cable and satellite circuits
linking Britain with other countries from nearly 3,000 in 1970 to nearly 16,000

in mid-1980. Nearly 70 per cent of the intercontinental telephone traffic to or
from Britain is carried by satellite. Three aerials at the Goonhilly earth station
in Cornwall provide commercial telecommunications services via high-
capacity geostationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans. A fourth aerial is sending test speech and television signals to the
European Space Agency’s orbital test satellite, as the first step in the European
Communications Satellite project (the responsibility of Eutelsat, an organisa¬
tion set up by the telecommunication administrations of 17 European
countries) intended to provide high-capacity links across Europe and the
Mediterranean. Britain has the second largest interest in Intelsat, the world
space communications satellite network. A second earth station at Madley near
Hereford, opened in 1978, is helping the Post Office to cope with the growth in
international traffic. It carries about 1 million calls a month between Britain
and some 40 other countries. Its second aerial was completed in March 1980
and a third should be operating in mid-1981.
There are 17 submarine cables, covering a total of 19,000 nautical miles
(35,200 kilometres), from Britain to the continent of Europe, the Irish Re¬
public and the Faroe Islands, and three cables from Britain to North America.
In 1979 the Post Office set up BPO Telconsult as an international consul¬
tancy service to advise on the selection and installation of telecommunication
systems.
The Post Office’s ‘Prestel’ service, the world’s first public viewdata service,
was inaugurated in 1979. It enables information to be obtained through the
telephone network from a computer for display on a suitably equipped tele¬
vision set in words, figures and simple graphics. Some 150,000 ‘pages’ of
information are being provided from over 130 sources. Information is available
on a wide range of subjects such as Government services, financial services,
jobs and careers, housing, travel and sports results. Prestel is available in a
number of cities including London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Edinburgh
and Glasgow. The Post Office has sold Prestel software to telecommunications
authorities in a number of countries. In 1980 the Post Office launched a trial
international Prestel service for business users in Britain, Australia, the Fed¬
eral Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the
United States. (‘Teletext’ information services transmitted by broadcasting
instead of the telephone network are operated by the British Broadcasting
Corporation and the Independent Broadcasting Authority, see p 426.)
The Post Office provides communications links and radio services for shipping
through one long-range and 11 medium-range radio stations around the coast¬
line of Britain, while oil and gas production platforms in the North Sea are
linked to Britain’s telecommunications network by transhorizon radio. At all
medium-range stations a continuous watch is maintained on the international
distress frequencies. A number of remotely controlled short-range coast radio
stations provide radiotelephone links with ships at sea at a range of up to 50
miles (80 kilometres). Britain, through the Post Office, has the third largest
share in the International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) Organisation,
which came into existence in 1979 and will provide satellite capacity to improve
maritime communications. A fifth aerial will be built at Goonhilly in Cornwall.
Post Office Datel services provide for transmission of information for com¬
puters and other automatic processors. A wide variety of data transmission
facilities, at speeds from 50 bits a second to 50,000 bits a second, including an
Telex
Telegrams

internationally compatible service at 2,400 bits a second, are provided using
Post Office circuits. The services consist of a suitable telegraph or telephone
line and, when necessary, a modem (which converts digital signals into voice
frequencies for transmission).
The British telex service is fully automatic. Demand for inland and inter¬
national telex services is growing and the number of connections has more than
doubled since 1971. Customers can dial direct to 155 countries and 98 per cent
of all international calls are dialled direct. Britain’s first computer-controlled
telex exchange handling international automatic calls was installed in London
in 1978 and a second is due to be brought into operation in 1981.
International telegrams are transmitted through the Post Office’s computer-
controlled Telegram Retransmission Centre in London. It is one of the largest
in the world, and has direct access via satellite, cable and radio circuits to over
87 terminals in 75 countries.
The Post Office is developing several new telecommunications services. A
national radiopaging service, providing direct dialling access over the public
telephone network to small lightweight portable receivers, is to be established
later in 1980 following trials in Greater London and the Thames Valley.
Intelpost, the world’s first international public facsimile service transmit¬
ting letters and other documents by satellite, was inaugurated in June 1980
between Britain and Canada. Links with other countries are under considera¬
tion and there are plans to introduce an internal service within Britain.
The Post Office is participating in Euronet DIANE, a European Com¬
munity project to provide access to computerised information on a wide range
of subjects via a Community-wide data transmission network. It is responsible
for the operation of the network management centre, in London, and for
running an automated ‘directory enquiry’ service in six languages. Towards
the end of 1980 the Post Office will inaugurate a fully commercial packet
switching service for computer data in Britain; an international service is
already available to the United States and Canada.
Optical fibres (very thin strands of glass capable of carrying large numbers
of telephone calls simultaneously) are already installed in the telephone cable
network on an experimental basis. They are being brought into service and are
expected to result in substantial savings as they are smaller than conventional
cables and require less amplifying equipment to boost long-distance calls.
Work on laying the first optical fibre cables is in progress and by the end of 1982
the network, of over 3,500 kilometres (2,200 miles), will be the most com¬
prehensive of its kind in the world.
The Post Office has a Data Processing Executive for internal services, and a
comprehensive bureau service, known as National Data Processing, for indus¬
try and commerce. It operates some of the most comprehensive data process¬
ing systems in Europe and has implemented more than 1,800 projects.
17 Employment
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force with high levels of
technical and commercial skills. To ensure as far as possible that people can
find work best suited to their capabilities and that the working population, like
the country’s other economic resources, is fully utilised, the Government
intervenes in the labour market in a number of ways: by providing employ¬
ment services; by supplementing the training undertaken by employers; by
policies to promote regional development and labour mobility; by measures to
alleviate unemployment; through legislation to regulate terms and conditions
of employment and improve industrial relations; and through legislation relat¬
ing to health and safety at work.
THE WORKING POPULATION
The total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1979 was 26-4
million, about 48 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed, the
self-employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working popu¬
lation, there remained 22-8 million employees (i3'3 million men and 9-5
million women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those
working part-time) in the labour force continues to rise, although at a reduced
rate compared with previous years. The great majority of the working popu¬
lation work for a wage or salary, but nearly 2 million are employers or
self-employed. The working population increased slowly until 1966, then
declined between 1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table
26). One reason for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time
education. During the next few years both the male and female labour forces
are expected to continue to increase. In June 1979 men accounted for 58 per
cent of all employees and women for 42 per cent (about two-fifths of whom
worked part-time).

EMPLOYMENT 327
The distribution of employees by industry in 1970 and 1979 is shown in
Table 27.
The most notable trend in the employment pattern during the last decade
has been the transfer of employment from manufacturing to service industries.
Technological developments have increased automation, with a consequently
reduced demand for manpower, and have assisted the growth of manufactur¬
ing capacity in other countries, particularly developing ones. New and, in
some cases, cheaper services have been introduced through advances in tech¬
nology, while improvements in living standards have led to an increasing
demand for services. There is considerable public discussion of the social and
economic effects of micro-electronic technology.
The high level of unemployment during the recession (see p 330) is also a
major concern.
MANPOWER POLICY
In Great Britain the Department of Employment is generally responsible for
employment policy, industrial relations and pay policy, and for the payment of
unemployment benefit, but the Manpower Services Commission (MSC)
advises the Government on manpower policy issues.

328 BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The MSC, which is separate from the Government but accountable to the
Secretaries of State for Employment, Scotland and Wales, has a chairman and
nine other members who are appointed after consultation with employers and
employees, and local government and educational interests. Scottish and
Welsh committees of the MSC consider special Scottish and Welsh aspects of
manpower issues. Most of the MSC’s activities are financed from public funds;
expenditure in 1979-80 amounted to £609 million (plus £113 million on behalf
of the Department of Employment). The MSC is advised by a network of
district manpower committees on which employers, employees and other local
interests are represented.
The MSC’s main statutory duty is to make such arrangements as it considers
appropriate, within a general policy framework agreed with Ministers, for
assisting people to select, train for, obtain and retain employment, and for
assisting employers to obtain suitable employees. The services in Northern
Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department of Manpower Services.
EMPLOYMENT The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
SERVICES provided in Great Britain by the MSC’s Employment Service Division, the
principal aim of which is to provide a comprehensive service for employers
needing staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking
jobs. It operates through a network of about 1,000 local jobcentres and
employment offices which handle all occupations except professional, scien¬
tific, technical and managerial, for which the MSC’s Professional and Execu¬
tive Recruitment is responsible. Jobcentres, where the provision of self-service
facilities for job-seekers is a standard feature, are gradually replacing employ¬
ment offices where such facilities do not always exist.
Though use of the service by both employers and job-seekers is voluntary, in
the year to March 1980 over 6 million people registered for employment, 2-7
million vacancies were notified and 1-9 million were placed in employment.
Special Special employment services include services for disabled people, services to
Services assist the geographical mobility of workers, Professional and Executive
Recruitment and the Careers Service.
Services for The public employment service has long provided a resettlement service to
Disabled People disabled people. This is provided by over 500 specially trained Disablement
Resettlement Officers (DROs) who can advise on rehabilitation and training
courses and on the comprehensive range of special schemes and facilities
available. They can also advise employers on aspects of employing disabled
people, including grants available for adaptation to premises and equipment in
order to employ or retrain a specific disabled person. The DROs administer
the quota scheme which, under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944,
requires employers who employ 20 or more people to include 3 per cent
registered disabled people among their workforce. Employment rehabilitation
is provided at 27 centres (including one linked with a medical rehabilitation
unit); in 1979 some 15,500 people attended the wide range of courses available.
The MSC also gives financial assistance to voluntary and local authority bodies
concerned with specific disabilities such as blindness, cerebral palsy and
psychiatric disorders; in 1979 more than 600 people passed through these
courses. As part of its ‘Fit for Work’ campaign to improve the employment
prospects of disabled people, the MSC in 1979 instituted a scheme of annual
awards to give public recognition to firms which excel in carrying out construc¬
tive policies on the employment of disabled people.

There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at ‘skillcentres’,
educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more seriously
disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary organ¬
isations with the help of the MSC’s Training Services Division. Grants are
available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for profes¬
sional or comparable employment.
Sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled in Great Britain
by Remploy Ltd, a non-profit making company, and in Northern Ireland by
Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd, a company constituted similarly to Rem¬
ploy, and by local authorities and voluntary organisations. Sheltered Employ¬
ment Procurement and Consultancy Services is a unit of the MSC set up to
offer consultancy, and other services to sheltered workshops. The MSC also
works in close co-operation with the National Advisory Council on Employ¬
ment of Disabled People.
In 1979 the MSC and the Northern Ireland Department of Manpower
Services helped with the cost of providing places for over 14,000 severely
disabled people, of whom approximately 1,900 were blind or partially sighted
and some 280 were trainees.
In order to ease regional imbalances in unemployment and job opportunities,
the MSC provides financial assistance under the Job Search and Employment
Transfer Scheme to enable people who are unemployed, or under threat of
redundancy to look for and to move to jobs away from their homes. The
assistance includes a range of grants and allowances to help with the cost of
attending interviews, visiting new areas to look for work, and living away from
home and moving home to the new area.
Similar schemes are operated in Northern Ireland by the Department of
Manpower Services.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) is a specialist branch of the
MSC which provides a recruitment service for employers who wish to engage
professional, managerial, scientific or technical staff and assists people seeking
employment at this level. PER operates nationally, through a network of
offices and offers a comprehensive recruitment service which includes selec¬
tion, interviewing and advertising. The service is free for job-seekers, while
employers are charged a fee based on the type of service used. A broadly similar
service, known as Professional and Executive Personnel and free to both
employers and candidates, is operated in Northern Ireland.
Local education authorities have a statutory obligation under the Employment
and Training Act 1973 to provide a careers service, a vocational guidance
service for people attending all educational institutions (except universities)
and an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities also provide an
employment service for people, especially young people, in their early years at
work. There is close co-operation with the MSC’s employment service division
which also caters for those who have left school and choose to use its facilities in
preference to those of the careers service.
In Northern Ireland the careers service is an integral part of the Department
of Manpower Services.
The MSC Careers and Occupational Information Centre publishes a wide
range of material to help people looking for jobs to make an informed choice,
and distributes careers literature to some 15,000 schools, careers offices and
other centres.

EMPLOYMENT
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p 12, but excluding
nationals of other European Community countries and Gibraltar) need a work
permit issued by the Department of Employment. This must be applied for by
the prospective employer for a specific person and is issued for a specific job
and for a fixed period not exceeding 12 months in the first instance. People
admitted as holders of work permits may change their jobs only with the
approval of the Department of Employment. Normally further leave to remain
will be given on application to the Home Office if they remain in approved
employment. The Home Office will consider an application to remove the
conditions attached to their stay after four years in approved employment, and
if granted, a worker may change employment without restriction. Among
other conditions, work permits are issued only for work requiring a recognised
professional qualification, or a high degree of skill or experience, where the
Department of Employment is satisfied that the worker is necessary and there
is no suitable worker in Britain or in other European Community countries to
fill the post, and where the wages and conditions are not less favourable than
for similar work. In general, the age limits for permits in most categories are
23-54 years. People coming for certain kinds of specialist employment (for
example, doctors or dentists taking up professional appointments; ministers of
religion; representatives of overseas newspapers, news agencies or broadcast¬
ing organisations; the self-employed) do not require work permits but may
require entry clearances issued by a British Consulate or High Commission.
In addition, permits are issued under the Training and Work Experience
Scheme for nationals of countries outside the European Community who are
undertaking limited periods of training or work experience leading to the
acquisition of a particular occupational skill or qualification. Permits are also
issued for young people from outside the European Community to undertake
short periods of employment intended to broaden their industrial or commer¬
cial experience and, if appropriate, to improve their knowledge of English.
European Community regulations establish the right of workers to move
freely between member States for the purposes of employment. European
Community workers entering another member State are entitled to be treated
in the same way as nationals of that State as regards facilities of the national
employment services, pay and working conditions, trade union rights, voca¬
tional training and retraining facilities, access to housing and property, and
social security and industrial injury benefits. Workers who wish to remain in
the United Kingdom for longer than an initial period of six months must apply
to the Home Office for a residence permit. If they are in permanent employ¬
ment the residence permit is normally valid for five years. If the employment is
temporary (that is, for less than a year) the permit is valid for the expected
duration of the employment.
The Department of Employment operates a Race Relations Employment
Advisory Service with advisers based in the main areas where ethnic minorities
have settled. Its general aim is to promote equal opportunity in employment
regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, and its advisers
offer help and guidance to employers and unions on a wide range of issues
which arise in the employment of a multi-racial workforce.
As in many other industrial countries, unemployment in Britain rose sharply
during the 1970s, with some fluctuations; by 1980 it had reached the highest
level since the 1930s while remaining relatively low in the south-east of

England, it has been consistently higher in those parts of the country which
have the greatest dependence on shipbuilding and certain branches of the
heavy engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scot¬
land and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. The general un¬
employment rate in Great Britain in August 1980 was 6-9 per cent: the areas
with the highest rates were Wales and Scotland and the north of England. The
unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in other
parts of the United Kingdom. In August 1980 it was 12-7 per cent of all
employees.
Various measures have been introduced with the aim of mitigating the effects
of high unemployment by providing job or training opportunities for people
who would otherwise be unemployed.
The measures include: a scheme to encourage employers to use short-time
working as an alternative to redundancies; a youth opportunities programme
to provide a range of training and work experience opportunities to un¬
employed 16—18 year olds; a special temporary employment programme to
provide worthwhile temporary jobs for adults in special development areas,
development areas and designated inner city areas, who have been unemployed
for a long time; a ‘job release’ scheme to encourage older workers, approaching
pensionable age, to leave work early and release jobs for younger unemployed
people; a ‘job introduction’ scheme for disabled people; and support for
training places in industry. In August 1980 some 374,000 people were being
helped through these measures and further measures are in hand.
The Government’s general policy of helping small firms is also intended to
alleviate unemployment.
The main responsibility for carrying out industrial and commercial training
lies with individual employers, but in recent years the MSC, with government
support, has evolved a comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply of
trained manpower needed by the economy, to provide opportunities for
individuals to acquire new skills, and to improve the efficiency and effective¬
ness of training generally. The MSC’s Training Services Division is respon¬
sible for putting these programmes into effect.
There are 23 industrial training boards and one industrial training committee,
covering firms employing about 60 per cent of all employees, which are
responsible for promoting training in their respective industries. They receive
Exchequer funds to meet their advisory service and other costs and to enable
them to pay grants to employers to encourage training activities of national
importance (supplemented, during periods of economic recession, by special
grants to support craft and technician training). The boards’ five-year
strategies and short-term operating plans and budgets are agreed with the
MSC. The MSC also promotes training for some 10 million people employed
in industries not covered by industrial training boards, maintaining liaison
with major training organisations in this sector.
The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to complement
the training given in industry and commerce by providing individuals over
the age of 19 with the opportunity to acquire new skills. Training is carried
out at the Training Services Division’s own skillcentres and annexes and at
many colleges and employers’ establishments. Skillcentre courses concen¬
trate mainly on engineering, construction and automotive trades and those

at colleges on clerical and commercial, management, technician and other
skills.
Special priority has been given to expanding and developing technician
training particularly for computer operations. In addition, electronics
engineering courses biased towards micro-electronics and micro-processor
applications have been established in several centres. In all about 500 different
courses are available in a wide range of occupations. Trainees are paid allow¬
ances which vary with domestic responsibilities and may receive, among other
things, an earnings-related supplement, travelling expenses and a lodging
allowance. Some 74,500 adults were trained under TOPS in 1979-80.
The MSC also provides a number of other direct training services to
employers.
The Training Within Industry scheme is intended to develop the skills of
supervisors in developing leadership, instructing and communicating, improv¬
ing methods and improving safety practices. Special courses are also available
for supervisors employed in offices. Courses in international trade procedures
are available for staff employed in export/import offices. Courses in instruc¬
tional techniques are available to skillcentre staff and industrial and commer¬
cial firms at the MSC’s two instructor training colleges (one in England and
one in Scotland) and at three instructor training units attached to skillcentres.
In-plant courses are also available.
Employers are able to sponsor their own employees for refresher and up¬
grading training at skillcentres, on courses designed specifically to meet the
needs of the employer and of the employees concerned. There is also a
complementary mobile instructor service for employers, which provides
specific training for employees in their own workshops.
Training services at skillcentres and courses at instructor training colleges
are also available to trainees from overseas. These facilities are increasingly
being used by overseas governments and organisations, and in every case
programmes are structured to meet agreed training objectives.
EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION LAW
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees. The determination by statute of
minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay is confined in principle to those
trades and industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both,
is inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to ensure their observ¬
ance. However, recent legislation, consolidated in the Employment Protection
(Consolidation) Act 1978, provides considerable safeguards for employees in
their terms of employment.
An employer is required to give employees written information on their
terms and conditions of employment, the disciplinary rules applicable to them
and the procedure available where an employee has a grievance about his or her
employment or is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision; minimum periods
of notice when employment is to be terminated are also laid down for both
employers and employees. Employees with a minimum period of service of 104
weeks are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease to exist
(for example, because of technological improvements or a fall in demand) and
their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly
met from a fund subscribed to by industry. Protection against unfair dismissal
is provided by machinery under which an employee may complain against an

employer of unfair dismissal, and, if successful, obtain reinstatement, re¬
engagement or compensation; under the Employment Act 1980, however, new
employees in firms employing 20 or fewer people must be employed for two
years before they have the right to complain of unfair dismissal. Legal support
is given to the right to trade union organisation by making it unfair to dismiss a
person because of membership or participation in the activities of an indepen¬
dent trade union; rights of employees are also protected in regard to penalisa¬
tion short of dismissal because of trade union membership or activities. Other
rights which are maintained in the 1978 Act include limited payment when
work is not available for reasons other than as a result of a trade dispute, and
maternity rights for female employees, including protection from dismissal
because of pregnancy, maternity pay, and the right, within certain limits, to
return to work after confinement.
The Race Relations Act 1976 (see p 154) makes unlawful discrimination on
grounds of colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or
national origin, in employment, training and related matters. Employers may
not discriminate when recruiting workers or in their treatment of employees in
regard to their terms and conditions of employment, promotion, transfer,
training and access to other benefits, or to their dismissal.
The employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act (see p 152) make
sex discrimination unlawful in employment, training and related matters. An
employer may not discriminate between men and women either in recruitment
or in treatment of existing employees in such matters as promotion, training,
transfer, benefits, facilities and dismissal. It is also unlawful for a married
person to be treated less favourably than an unmarried person of the same sex.
PAY, HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS
Pay for manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupations, is
normally set by collective bargaining (see p 338). In a small number of
industries and trades legally enforceable minimum rates are set by wages
councils.
Basic rates of pay vary widely, though in private industry local rates
normally exceed the rates specified in national agreements. Higher rates are
usually paid for overtime and shift work, and weekly earnings may be further
increased by incentive bonus schemes. Piecework, or payment-by-results, is
still common, though of declining importance as production methods in many
industries increasingly dictate employees’ output.
According to the latest annual survey conducted by the Department of
Employment into earnings and hours of work, the average weekly earnings of
full-time male adult manual workers in manufacturing and some non¬
manufacturing industries in October 1979 were, including overtime, £96-94;
while for full-time female adult manual workers they were £58-24. Women’s
earnings are thus markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average
they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, and partly
because they tend to be concentrated in the less well-paid jobs. The Equal Pay
Act 1970 requires that a woman doing the same or broadly similar work as a
man, or work that has been given equal value by job evaluation, should receive
equal pay and conditions of employment.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally by
annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments,
334
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and such careers generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with
higher remuneration. Starting salaries may be in the range of £3,000 to £3,500
(lower for 16 to 18 year-old trainees and higher for some graduates entering
industry).
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £14,000 to £20,000 a year gross before tax.
The posts with salaries in the range of £20,000 to £40,000 a year include those
of Cabinet Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions
in government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of
daily newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the
higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. Salaries of
chairmen of major companies may exceed £50,000 a year gross, and other
people such as star entertainers often receive more through fees or fixed
contracts. The range of net incomes in the country as a whole is, however,
reduced by a system of progressive taxation.
Hours of Work The normal working week in Britain is in the range 38-40 hours for manual
work and 35-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked in manual occupations differ from their standard hours;
in October 1979 they were 44 for men compared with 37-4 for women. Men
and women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than
manual workers.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act for adult women
over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment of women and
young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for
young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to
certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make exemptions
from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the hours of
work of adult men, or of people not working in factories, are not restricted by
statute.
Holidays with Holiday entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements.
Pay and Public These generally provide for at least three weeks paid holiday a year. However
Holidays about half of manual workers covered by agreements have entitlements of four
weeks. Non-manual workers generally have longer holidays than manual
workers. Additional holidays, dependent upon length of service, are also quite
common.
In addition to annual holidays, most agreements provide for bank holidays
or public holidays. In England and Wales, in addition to Christmas Day and
Good Friday, regular bank holidays take place on New Year’s Day, Easter
Monday, the first Monday in May, the last Monday in May, the last Monday in
August and 26 December. In Scotland public holidays are declared locally;
regular bank holidays are New Year’s Day, 2 January, Good Friday, the first
Monday in May, the last Monday in May, the first Monday in August,
Christmas Day and 26 December. The English and Welsh bank holidays apply
also to Northern Ireland, where in addition St Patrick’s Day (17 March) and 12
and 13 July are public holidays; in certain areas the Tuesday after Easter is also
a customary holiday for industry and trade.
Provision for an alternative day to be observed is made when any bank or
public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.

335
‘Fringe’
Benefits
Social Security
TRADE UNIONS
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. About half of
employees in employment are covered by occupational pension schemes (see
p 144). Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay schemes,
additional or complementary to the State schemes (see p 147), and by schemes
to provide private medical treatment. A smaller number are covered by
schemes for redundancy payments above the statutory minimum. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and professional employees receiving a
standard salary than among manual workers, who have a chance to increase
their pay—for example, by working overtime. Employees may have use of a
company car and some firms provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes.
In accord with its view that share ownership and profit-sharing can help in
developing employees’ understanding of, and commitment to business and
industry, the Government has extended fiscal measures designed to encourage
profit-sharing.
Social security benefits, which include unemployment, sickness and industrial
injury benefits, are described in the Social Welfare chapter.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of employees
and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on freely
conducted negotiations between them at all levels. The State is ready to
provide assistance where the organisation of employees, employers, or both, is
inadequate to conduct negotiations, or where the usual methods of resolving
disagreements have failed. In all industries and services annual strike losses
over the ten years 1969-78 averaged less than half a day per employee.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably, as do their traditions. In the last decade or
so, trade unionism has again increased particularly among clerical, supervis¬
ory, technical and administrative workers. Trade unions may be organised
either by occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed) or by industry. Some are based on a combination of both principles.
In some firms membership of the relevant trade union is required by
agreement between the employer and union (‘closed shops’). At the end of
1978 the total membership of British trade unions was 13 million. There
were 480 unions, but nearly 80 per cent of all trade unionists were in the
26 largest unions, each with a membership of 100,000 or over, while only
o-6 per cent were in the 263 smallest unions with under 1,000 members
each.
The Certification Officer appointed under the Employment Protection Act
1975 is required to maintain a list of trade unions. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers and
that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between workers
and employers, or between workers and employers’ associations. Under the
Employment Protection Act 1975 and other legislation, certain rights and
privileges are reserved for independent trade unions. A trade union on the list
may apply to the Certification Officer for a certificate that it is independent of
employers.
336
Trades Union
Congress
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of dele¬
gates from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest
authority of unions, and carry out policy decisions made by the conference
delegates. Most unions also have regional and district organisations. At the
level of the individual member there are local branches, covering one or more
workplaces. Members may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about
terms and conditions of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take
part in the election of the union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain
matters considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its
views on wider issues for action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The
organising of members in individual places of work, and the negotiation of local
pay agreements with managements at the factory or plant, may be done by
full-time district officials of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’,
who are chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to represent them.
Trade unions vary in the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into
their organisation. Where two or more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards’ committees may be formed to discuss matters of
common concern.
Many unions provide ‘strike pay’ for members involved in official industrial
action. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer injury or
contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs where a case for
compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case of illness,
accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under the national
insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions. Many trade
unions are affiliated to the Labour Party. Any trade union wishing to use
money for political purposes must set up a separate fund, subject to special
rules, one of which must allow any member who objects to contributing to the
fund to opt out.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), which was founded in 1868. The TUC’s objects are to
promote the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the
economic and social conditions of working people. Its affiliated membership
comprises in trade unions which together represent 12 • 1 million workpeople,
or 92 per cent of all trade unionists in Britain. The TUC deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and
gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries.
Through membership of the National Economic Development Council (see
p 203, it participates in discussions relating to the national economy.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern
to trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council
which represents it between Congresses and is responsible for carrying out
Congress decisions, watching economic and social developments, providing
educational and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government
the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The
council is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circum¬
stances, and uses its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional
stoppages of work, as well as official disputes.
The TUC, as well as many individual unions, conducts extensive educa¬
tional services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade
unionism and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through

TIONS
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers’
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the
Government’s eight planning regions (see p 175) with a further similar body
for Wales known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose
function is to make representations to the Government’s various regional
bodies, co-ordinate the activities of trade unions in the regions and keep them
in touch with the policy of the TUC at national level.
Scottish trade unions also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress (STUC), which in many respects is similar in con¬
stitution and function to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes
Scottish workers may affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are in
fact affiliated to both bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are rep¬
resented by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU), though the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland
belong to unions based in Great Britain. Almost 90 per cent of Northern
Ireland trade unionists are members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU,
while the majority belong to unions which are also affiliated to the TUC.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations, a large
number of which are wholly or partly concerned with labour matters. The
primary aims of such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with
employees and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of
settling any disputes which may arise. They may also represent members’
points of view as manufacturers or traders to the Government on commercial
matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional organisa¬
tions combined into national federations, while in others, within which
different firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a
complex structure with national and regional federations for parts of an indus¬
try as well as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 150 national
employers’ organisations, which negotiate the national collective agreements
for their industry with the trade unions concerned. Many of these national
organisations belong to the Confederation of British Industry.
The final authority of local or small national organisations may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organ¬
isations or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to
ratify their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the
day-to-day work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group,
consisting of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with
urgent questions and co-ordinate the work of committees. Employers’ associa¬
tions (as defined in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974) may

apply to the Certification Officer for inclusion in the list of employers’ associa¬
tions maintained by the officer.
The central body of employers is the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
which deals with all matters affecting the interests of employers and represents
them nationally to the Government and the public and also internationally, for
instance, in the International Labour Organisation and in the various institu¬
tions of the European Community. It is also the British member of the Union
of Industries of the European Communities and the Business and Industry
Advisory Committee to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and a member of the British national committee of the Inter¬
national Chamber of Commerce. Most national employers’ organisations and
nationalised industries and a large number of individual companies, both large
and small, belong to the CBI, whose representatives or nominees sit on various
official bodies and take part in the discussion of matters of importance to the
national economy through their membership of the National Economic
Development Council (see p 203).
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 defines the status of trade
unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal requirements
which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on trade unions in
respect of actions taken in support of a trade dispute, allows peaceful picketing,
and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally enforceable
unless they are written agreements and specifically provide for this.
The Employment Protection Act 1975 placed the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service on a statutory basis, provided for the appointment of a
Certification Officer and for the setting up of the Central Arbitration
Committee; and established an Employment Appeal Tribunal to hear appeals j
concerning decisions of the Certification Officer and of industrial tribunals.
(Industrial tribunals are independent judicial bodies which deal, in general,
with complaints from employees on infringements of individual rights under a
number of Acts concerning, for example, redundancy payments, contracts of
employment, equal pay, unfair dismissals and sex discrimination.)
The Employment Act 1980 seeks to obtain a balance between rights and
responsibilities in industrial relations. It enables the Government to make
funds available to encourage the wider use of secret union ballots and to
produce codes of practice to promote good industrial relations. It limits lawful
picketing to the picket’s own place of work and restricts the scope for secondary
action such as blacking and sympathetic strikes. It provides greater protection
for the individual in relation to the closed shop and makes a number of changes
to employment protection legislation, particularly to help small firms. Draft
codes of practice on the conduct of picketing and the closed shop were
published in August 1980.
Northern Ireland has a similar but separate system of industrial relations under
which certain responsibilities devolve upon the Labour Relations Agency.
Industrial relations legislation enacted in 1976 has brought the province largely
into line with similar legislation enacted in Great Britain since 1974.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for the
conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement j
between employers and trade unions. Agreements may be industry-wide,
supplemented as necessary by informal local agreements in firms or factories, 1

or at firm and factory level (plant bargaining). In the public sector agreements
are generally reached at industry level. In some industries, firms and factories,
negotiations are conducted by meetings held when necessary, while in others,
joint negotiating councils or committees have been established on a permanent
basis. The scope of the various joint bodies (from the national joint industrial
councils for whole industries to the works councils and committees in
individual workplaces) varies widely, and has frequently been extended to
cover such additional matters as production plans, absenteeism, training,
education and welfare. Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining
suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is sometimes made
for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent concilia¬
tion or arbitration. The Employment Protection Act 1975 made provision for
information needed for collective bargaining purposes to be disclosed by
employers to trade unions, subject to certain safeguards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the TUC, the CBI, and the nationalised industries through the
National Economic Development Council on matters in which employers and
workers have a common interest. The operation of collective bargaining has
from time to time been restricted in an attempt to control inflation.
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) has the general
duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in particular of
encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the development and
(where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
In 1976 ACAS was placed on a statutory basis under the Employment
Protection Act and is controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and nine
other members experienced in industrial relations, of which three are nomi¬
nated after consultation with the CBI, three after consultation with the TUC,
and three are independent.
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors of industry where this is thought to be helpful, and
has discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need
to pay regard to agreed procedures in the industry or area of employment con¬
cerned.
At the joint request of the parties in dispute, and having regard to the need to
safeguard negotiating procedures, ACAS may appoint single arbitrators or
boards of arbitration to settle disputes on the basis of agreed terms of reference.
Alternatively ACAS may refer cases for arbitration to the Central Arbitration
Committee (see below). Some 395 joint requests for arbitration were made to
ACAS during 1979.
Although ACAS has prime responsibility for intervention in disputes, the
Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry or committee of
investigation into a dispute, whether existing or foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for attempt¬
ing conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee rights
(such as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal
Pay Act 1970 and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimi¬
nation Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976).
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed

inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also considers claims by indepen¬
dent trade unions that they should be recognised by an employer.
The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) is a permanent body for the
settlement of disputes by voluntary arbitration. Disputes may be referred to
the CAC by ACAS at the joint request of the employers and trade unions
concerned.
The committee is also called upon to arbitrate on claims made under various
Acts, including the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Employment Protection Act
1975, and acts as the independent tribunal to which the Secretary of State for
Employment refers questions relating to the payment of wages and conditions
of employment observed by Government contractors.
While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus¬
tries are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry,
there are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service unions and there is a highly
developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by means of the
National and Departmental Whitley Councils. Unresolved disputes may,
subject to certain limitations, be reported to the Secretary of State for reference
to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent body appointed by
the Secretary of State. Government industrial employees are similarly encour¬
aged to belong to trade unions and there is machinery for joint consulta¬
tion. Disputes on wages or conditions of employment that cannot be resolved
by the existing machinery can be referred to the Central Arbitration Com¬
mittee.
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as
other matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfac¬
tory arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with
their employees; the British Steel Corporation has appointed worker directors.
Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not usually members
of employers’ associations (although the majority are ‘public sector members’
of the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but even
where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road transport,
they are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local issues but not normally to
negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the facilities for
arbitration offered to industry generally by the ACAS, but coalmining and rail
transport have their own special arrangements. Consultation at all levels,
including the workplace, has been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which

negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as chairmen and members of
boards of nationalised industries, the higher judiciary and senior civil servants;
the armed forces; and doctors and dentists. It also services special inquiries on
particular pay structures and related problems.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
independent members. Wages councils publish proposals for minimum
remuneration, holidays, holiday remuneration and other terms and conditions
of employment. After considering any representations the councils make
orders giving statutory force to such proposals. The Department of
Employment’s Wages Inspectorate enforces the provisions of these wages
orders. About 2-7 million workers are covered by such arrangements.
The Secretary of State for Employment has power to convert a wages
council into a statutory joint industrial council (SJIC), a body which functions
in the same ways as a wages council, except that it has no independent
members. Such conversion is intended to assist in the development of collec¬
tive bargaining, an SJIC being seen as a half-way stage between the statutory
system and full voluntary collective bargaining.
Agricultural wages boards (there are boards for England and Wales, for
Scotland and for Northern Ireland) perform similar functions in relation to
employment in agriculture.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Employers have a duty at common and criminal law to take reasonable care of
their employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other and also to take care of their own safety. In
addition, minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of workplaces
or work are laid down under a number of statutes; some of these also deal with
health and welfare. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised
the system under which safety and health at work was safeguarded and
extended it to cover everyone at work and to further the protection of the
general public from industrial hazards.
The Health and Safety Commission, appointed by the Secretary of State for
Employment after consultation with the TUC, CBI and local authorities, has
responsibility for supervising the application and enforcement of health and
safety legislation. Its operational arm is the Health and Safety Executive,
consisting largely of the government inspectorates covering factories, mines
and quarries, agriculture, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works;
the Employment Medical Advisory Service; and the Health and Safety
Laboratories, which include the Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations may be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission, and by guidance notes and other codes.
In particular the Act gives inspectors the power to issue improvement and
prohibition notices, which enable them to require practical improvements to
be made within a specified time or to require preventive measures immediately

Other Measures

without first having to obtain a court order. There are provisions for appeals to
industrial tribunals against such notices.
About 207,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks
and construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is
enforced mainly by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety
Executive. Likewise about 770,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops
and Railway Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared by the Factory
Inspectorate, the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the Railway Inspectorate
(see below) and local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the
health, safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the
fencing of machinery; precautions against the exposure of people to toxic gases
and dusts; precautions against fire, dangerous substances and special risks; the
safe condition of premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventila¬
tion. They also contain provisions concerning the employment of women.
Anyone intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial premises
to which either the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises
Act applies has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention and there is a
statutory duty to report every accident which is either fatal or causes more than
three days’ incapacity. The Factories Act includes provisions for the compul¬
sory notification and investigation of certain types of dangerous occurrence.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quar¬
ries, agriculture and transport (including aviation and shipping, the responsi¬
bility of the Department of Trade). As with the Factories Act these other
provisions are, with some exceptions, enforced through inspectorates—the
Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the Agricultural Inspectorate, and the Rail¬
way Inspectorate of the Department of Transport. Safety requirements in all
other places of work including hotels, places of entertainment and educational
establishments but excluding domestic work in the home, are covered by the
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act or (in respect of their offices and shops) by
the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, while fire authorities are respon¬
sible for general fire precautions and means of escape.
The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear Installations Inspec¬
torate, is the authority concerned with the granting of nuclear site licences for
commercial nuclear installations. No such installation may be constructed or
operated in Britain without a licence granted by the executive under sections of
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 which are relevant statutory provisions
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Conditions attached to such
licences in the interests of safety are imposed and enforced by the inspectorate.
The Health and Safety Commission also has responsibility under the Min¬
eral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and the Petroleum and Sub¬
marine Pipelines Act 1975 for the health and safety of all workers (including
divers) engaged in the offshore oil and gas industry, by agency agreement with
the Petroleum Engineering Directorate, Department of Energy.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of
standards of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in safety
awareness.
To minimise the hazards which may arise from the use of pesticides, a

voluntary scheme has been established under which pesticides are vetted by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Advisory Committee on
Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals (see p 184) before being marketed. The
committee gives clearance for specific uses, subject to its recommendations on
such matters as safety precautions and labelling being agreed to.
There are also the Health and Safety Laboratories, which are concerned
with research into health and safety problems in industry (see p 390).
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached
the statutory minimum school-leaving age (16); of women and young people
underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women
in factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also limits and
defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young people.
The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of voluntary
central organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration
of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its
inspectorates, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety aspects of
machine design and specification, circulate expert advice to both sides of
industry and to the general public. Recognised trade unions may appoint safety
representatives to represent the employees in a workplace; also, two or more
such representatives may make a written request to the employer to establish a
safety committee, which must then be set up within three months.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being superseded. The Health and Safety Commission has
appointed three subject advisory committees (on dangerous substances, toxic
substances and medical matters), two committees concerned with particular
hazards (major hazards and nuclear installations) and nine industry advisory
committees (for agriculture, ceramics, construction, foundries, oil, paper and
board, printing, railways and health services). The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are national
bodies concerned with accident prevention and sponsor a number of local
accident prevention groups.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Manpower Services
Commission provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its Training
Within Industry scheme (see p 332). The industrial training boards include
specific provisions for safety training in their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs, mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham, and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing and organising conferences; its regional
industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-level
managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses. Other
courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisations
such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems
of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, nuclear
safety, protective personal equipment, construction methods, explosions and
fires, psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in

particular sectors of industry. Industrial research associations include among ;
their more purely economic research projects the improvement of working I
conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a
direct bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a
statutory responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal 1
miners, largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The University of Aston in Birmingham runs degree and diploma courses
for the training of safety officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned
with the technical aspects of insurance and forensic work.
The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), part of the Health and
Safety Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical j
aspects of employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, |
doctors and others. It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazard¬
ous occupations and surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the
Manpower Services Commission on medical aspects of job placement,
rehabilitation and industrial training and co-operates with school medical
officers and careers officers in helping to solve the employment problems of
handicapped school leavers. The service, headed by the Health and Safety
Executive’s Director of Medical Services, has over 100 employment medical
advisers based in the country’s main industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI
and other interested organisations are associated with the work of the service
through advisory committees.
The Occupational Medicine and Hygiene Laboratories (which are part of the
Health and Safety Laboratories, see p 343) at Cricklewood, north London,
provide laboratory services and undertake research in the field of occupational
health. The Factory Inspectorate also looks to the laboratories as a main source
of laboratory assistance.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social j
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspec¬
torate, which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAS.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
over and above the statutory requirements. The big employers, including the
State and the boards of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a'
number of smaller factories also provide medical services and in a few cases i
have joined together in group medical services.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational
facilities. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent
homes. The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has
become usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many
offices and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff
have adopted luncheon voucher schemes.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. Official research has sought to extend the
available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations in industry and i

human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by the Social
Science Research Council (see p 385) and the Medical Research Council (see
p 383). In addition, the Department of Employment’s Work Research Unit
provides information on how particular jobs can be redesigned to create greater
satisfaction, helps industry and others in initiating and evaluating changes in
the content of work, and administers a research programme. Voluntary organ¬
isations include bodies which deal with management problems and provide a
service to subscribing firms; professional associations, linking individuals with
a common interest in particular functions of management; and bodies provid¬
ing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
protected by legislation in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 and the
Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number of firms
voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups, supported by
representatives of industry, insurance companies and public authorities, make
a valuable contribution to accident prevention.
The Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978, which came into force
early in 1979, extends health and safety legislation to all people at work except
domestic workers in private employment. A Health and Safety Agency,
roughly corresponding to the Health and Safety Commission, and an
Employment Medical Advisory Service have been set up under the legislation.
18 Finance
PUBLIC
EXPENDITURE
Through the public finance system the Government raises money from
individuals and companies by taxation, borrowing and other means, and
spends it on behalf of the community in the provision of goods and services
such as education, health and defence, in payments to people and organisa¬
tions, and in capital investment. The term public finance also covers the
raising of revenue and its expenditure by local authorities and certain other
public bodies and the financial relationship between these agencies and the
central Government.
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditure of central
government and local authorities (collectively known as general government),
excluding expenditure charged to the operating account of trading bodies;
central government finance in the form of grants, loans or public dividend
capital provided towards the cost of capital investment by the nationalised
industries; the capital expenditure of other public corporations; the conting¬
ency reserve; and those debt interest payments which constitute a charge on
taxation. Public expenditure, excluding the contingency reserve and debt
interest, in 1979-80 amounted to nearly £72,000 million (at 1979 survey
prices) of which 73 per cent was undertaken by the central Government and 26
per cent by local authorities, the remaining 1 per cent representing the capital
expenditure of certain public corporations other than the nationalised indus¬
tries. The social services programmes accounted for over 52 per cent of the
total programmes, and defence expenditure for about 11 per cent. The wide
range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its distribution is
shown in Table 28.
Out of the total public expenditure of £75,100 million in 1979-80 some
£39,210 million or 52 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and value of the physical
increase in stocks and work in progress). Transfer payments to individuals,
companies and other institutions in the private sector (for example, social
security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt interest) made up the
balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of goods and services,
transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on the nation’s resources.
The gross sums transferred create a proportionately lower indirect demand
for goods and services because of taxes paid and savings made by the
recipients.
Between 1974-75 and 1979-80 total public expenditure grew in real terms
by nearly 5 per cent, but it is expected to fall progressively over the next few
years in accordance with the Government’s policy of reducing the claim of the
public sector on national resources.

Major importance is attached to adequate planning and control of public
expenditure. Planning is undertaken in the annual public expenditure survey,
which leads to the publication of a document setting out the Government’s
plans for public expenditure over the next few years. Control is exercised
through the Supply Estimates and cash limits. (Cash limits, see below, are
derived from the plans decided in the public expenditure survey; they are not
normally exceeded.) Effective control requires up-to-date information on the
progress of expenditure, achieved through monitoring by the Treasury or
other departments. These arrangements are described in more detail below.

Differences between totals and the sums of their constituent parts are due to rounding.
Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure.
This covers the expected outturn for the current year and plans for the next
three (until recently four) years.
The survey starts with a revaluation of the plans published in the previous
report to a new constant price level (broadly, prices in the autumn of the
preceding year). Proposals for changes in the existing plans are then brought
together in order to provide ministers with a basis for decisions about the total
and the composition of public expenditure in the period covered. This gives
the Government the opportunity to plan any necessary changes without caus¬
ing wasteful disruption in services, and to have regard to the general economic
outlook when taking decisions.

A report on the survey is prepared in the first half of the year. This is
followed by ministerial consideration of the report and then by the publication
of the Government’s public expenditure plans (see Bibliography) early in the
following year. This provides the basis for an annual public expenditure debate
in the House of Commons. The plans contain a contingency reserve to provide
for additions to the programmes set out. Since 1976 this has been developed
into a more operational instrument, as one of the means of securing that actual
expenditure is kept within the plans. The object is, as far as possible, to limit
claims on the reserve by meeting the cost of new measures, or increased
estimates for existing measures, within existing departmental totals. Recourse
to the reserve to meet additional expenditure is subject to the approval of
Treasury ministers, who may refer the larger or more difficult claims for
consideration by the Cabinet.
In December each department submits its cash requirements for the financial
year beginning on the following 1 April to the Treasury. Estimates cover
central Government’s own expenditure. (Not all this expenditure is classified
as public expenditure—for example, payments to local authorities. Only when
the money is spent by the local authorities is public expenditure recorded.)
After they have been approved by the Treasury, the Supply Estimates are
presented to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see p 350) and are approved
by Parliament by means of an annual Appropriation Act in July (expenditure
to this date from 1 April is covered by a Vote on Account approved by
Parliament before the beginning of the financial year). There are 29 allotted
days (known as supply days) in each session on which the choice of subject for
debate rests with the Opposition and on which estimates can be debated. Broad
issues of policy are normally discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts of
Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges.
The Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are
paid, finances most of the central Government’s expenditure; its balance
is the Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans
Fund covers most of the central Government’s domestic lending and
borrowing, and is operated as an official account at the Bank of England. The
two funds deal only with sterling receipts and payments; official dealings
in foreign exchange are carried out by the Exchange Equalisation Account
(see p 357).
Cash limits, first introduced on an extensive scale in 1976-77, have been
applied to public spending wherever they can make a useful contribution to
financial discipline. They also contribute to the Government’s policy for
reducing inflation and help in forecasting the Government’s maximum finan¬
cing requirements. To simplify the control of expenditure, the cash limits and
those parts of the Supply Estimates to which they apply (accounting for about
two-thirds of public expenditure) are presented in assimilated form. This has
the advantage of making the Supply Estimates an effective control mechanism
and subjects cash limits to parliamentary control. Spending departments and
authorities are required to provide within their cash limits for increases in costs
due to pay and price changes so there is no guarantee that the planned level of
expenditure in real terms can be achieved.

Certain services such as social security payments are excluded because, once
policy and rates of payment have been determined, cash spending in the short
term depends on factors outside the Government’s direct control such as the
number of claimants. Local authority spending which is financed from local
taxation (the rates, see p 66) is also outside the scope of cash limits, which apply
only to central government expenditure. Financial assistance given by the
central government to local authorities in the form of rate support grants (see
p 65) comes from funds on which cash limits have been placed. Cash limits
are also placed on local authority capital expenditure, which is financed by
borrowing from the National Loans Fund. The estimates of the financing
requirements of the nationalised industries are treated as a form of cash
limit.
Expenditure by government departments is monitored by the Treasury and
compared with profiles of expected expenditure prepared at the beginning of
the financial year in accordance with the approved Public Expenditure Survey,
Supply Estimate and cash limit provisions.
This process has been improved in recent years through the introduction of a
computerised financial information system for both the Treasury and for
spending departments.
Parliamentary control of public expenditure is exercised not only through
approval of the Supply Estimates but also through the work of the Comptroller
and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and the House of
Commons Select Committee on the Treasury and the Civil Service.
The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Crown and
his independence of the Executive is secured by specific statutory pro¬
visions.
He has two functions: as Comptroller General he exercises his statutory
duty to ensure that all revenue and other public moneys payable to the
Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund are duly paid over and that
all issues from these funds are authorised by statute; and as Auditor General,
and in accordance with the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts and the
National Loans Act 1968, he audits, on behalf of the House of Commons,
accounts of the transactions of the Consolidated Fund and National Loans
Fund and every Appropriation Account, and submits his reports on them and
other accounts to Parliament. For many years and with the encouragement of
the Public Accounts Committee his statutory audit functions have been inter¬
preted widely and his reports regularly examine and criticise matters of general
financial administration, cost-effectiveness and cases of apparent waste or
extravagance.
The Government has been reviewing the Exchequer and Audit Depart¬
ments Acts and has issued a consultative document The Role of the Comptroller
and Auditor General in order to carry forward its review. (See Bibliography.)
A new structure of House of Commons Select Committees was established in
I979 (see also P 33)* There are 14 committees which examine the expenditure
(as well as the administration and policy) of the principal government depart¬
ments. The objective of the new structure is to strengthen the accountability of
ministers to the House of Commons and, to this end, the Government makes
available to the select committees as much information as possible, including
confidential information.

THE BUDGET
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The accounts of each department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General upon them are considered by a House of Commons Select
Committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was established in
1861 to ensure that expenditure was only incurred in accordance with the
purposes for which it was voted and with the relevant Acts of Parliament. The
Committee’s terms of reference are simply that it must examine and report
upon the accounts laid before Parliament but these terms are widely inter¬
preted. Successive committees have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have reported in detail on
cases in which administration appeared faulty or negligent. The Committee
has become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste or inefficiency and
it embodies its findings in regular reports to Parliament. Although the
Committee has no executive powers its reports to Parliament carry consider¬
able weight and its recommendations are taken very seriously by departments
and organisations that it examines. The Government’s formal reply to these
reports is presented to Parliament by the Treasury in the form of a Treasury
Minute, and the reports and the Minute are made the subject of an annual
debate in the House of Commons.
The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts) is a
set of proposals, usually put. forward in March or April, for financing govern- |
ment expenditure and managing the economy. Supplementary budgetary
measures may also be introduced at other times of the year. The proposals are
described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against
the background of a statement on Britain and the world economy, the
Government’s past and prospective revenue and expenditure, and an assess¬
ment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means (or
Budget) resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions,
when passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic
management, and the Budget statement is normally the main occasion for a
review of general economic policy. The Budget is therefore concerned with the
balance between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available
to the nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Through
taxation the Government can exert a considerable influence on the volume of
demand for goods and services; its measures can also have a broader influence
on the pattern of demand and, through, for instance, increasing incentives, on
the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On
occasions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and
family allowances, have been announced in the Budget statement, as have
financial and monetary measures, such as changes in exchange control policies.
Such measures, however, are not generally reflected in the resolutions or the
Finance Act but are applied by the appropriate procedure, that is, separate
legislation, statutory instruments or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at his disposal, and especially by
FINANCE

increasing or reducing the yield of central government taxes. The tax changes
proposed on the basis of the Budget judgment are enacted in the form
approved by Parliament in the Finance Act, which also provides the annual
opportunity for non-budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain
other financial matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrow¬

The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates of coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery
relating to taxation. In two cases (income tax and corporation tax), how¬
ever, annual Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are
necessary to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual
taxes. Thus a Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year is a
necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
law, do not come into effect until the appropriate Bill—in this case the Finance
Bill—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget, normally
about the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill. Some
changes, however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or from
the start of the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act. This
enables the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income tax, for
example, either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates following
the passing of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions. Other ways of
changing taxation are by special legislation or the use of the regulator, which
permits limited changes between Budgets in the rates of value added tax (by up
to 25 per cent) and the main groups of excise duties (by up to 10 per cent).
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography) which is laid before
the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he presents
the Budget. The report is in five parts: the Budget proposals; the medium-
term financial strategy; the economic context of the Budget; the accounts of
the public sector for the past financial year and the one immediately ahead; and
the accounts of the central Government for the same two years. The accounts
are designed to assist in assessing the impact of changes in revenue and public
expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public
corporations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents, therefore,
the borrowing which is required by the public sector from the private and
overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
To raise the money it requires over and above tax revenue and other receipts
the Government offers a great variety of claims on itself designed to attract
different types of lender. Broadly there is marketable debt and non-marketable
debt. Marketable debt is made up of short-term floating debt consisting of
Treasury bills, and funded or longer-term debt made up of government
securities which are of varying maturities and publicly quoted on the Stock

Exchange. Non-marketable debt comprises the various forms of national
savings designed to attract the smaller saver; certificates of tax deposits;1 and
ways and means advances, which basically are very short-term internal
government borrowing. The bulk of public corporations’ borrowing is met by
central government through the National Loans Fund, although public
corporations’ temporary borrowing needs are met largely from the market
under Treasury guarantee. That part of local authority borrowing met by
central government is dealt with through the National Investment and Loans
Office (set up in April 1980 as a result of the merger of the Public Works Loan
Board and the National Debt Office) which has recourse to the National Loans
Fund. The local authorities also borrow directly from the market, both short¬
term and long-term, through a range of different investments. Some public
corporations and local authorities also borrow, under special statutory power
and with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
After allowing for the changes introduced by the 1980 Budget the central
government’s borrowing requirement for 1980—81 was expected to be £9>3I3
million, compared with an estimated outturn of £8,227 million in 1979—80,
and that for the public sector as a whole £8,536 million, compared with an
estimated £9,795 million in 1979-80.
Table 29 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources in 1979-80
and the forecasts for 1980-81 together with the effects of the Budget changes.
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which
include capital transfer tax and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expendi¬
ture (including taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets), which include
protective and excise duties, value added tax (VAT), the National Insurance
Surcharge, local rates (see p 66), stamp duties and licence duties (for example,
on motor vehicles). Taxes on individual incomes are progressive in that larger
incomes bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of Inland
Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the
stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the most important
taxes on expenditure (the customs and excise duties and VAT) while a
variety of authorities is responsible for the collection of the remainder. The
Government has begun to shift the emphasis from taxes on income to taxes on
expenditure.
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. The
Finance Act 1980 abolished the lower rate band of 25 per cent for the first £750
of taxable income (total income less personal and other allowances) and altered
the bands applicable to the other rates. The basic rate of 30 per cent now
applies to the first £11,250 of taxable income. A rate of 40 per cent applies to
the £n,25i-£i3,25o band of taxable income, 45 per cent to the
£i3,25i-£i6,750 band, 50 per cent to the £i6,75i-£22,25o band and 55 per
cent to the £22,251-£27,750 band, ending with a maximum rate of 60 per cent
on taxable income over £27,750. These rates apply to both earned and invest¬
ment incomes. Investment incomes are also liable to a surcharge of 15 per cent
on their excess over £5,500. The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by
means of personal allowances and reliefs. In general the income of married

couples is taxed as one but the married man’s allowance is higher than the
single person’s. A husband and wife may choose to have the wife’s earnings
charged separately for tax on condition that the husband receives the single
instead of the married personal allowance. Even then they are taxed jointly on
any investment income.
For 1980—81 a single person earning £5,000 a year pays £1,087 in income tax
while a married man with the same earned income pays £856. The amount of
tax payable by a single person varies from, for example, £37 on an earned
annual income of £1,500 to £12,050 on one of £30,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in Britain
and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in Britain. Interest on
certain British government securities belonging to persons not ordinarily
resident in Britain is exempt. Britain has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is allowed.
Companies pay corporation tax on all their profits, whether distributed or not.
Only a proportion of any capital gains is included in total profits, with the
result that chargeable gains as a whole are subject to a lower effective rate of
tax. Income tax is not deducted from dividends but a company which distri¬
butes profits to its shareholders is required to make to the Inland Revenue an
advance payment of corporation tax. In general, this payment is set against a
company’s corporation tax bill and the recipient of the distribution in respect of
which the advance payment was made is entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies
his or her liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for the financial year 1979 (1 April 1979-31 March 1980) it is 52
per cent with a reduced rate of 40 per cent for small companies (such com¬
panies being defined in the relevant Finance Act). The tax is assessed on the
profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the financial year
in which the accounting period falls. Where an accounting period straddles 31
March the profits are apportioned on a time basis. Relief is given by an interim
scheme for the rise in the value of stocks and work in progress between the
beginning and the end of the accounting period. The Government is to consult
with the accountancy profession and others on possible permanent scheme of
relief following the profession’s recent proposals for a system of inflation
accounting. A consultative document is to be published reporting the results of
the Government’s general review of the present corporation tax provisions.
Meanwhile deferred tax liability arising from stock relief for 1973-74 and
1974-75 has been written off. Outstanding relief for each subsequent year will
also be written off after a six-year interval.
As part of its policy for encouraging small businesses, the Government has
raised the qualifying profits limits for the small companies rate of corporation
tax to £70,000 for full relief and £130,000 for marginal relief.
Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax (deducted in
computing profits for corporation tax) is charged on profits from the winning,!
as opposed to refining or other form of processing, of hydrocarbons unde^
licence in Britain and on its continental shelf. In 1980 the tax was raised from

60 per cent to 70 per cent. Each licensee of an oilfield is charged on the profits
for that field, computed for half-yearly periods. The Petroleum Revenue Tax
Act 1980 provides for payments of the tax in advance of assessment for liability.
A comprehensive tax, capital transfer tax, applies to transfer of personal wealth
in three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers relating to
settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is chargeable in
respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a cumulative basis.
The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property ‘passing’ on an
assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased’s estate immediately before the
death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on successive slices
of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower scale of tax for
lifetime transfers than for transfers on death. The higher scale applies to
transfers made on death or up to three years before the transferer’s death.
Under both scales the first £50,000 of transfers is exempt. The rates on
amounts over this figure rise from 30 per cent (higher scale) and 15 per cent
(lower scale) on the slice between £50,000 and £60,000 to 75 per cent (both
scales) on the excess over £2-01 million.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax or,
in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally 30 per
cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their circum¬
stances. For small businesses the tax on gifts and certain deemed disposals of
business assets may be deferred until the assets are sold. Certain assets may be
exempt from tax, including the principal private residence, chattels worth less
than £2,000 (and any chattels, except those used for the purpose of a trade,
with a predictable life of less than 50 years), private motor cars and National
Savings Certificates. An individual is exempt from capital gains tax where the
total net gains do not exceed £3,000 in any year. The excess over this amount is
chargeable at a rate of 30 per cent. Gains on government securities are exempt
from the tax if they have been held for more than 12 months.
The Development Land Tax Act 1976 introduced a development land tax
(DLT) on development value in place of the charge on development gains and
on first letting introduced in the Finance Act 1974. Any assessable develop¬
ment value raised on the disposal of an interest in land is chargeable to DLT at
the rate of 60 per cent but the first £50,000 of any such development value
realised in any financial year is completely exempt. Exemptions from DLT
include the sale or development of owner-occupied residences.
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly-based tax, currently chargeable at 15 per
cent. It is collected at each stage in the production and distribution of goods
and services by taxable persons (generally a person carrying on a business with
a turnover of more than £13,500 a year). The final tax is borne by the
consumer. The taxable person is charged by suppliers of goods and services
with VAT (input tax) who then charges the customer with VAT on goods and
services supplied (output tax). It is the difference between output and input
tax that is paid to Customs and Excise.
There are two methods by which certain goods and services are relieved
from VAT: one is by charging VAT at a zero rate (a taxable person does not
charge tax to a customer but reclaims any input tax paid to suppliers); the other
is by exemption (a taxable person does not charge a customer any output tax
and is not entitled to deduct or reclaim the input tax). Zero-rating applies to

most types of food (except in the course of catering); books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for road use); construction
of buildings; exports; public transport fares; young children’s clothing and
footwear; and drugs and medicines supplied on prescription. Exemption
applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal services, betting, gaming
other than by gaming machines and lotteries, finance, education, health, and
burial and cremation.
These are chargeable as customs duties in accordance with the Common
Customs Tariff of the European Community (no such duties are chargeable on
goods which qualify as Community goods). Special customs import and export
procedures are operated under the common agricultural policy and community
levies are chargeable on a wide range of agricultural products from non¬
community countries.
Oils used for road fuel bear duty at the basic rate. Heavy oil not used for road
fuel and light oil used for furnace fuel bear a lower duty and are zero-rated for
VAT. Oil used as chemical feedstocks or otherwise than as a fuel or lubricant in
manufacturing is relieved from the duty.
There are duties on spirits, beer, wine, madewine, cider and perry. Each is
related to the alcoholic strength of the particular drink except for beer, where
the rate of duty depends on the original gravity of the worts.
The cigarette duty is based partly on a charge per 1,000 cigarettes and partly
on a percentage of retail price. Duty on other tobacco products is based on the
weight of the finished product.
The principal betting duties are the general betting duty, which is charged
at a rate of 7-5 per cent of the stake money, except for on-course betting,
which is charged at 4 per cent; pool betting duty (which applies to football
pools), charged at a rate of 40 per cent of the stake money; and bingo duty,
charged at per cent. Casino gaming machines are taxed mainly by licence
duties.
The licence duty on a private motor car is £60 a year; motor cycles and three
wheel vehicles etc., pay £6, £12 or £24 a year according to engine capacity.
Goods vehicles are taxed by unladen weight and taxis and buses are taxed by
seating capacity.
New cars and motor caravans, whether British made or imported, are charge¬
able with car tax at 10 per cent on the wholesale value.VAT falls on the price
including car tax.
Transfers of property (other than of stocks and shares, which are liable to duty
at 2 per cent) up to a value of £20,000 are exempt from stamp duty. Above this
threshold stamp duty is chargeable at rates of 0-5 per cent, 1 per cent and 1-5
per cent on transfers valued up to £25,000, £30,000 and £35,000, respectively,
with the full rate of 2 per cent applying to values above £35,000.
The national insurance surcharge took effect from the start of the 1977-78
financial year. It is in the form of a levy paid by employers, along with their
national insurance contributions, in respect of their employees and is equal to
3-5 per cent of employees’ earnings up to £165 per week (earnings of less than
£23 per week are exempt from the surcharge). Generally it is assumed that the
incidence of this tax will be passed forward into prices, so that it ranks as a tax
on expenditure.

On 31 March 1980 the total National Debt was estimated at £95,330 million, of
which £3,950 million was repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to
the United States Government. Of the £91,380 million of internal debt, £9,740
million was floating debt, while the long-term loans included a variety of
stocks, bonds, loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest and with
fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment. The National Debt relates only to
the liabilities of the National Loans Fund (see p 352) which includes official
holdings of central government debt by other central government funds.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in Great Britain. The major sources of
revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United Kingdom Parlia¬
ment over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of the yield of
United Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United
Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues from local
resources such as the regional rate and from certain non-tax revenue. There is
also an annual grant-in-aid voted by Parliament (£590 million in 1979-80
which, together with the attributed share of United Kingdom taxes, rates and
miscellaneous sums, amounted to £1,858 million). Loans from the United
Kingdom National Loans Fund are available (up to a limit of £1,000 million) to
finance capital expenditure programmes in Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
follow the pattern for Great Britain, the principal funds being those relating to
national insurance, and government loans. The latter constitutes a pool of
money available mainly for local and public authority borrowers; on 31 March
1980 a sum of £338 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services: the National Girobank; the British
offices of domestic and overseas banks whose main business is in other
countries; merchant banks; and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank, the
Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
deposit banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system; it is the
note-issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised
industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth government
stocks. On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange Equalisation
Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign
exchange, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International Monetary
Fund and European Currency Units (ECUs). Using the resources of the EEA,
the Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue
fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling and to conserve the means of
making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government, the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations in
the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently it has a
35^
The Deposit

major responsibility for advising the Government on the formulation of
monetary policy and for its subsequent execution. It is also the main channel of
communication between the deposit banks and other financial institutions of
the City of London on the one hand and the Government on the other.
The Bank’s implementation of monetary policy is carried out primarily
through control over interest rates although the banking system is subject to a
number of more direct controls. The Bank administers directly the official
discount rate, known as Minimum Lending Rate (MLR), which is the rate at
which the Bank will normally provide funds to the discount market as a lender
of last resort. MLR in turn can be expected to have an influence on other
short-term interest rates. In addition, the authorities can influence interest
rates through their daily operations in the money market and the terms on
which they offer gilt-edged stock.
The Bank’s direct controls over the banking system include the requirement
that banks hold specified assets in minimum ratio to total eligible liabilities
(broadly, sterling deposits drawn from outside the banking system). A number
of changes to these requirements have been proposed in the Government’s
report on Monetary Control (see Bibliography) published in March 1980. The
timetable of the changes will depend in part on discussion with the banks about
new prudential and other requirements following the introduction of the
Banking Act 1979. The Bank of England has also issued qualitative guidance
on the direction of bank lending; this provides for priority to be given to the
finance required by manufacturing industry, for the expansion of exports and
for import saving.
Under the Banking Act 1979 all deposit-taking businesses which are not
specifically excluded require authorisation from the Bank of England and are
subject to its continuing supervision. Authorisation may take the form either of
recognition as a bank or of a licence to take deposits. The Act also set up a
deposit protection scheme to project the funds of depositors.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by gold
but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern Ireland
banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount
specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by holdings of
Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation is the responsi¬
bility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London and
two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also
operate in Northern Ireland.
In July 1980 sterling sight and time deposits with these banks from non-bank
customers in the British public and private sectors amounted to £34,160
million and accounted for 66 per cent of the total of such deposits with all banks
in Britain, that is including the accepting houses, overseas banks, consortium
banks, the National Girobank and other British banks. Sight deposits are
repayable on demand and no interest is generally paid on them, but on time
deposits interest is paid (at a rate below individual banks’ base rates). The
deposit banks provide full banking services throughout Britain, and operate
through some 14,000 branches. Several of them have interests in British
FINANCE

overseas and Commonwealth banks, and in other banks which have been
formed specially to compete in international markets. They have also acquired
substantial interests in hire-purchase finance houses, and some have set up
their own unit trusts and merchant banks.
The deposit banks’ main liquid assets consist of balances at the Bank of
England, money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), their holdings of
Treasury and some other bills and short-dated British government securities.
The banks also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio (mainly longer-
dated British government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers,
partly in the form of overdrafts1 and partly in the form of loans (with or without
collateral security). In July 1980 sterling advances by the London clearing
banks amounted to 74 per cent of their sterling deposits.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting by which a
creditor with a prior approval of the debtor may claim money due to him direct
from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the money transmis¬
sion services. An increasing number of banks have automatic cash dispensing
machines and many are also introducing more automated banking facilities.
Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement of accounts in retail
shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a cheque up to a
specified credit limit at any office of major British and Irish banks and at offices
of many banks overseas.
Membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House, which deals with the
clearing of cheques and drafts, consists of the Bank of England and the London
clearing banks, together with the Co-operative Bank and the Central Trustee
Savings Bank, which became members in 1975. In 1979 cheques and drafts
worth over £3,615,000 million passed through the London clearing system.
The Post Office National Girobank (known as National Giro until 1978),
which was introduced in 1968 to provide a low-cost current account banking
and money transfer service, is operated through more than 20,000 post offices
in Britain. All accounts and transactions are maintained by means of a com¬
puter complex at Bootle, Merseyside. In March 1980 Girobank had 820,000
accounts with balances of over £400 million. The number of transactions has
risen from an annual rate of 80 million in March 1969 to one of about 300
million in March 1980. In addition to its services to individuals, Girobank’s
services to commerce, industry and the public utilities include a facility
whereby organisations with dispersed branches, depots and representatives
can rapidly channel receipts into their central account. Some 165 local
authorities as well as voluntary housing associations use Girobank’s rent
collection services. Girobank’s international services also provide money trans¬
fer facilities linking over 19 million account holders in the European Com¬
munity and other countries.
The range of banking services provided by Girobank includes current
accounts, personal loans, a cheque guarantee card, limited overdrawing
for personal customers and overdrafts for corporate customers, deposit
accounts, budget accounts, bridging loans, travellers’ cheques and foreign
currency, bureaux de change and a facility to draw cash at 80,000 post offices
in Europe.

were developed to cover fluctuating working capital requirements.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Altogether 430 overseas banks and financial institutions were represented in
London in 1980 through branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and
consortia. There were 380 banks directly represented in London, while 50
banks and financial institutions were represented through a stake in one or
more of the 26 joint venture banks operating in London. Of those directly
represented, 75 were from the United States, 25 from Japan and 115 from
Europe, of which 55 were from the European Community. They provide a
comprehensive banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the
financing of trade not only between Britain and other countries but also
between third countries.
Merchant banks have traditionally been primarily concerned with acceptance
credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their customers.
Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activities with an
important role in international finance and the short-term capital markets, the
provision of expert advice and financial services to British industrial companies
especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of corporate reorganisa¬
tion are involved, and in the management of investment holdings, including
trusts, pensions and other funds.
The discount market is an institution which is unique to the City of London.
Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mechanism
designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market consists
of n discount houses, five money traders, six Stock Exchange money brokers
and two discount brokers, all of which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice
and lend for somewhat longer periods. The discount houses have recourse to
the Bank of England as lender of last resort. The Bank lends to them generally
overnight or for up to seven days at Minimum Lending Rate, although it may
charge a higher rate. Most of the market’s borrowed funds come from the
banks, which are thus provided with a flexible means of earning a yield on
surplus funds which they have at any given time.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer¬
cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
of deposit denominated in both sterling and United States dollars. The dis¬
count houses accept as a formal responsibility that they should cover the
government’s need to borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender
each week.
The Department for National Savings is responsible for the administration of
government savings schemes: National Savings Bank accounts, National
Savings Certificates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds and
Save As You Earn contracts. Government policy is directed towards encourag¬
ing investment, primarily of personal savings, in these schemes, particularly as
they represent a major source of funds for financing the public sector borrow¬
ing requirement. At April 1980 National Savings totalled £13,550 million.
Facilities are provided by National Savings for the purchase of government
stocks (‘gilts’); a selection of about 50 stocks is held on the National Savings
Stock Register. Gift tokens are also available at most post offices.
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports from, and
imports to, Britain and other markets. The term is derived from the method of financing trade by
which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or guaranteed by a merchant bank against documents, after
which they may be discounted for cash by a discount house or other intermediary.

The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings at post offices. There are about 21 million active
accounts. Ordinary Accounts bear interest at 5 per cent and the first £70 of
annual interest is tax-free. Up to £100 can be withdrawn on demand at any
savings bank post office, but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts.
The money is lodged with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested in
government securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest may be made
in Investment Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee. At the
end of April 1980 the sum of the two accounts totalled some £3,440 million.
National Savings Certificates, in units of £10, are encashable at par at any time.
Interest, which is free of income tax and capital gains tax, is paid only on
encashment. The maximum permitted holding of the current Nineteenth
Issue is £1,500. National Savings Certificates (second index-linked issue) are
available only to those aged 60 and over at £10 for each one unit certificate.
Interest does not accrue periodically but instead, subject to the certificate
being held for one year, the repayment value is related to the movement of the
general index of retail prices. If held for five years a bonus of 4 per cent of the
purchase price is added to the repayment value. The maximum permitted
holding is £3,000.
The sale of British Savings Bonds ceased at the end of 1979. Bonds bought
before then may be held to maturity at five years.
Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 (minimum purchase is £5) and
individual holdings are limited to £10,000. After a qualifying period of three
months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes. There is a
weekly draw for prizes of £100,000, £50,000 and £25,000 and a monthly draw
offering thousands of prizes ranging in value from £50 to £250,000. Total net
sales of bonds to April 1980 were some £1,410 million.
The Third Issue of the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme introduced in 1975
is index-linked. The scheme enables savings to be made in fixed regular
monthly amounts over five years, with a minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20
(to be raised to £50 in 1981), by means of deductions from pay or by other
regular payments. At the end of five years, the repayment value is the total
contributions plus any increase due to index-linking of monthly contributions.
Completed savings which are not- withdrawn qualify for fresh index-linking
and a bonus equal to two monthly contributions at the end of seven years.
Savers who wish to stop payments are able to withdraw the total sum saved
(but there cannot be partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest is then
paid at the rate of 6 per cent a year on amounts withdrawn after the first year.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates on similar terms
to National Savings Certificates.
The Trustee Savings Banks (TSBs), most of which were founded in the
nineteenth century, operate under their own trustees but are subject, under
the Trustee Savings Banks Acts 1969, 1976 and 1978, to the supervision
of the Trustee Savings Banks Central Board and the Treasury. Following a
planned programme of amalgamations, there were 17 individual banks in
June 1980 (compared with 67 in 1975) with about 1,640 branches, 14
million accounts and total deposits in excess of £5,300 million. The 1976 Act

empowered TSBs to provide a full range of banking services including credit
services. The TSB credit services include personal loans, temporary over¬
drafts, bridging loans, mortgages and home improvement loans. The TSBs
also have their own credit card, Trustcard, which operates within the VISA
system. In addition, a range of life assurance and unit trust facilities are
available. The TSBs are also in the process of introducing a national scheme
for small scale commercial lending including overdrafts up to one year and
medium term loans up to ten years.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include institutions providing credit in specialised forms, such
as hire purchase finance companies, and leasing and factoring companies;
institutions which manage investments on behalf of the public, such as pension
funds, life assurance companies, unit trusts and investment trusts; institutions
which provide financial services, such as the Stock Exchange, with its associ¬
ated stockbrokers; commodity markets; and the insurance market; and inter¬
mediaries which are less dependent on the financial markets in the City of
London, such as building societies and credit unions.
Although there are a large number of firms engaged in the financing of hire
purchase and other instalment credit transactions, about 85 per cent of all
finance house business is accounted for by the 40 firms which constitute the
Finance Houses Association (FHA). At the end of June 1980 the value of
credit outstanding to the members of FHA amounted to £7,130 million. A
substantial amount of new credit extended by finance houses related to cars
and commercial vehicles, including motorcycles and caravans, the remainder
relating to industrial and building equipment and other goods.
The leading finance houses comply with the authorities’ policies on lending
similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses are required to observe
term controls affecting the minimum deposits and maximum repayment
period for specific goods financed by certain forms of lending.
Leasing companies buy and own plant or equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental. This form of finance is growing in
importance, partly because the leasing companies can take advantage of
investment incentives to the benefit of customers whose tax position would
otherwise make them unavailable. In 1979 new assets leased by the 55 mem¬
bers of the Equipment Leasing Association amounted to £1,800 million, some
11 per cent of British investment in capital equipment.
Factoring companies purchase the trade debts due to a business and provide an
accounting and debt collection service. The services available cover exports
from and imports to Britain, as well as domestic trade. In 1978 the eight
members of the Association of British Factors handled about £1,340 million
worth of turnover.
Finance corporations meet the need for medium- and long-term capital when
such funds are not easily or directly available from traditional sources such as
the Stock Exchange or the banks.
Finance for Industry Limited (FFI) was formed in 1973 as the holding
company for two previously separate but related corporations, the Finance
Corporation for Industry (FCI) and the Industrial and Commercial Finance
FINANCE
The Crown
Agents

Corporation (ICFC). The purpose of the merger was to provide, in one
specialist financial institution, the capacity to support investment programmes
over the whole range of industry. The FCI provides medium-term funds at
fixed and variable interest rates for large companies in excess of £2 million.
During the year ended 31 March 1980 it advanced a total of £45 million and had
commitments and guarantees at the end of the year of a further £44 million.
The ICFC provides medium- and long-term funds at fixed interest rates for
the small and medium sectors of industry. At the end of March 1980 the ICFC
had gross facilities outstanding of £380 million in 3,340 companies. Its normal
lending limits range from £5,000 to £2 million for periods between seven and
20 years. The shares in FFI are owned by the Bank of England (15 per cent)
and the individual London and Scottish clearing banks.
Equity Capital for Industry Ltd (ECI) was formed in 1976 as a new
specialist long-term institution with the primary purpose of providing equity
or equity-type capital for industry in Britain which cannot appropriately be
provided through the normal market mechanism. Its authorised capital is £50
million and the shares are largely held by insurance companies and life offices,
investment trust companies, unit trusts and FFI. There is an unauthorised
unit trust associated with ECI whose units are held by pension funds so as to
enable them to participate in the provision of capital.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1 -5 million
and at 31 March 1980 loans and investments of the Corporation amounted to
£415 million.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of
which about 142 million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (£o-io paid) are held by
industrial, shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and nf million
‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (£0-50 paid) are held by the Bank of England and
certain central banks in the Commonwealth. At 31 March 1980 the CDFC
held investments of about £28 million spread over a wide range of industries
in 36 countries.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside the Commonwealth. At the end of 1979 the
CDC had a total capital commitment of £449 million (see p 89).
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for national governments,
public authorities and international bodies. At the end of 1979 the Crown
Agents did work for over 300 public organisations in nearly 100 countries. The
members of the Board are appointed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs.
Under the provisions of the Crown Agents Act 1979 the Crown Agents
operate as agents on behalf of government and public sector bodies in Britain
and overseas in such areas as procurement, recruitment and investment
management. They also carry on other activities such as consultancy work, in
their own right. The Crown Agents Holding and Realisation Board has the
duty of holding and realising on the best possible terms the remaining invest¬
ments in property and banking entered into by the unincorporated agents on
their own account.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Pension funds are administered by trustees in order to invest members’ pen¬
sion contributions, either directly on the market or through intermediaries
such as insurance companies. The total market value of funds managed,
covering private employers and much of the public sector, was of the order of
some £40,000 million at the end of 1979.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public
company registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its busi¬
ness is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other com¬
panies, it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its
profits to build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in
the latter half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing
capital towards overseas investment. At the end of 1979 members of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies held assets worth some £6,500
million of which 33 per cent was held overseas.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range
of Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed
partly by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a
half-yearly service charge which is usually taken out of the trust’s income.
Authorisation by the Department of Trade is needed before units can be
offered to the public; this is only granted if the trust deed meets the Depart¬
ment’s requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931. In June 1980 there were 1 -75
million unit holdings. The value of funds invested in authorised trusts depends
on the value of the underlying securities. This had risen from only £60 million
at the end of 1958 to £4,500 million by June 1980. There is a wide variety of
trusts both in the range of investment covered and in the ways of catering for
the differing needs of investors.
Building societies are non-profit-making mutual institutions which borrow
mainly short-term from individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw
their money on demand, although fixed-term investments at higher rates of
interest are becoming increasingly popular, and provide long-term loans at
variable rates of interest on the security of private dwellings purchased for
owner occupation. They also lend to a limited extent to house builders and on
the security of business or commercial property. Most societies pay and charge
interest on the basis of a structure of rates recommended periodically by The
Building Societies Association, the movement’s representative body.1 * * *
Building societies have existed in Britain for some 200 years and have been
subject to specific legislation governing their operations (now consolidated in
the Building Societies Act 1962) since 1836. The present legislation is adminis¬
tered by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, to whom the societies must
provide regular statements of their financial position and who has discretionary
powers to restrict or suspend a society’s operations if he considers that the
1 The income tax on interest is paid by the society on behalf of individual investors, at a rate equal
to their average tax rate (21 per cent for 1979-80). This means that while those not liable to tax
cannot reclaim the tax paid on their behalf, investors who pay at the basic rate receive a better
return than would otherwise be the case.

way in which its business is being conducted may put investors’ money at
risk.
Building societies account for about 90 per cent of all lending for house
purchase in Britain and in recent years they have overtaken the banks as
the principal repository for the personal sector’s total liquid assets. This
growth has been accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in
the hands of a few large societies. At the end of 1979 there were 289 registered
building societies with total assets of £45,600 million; over half this
amount was accounted for by the five largest societies and about 83 per cent
of it by the 17 largest. The amount lent on mortgages in 1979 was a record
£8,860 million.
A recent development in Great Britain has been the creation of credit unions,
of which there are 48. Credit unions are small savings and loan clubs where
members agree to pool part of their savings in order to provide themselves with
low cost credit. The Credit Unions Act 1979 requires that members of a credit
union should have a ‘common bond’, such as working in the same factory, and
provides a system for their registration and supervision by the Chief Registrar
of Friendly Societies.
In Northern Ireland they have grown successfully since the Industrial and
Provident Societies Act (Northern Ireland) was introduced in 1969.
The British insurance industry provides a comprehensive and competitive
service domestically and internationally. It has been estimated that British
insurers handle some 20 per cent of business placed on the world market. The
London market is the world’s leading centre for insurance where, in addition to
most British companies and Lloyd’s, a large number of overseas companies are
also represented. It is the world centre for the placement of international
reinsurance and, partly as a consequence of this, many British companies have
formed close relationships with overseas companies. A certain amount of
insurance is provided by friendly societies, banks and trade unions but most
insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or joint stock insurance
companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
Although some British insurance companies confine their activities to dom¬
estic business, the majority of the large companies undertaking general busi¬
ness, together with underwriters at Lloyd’s, regard themselves primarily as
international insurers, the largest proportion of their premium income and
claims being attributable to international risks. Without such a wide range of
interest, the British market would not be able to respond to the high level of
demand made on it in respect of very large single risks such as specially
designed ships for carrying liquefied gas and offshore oil production platforms.
There are about 820 companies authorised to carry on one or more classes of
insurance business in Britain, of which about 170 are overseas companies.
Some 300 companies belong to the British Insurance Association and these
account for about 95 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Life assurance is available from 281 authorised insurance companies and
from certain friendly societies: a very limited range of contracts is obtainable
from certain Lloyd’s underwriters. The main types of life policy are whole-life,
endowment, unit-linked term assurance and annuities. Many life assurance
policies are a form of savings contract as well as financial protection against
premature death.

Lloyd’s, established in the seventeenth century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its activities were originally confined to
the conduct of marine insurance business, a very considerable world-wide
market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets has been built up.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871
(further legislation, following the Fisher Report, see Bibliography, is being-
considered). The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The Society does not accept
insurance itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and
in competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through
Lloyd’s brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact
insurance with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Committee, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s policy.
There are over 18,000 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into about
400 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who accept
risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
Alongside its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a world-wide
organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in reinsurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between com¬
panies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representatives
of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 provides for the
registration of insurance brokers by a Registration Council.
Some 55 per cent of the general (that is, non-life) business of members of the
British Insurance Association is carried on overseas, partly by reinsurance on
the London market and partly through branches and agencies established in
over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business is that
resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use in
any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other
resources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance wdth the Treaty of Rome, insurance and reinsurance in
the European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the
governments of member states and intended to harmonise the legislation of the
various member countries, thus providing a ‘common market’, which would
avoid distortion of competition. Directives in operation cover freedom of
establishment to provide services in respect of reinsurance, compulsory motor
insurance, freedom of establishment in non-life insurance, and insurance
intermediaries. A directive on the co-ordination of regulations relating to
Community co-insurance operations came into force in 1980. The Commis¬
sion has submitted proposals for directives on insurance contract law and
insurance in areas of legal expenses, credit and suretyship.

The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
in 1973 to become ‘The Stock Exchange’ with its main trading floor and central
administration in London. There are also trading floors in Glasgow, Liver¬
pool, Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the Stock Exchange
are greater than in any other market in the world and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European exchanges com¬
bined. Some 8,000 securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange; at the end of
March 1980 these had a total market value of £280,330 million. About 6,000
securities of companies were quoted, including a number of leading overseas
securities. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the securities
at market valuation, the remainder being British, Irish Republic and other
overseas government and corporation stocks. Institutional investors, such as
pension funds, now own a higher proportion of ordinary shares than
individuals. A market in unlisted securities (generally those of small companies
which have been unable hitherto to obtain a Stock Exchange listing) is under
consideration.
A market in traded share options opened in 1978 on the Stock Exchange.
The market, initially in the shares of ten prominent British companies (now
increased to 15), enables investors not only to buy options to purchase shares in
future at pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves.
The market consists of banks and several firms of foreign exchange brokers
which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides those engaged in
international trade with foreign currencies for their transactions. The foreign
exchange banks are in close contact with financial centres abroad and are able
to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and future delivery. An
important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage transactions which
serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between different centres.
The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in the future are due to
receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to contract in advance to
sell or buy the foreign currency involved for sterling at a precise fixed exchange
rate. The Bank of England is responsible for granting recognition to broking
houses which wish to provide services to the foreign exchange and currency
deposit markets in ‘scheduled currencies’, that is, in those currencies for which
a specific brokerage scale is laid down by the Bank.
Anyone may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in
the hands of the five members of the London gold market. The five members
meet twice daily to establish a London fixing price for gold. This price
provides a reference point for world-wide dealings in gold. Although much
interest centres upon the fixings, active dealing takes place throughout the day.
Forward prices may also be quoted on request.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The need
for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance services
often determined the location of these physical markets in the City of London.
There are also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and barley),
rubber, soya bean meal, sugar, wool and non-ferrous metals (aluminium,
copper, lead, nickel, silver, tin and zinc).
Overseas Trade and
Payments
Although small in area and accounting for only about i -4 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area,
which accounts for more than one-third of all trade.
For hundreds of years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century,
when the rapid growth of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied
by Britain’s development as an international trading centre, overseas trade has
been of vital importance to the economy. Britain exports goods to the value of
about £40,700 million, about one-quarter of the gross domestic product. It is a
major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aerospace products, metal manufac¬
tures, electrical equipment, chemicals and textiles, and a growing oil exporter.
Britain relies upon imports for almost half of its total consumption of food¬
stuffs, and for most of the raw materials needed for its industries. It is among
the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs, timber and paper, metals and ores,
and other raw materials. Invisible trade is also of great significance to the
economy, and Britain’s net earnings are second only to those of the United
States.
A sound commercial banking system and a wide range of financial institu¬
tions ensure that commercial needs are met for both short- and long-term
finance for international trade. The facilities provided by merchant banks and
accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of
goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of Britain’s overseas trade (including its
distribution by commodity and area). It also summarises the main aspects of
Britain’s invisible transactions, commercial policy, controls on trade and pay¬
ments and government services to exporters. The chapter ends with a descrip¬
tion of Britain’s balance of payments and its external assets and liabilities.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
exports and imports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1979 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £40,700 million and its
imports of goods at about £44^00 million (both values are free on board,
defined in Table 30, and are on a balance of payments basis, as distinct from an
overseas trade statistics basis, which for imports includes the cost of insurance
and freight, and for both exports and imports includes returned goods).
Between 1978 and 1979 the value of exports rose by 16 per cent while that of
imports increased by 20 per cent. Over the same period the volume index of
exports increased by 3’6 per cent and of imports by ii’b per cent, the unit

OVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTS 369
Over three-quarters of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods, both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group of goods is
machinery and transport equipment, which in 1979 accounted for 34 per cent
of total exports. Exports of machinery alone accounted for 23 per cent of total
exports in 1979. The share of chemicals has grown fairly steadily, to reach n
per cent in 1979. The share of textiles has fallen from 19 per cent in 1948 to 7
per cent in i960 and 3 per cent in 1979.
Although Britain is still one of the largest importers of food in the world the
value of its imported food supplies has been growing less rapidly than the value
of total imports and the ratio of imported food, beverages and tobacco to total
imports, on an overseas trade statistics basis, has fallen from 39 per cent in 1954
to 13 per cent in 1979. There has been a similar downward trend in the
proportion accounted for by basic materials—from 31 per cent in 1954 to about
8 per cent in 1979.

J Export unit value index as a percentage of import unit value index.
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products amounted to about 11 per
cent of the total value of imports during 1979. A fall of 12 per cent in the
volume of crude oil imports, reflecting increasing production of North Sea oil,
was more than offset by rising oil prices, and value increased by 5 per cent.
In the past 25 years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in the other
main industrial countries, in the proportion of imports accounted for by
finished manufactures. Such imports rose from about 5 per cent of total
imports in 1954 to 36 per cent in 1979 when they were valued at £17,560
million. Imports of semi-manufactures have also been increasing and since
1962 have formed a larger part of the total import bill than basic materials,
partly the result of a shift of the early stages of the manufacturing processes to
the supplying countries. Imports of chemicals and other semi-manufactures
totalled £13,882 million in 1979 and accounted for 29 per cent of total imports.

Although Britain’s trade has, in general, grown fastest in recent years with the
rest of the European Community, its largest market, there was a marked
change in the pattern of British exports following the large rise in the price of
oil at the end of 1973. This generated substantial reserves of foreign exchange
for the oil-exporting countries, and British exports to them rose in value by 52
per cent between 1973 and 1974. On the other hand, the slowdown in activity
in most of the developed economies during 1974 and 1975 reduced the rate of
growth of British exports to these economies in 1975.
In 1976 and 1977 there was a return to growth in world trade and exports to
the developed industrial countries continued the recovery which began in the
latter part of 1975. Slower growth in world trade in 1978 was similarly reflected
in Britain’s export performance. World trade appears to have expanded rather
faster in 1979 but British export performance was adversely affected by a loss of
price competitiveness, political developments in Iran, a change of import
regulations in Nigeria, and industrial disputes at home. In 1979 the Federal
Republic of Germany replaced the United States as Britain’s largest single
export market. Details of Britain’s principal export markets and sources of
supply in 1978 and 1979 are given in Tables 32 and 33.

Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
As far back as estimates have been made (for nearly two centuries) Britain has
usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions. These fall into three
main groups: services (receipts and payments arising from services, as distinct
from goods, supplied to and received from overseas residents); interest, profits
and dividends (income arising from outward and inward investment); and
transfers between Britain and other countries. Table 34 shows the breakdown
of the figures from 1970 to 1979. Services of the private sector (and public
corporations) include sea transport and civil aviation, travel, financial services
(including insurance) and ‘other services’ which include commissions on
imports, royalties, services between related companies, construction work
overseas, agency expenses and many other services.
The balance on invisibles in 1979 was £1,541 million. Gross earnings of
£22,397 million from invisible exports were over half the total of £40,689
million from visible exports. The surplus in 1979 was lower than the surplus of
£2,166 million in 1978, mainly owing to increased earnings by foreign oil
companies in Britain associated particularly with increased oil production in
the North Sea, higher travel expenditure overseas and increased payments to
the European Community.
The deficits on government services have related notably to military services
overseas, which have remained fairly steady in recent years, though currency

changes have caused the sterling value to rise. Substantial government transfer
payments relate to economic grants to developing countries (see p 88) and
subscriptions to international organisations including, since 1973, Britain’s
contribution to the common budget for the financing of European Community
expenditure.
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (since 1973 as Part
the European Community, which operates as a single unit), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) (see p 91). As a member of the European Com¬
munity, Britain participates in the development of the Community’s commer¬
cial policy. The Community’s common customs tariff is, on average, at a
similar level to the tariffs of other major industrial countries.
Protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years as a result of
negotiations held under the auspices of the GATT, which also seek to reduce
tariffs and other barriers to trade and to eliminate discrimination in inter¬
national commerce.

In the latest series of the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations, the

have the common aim of reducing or eliminating existing non-tariff barriers to
trade and preventing the erection of new obstacles. They cover areas such as
technical barriers (calling for the use of international standards whenever

possible), government procurement (calling for liberalisation of government
purchasing), customs valuation (aiming at greater uniformity for customs
valuation methods), and an agreement on subsidies and countervailing duties.
Developed countries have undertaken not to grant export subsidies and all
signatories undertake not to apply countervailing duties unless it can be
demonstrated that a subsidy causes or threatens material injury to the domestic
market.
The GATT Anti-Dumping Code, to which the European Community is a
signatory, is implemented by a Community regulation which controls the
anti-dumping action that may be taken to protect British industry (as part of
Community industry) against unfair competition and determines the criteria
by which allegations of dumping are judged.
All tariffs on trade between Britain and the other European Community
countries have been eliminated. Britain applies the common customs tariff to
all countries neither belonging to, nor having any special arrangement with,
the Community, subject to special arrangements for some industrial materials.

and Spain and non-reciprocal agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yugoslavia, and a group of African, Carib¬
bean and Pacific countries (the ACP states, see below). Tariff preference is
also given to other developing countries under the Generalised System of
Preferences, the Faroe Islands, the overseas countries and territories of
member countries, and to Greece and Turkey under the association agree¬
ments between them and the Community.
Former Commonwealth preferential agreements have been phased out and
replaced, in the case of 29 developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the
Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), by the trade provisions of the Convention of
Lome which came into effect in 1975. This was succeeded by a second
convention, Lome II, in March 1980. A further 29 non-Commonwealth
developing countries within the same geographical area are also signatories.
Developing and industrial countries, including Britain, have agreed to
establish a common fund to help to maintain stabilised prices of raw materials
(see p 91). Work is in hand in UNCTAD to finalise the detailed arrangements
for this new institution. It is envisaged that the fund will have capital of up to
$750 million, to which Britain’s contribution will be approximately $20
million.
There are now very few restrictions maintained by Britain on overseas transac¬
tions. Exchange controls on capital movements (originally introduced as an
emergency measure at the beginning of the second world war) were abolished
during 1979. As a result, British residents are free to purchase and use foreign
currency for any purpose, including direct or portfolio investment abroad, and
remittances and gifts abroad, and to maintain foreign currency bank accounts.
Controls on the lending of sterling abroad have also been removed. Gold may
be freely bought and sold. These measures enable Britain to meet in full its
obligations on capital movements under European Community provisions and
also those under the OECD Code on Capital Movements. Controls on trade in
goods are described below.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or
export of goods. Most goods may be imported freely under the provisions of
the Open General Import Licence. Only a narrow range of goods is subject to
export control. Several other government departments have separate powers to
control imports and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT, and to the
IMF and the European Community, Britain has progressively removed quan¬
titative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market economies.
Those controls which do exist predominantly affect textile goods (usually
having been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the GATT Multi-
Fibre Arrangement, approved by the European Community in 1977). There
are comparatively few quantitative restrictions on imports from centrally
planned economies, and progress towards liberalisation continues to be made
wherever possible. In accordance with its obligations to the European Com¬
munity, Britain has also removed all quantitative restrictions on imports of
goods of Community origin, with the exception of certain internationally
recognised restrictions on a few goods such as arms, ammunition and radioac¬
tive materials. Some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied by other

departments for the prohibition of goods bearing false or misleading indica¬
tions of origin or improperly bearing a registered trade mark, for the protection
of health or public safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other
non-economic reasons (for example, on animals, drugs and explosives).
The great majority of British exports are not subject to any government control
or direction. The controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise
exports of military and strategic significance. They also apply to certain
metals, metal products (including certain British coins), waste and scrap; on
cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, asses and mules, for humanitarian purposes and on
cattle, swine and certain meat exported to another member State of the
European Community, for health certification purposes; on endangered
species of animals and plants, in accordance with international agreements; on
photographic material over 60 years old and valued at £200 or more per item
and all other articles over 50 years old, to restrict the export of items of national
importance; on salmon and trout, to inhibit out-of-season fishing; on danger¬
ous drugs; on British spirits (beverages) in casks of less than nine gallons; and
on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) products.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing information and advice about oppor¬
tunities for trade in other countries and credit insurance facilities. Export
promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Indus¬
try), the Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the
Department of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official
export promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence
assistance to British exporters in appointing agents and locating potential
customers, help to exporters at trade fairs and other promotional events
overseas, and support for firms participating in missions overseas and for
inward commercial visits to Britain. It includes representatives of commerce
and industry, the Trades Union Congress, the Department of Trade and the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and operates under the general authority
of the Secretary of State for Trade, who is the president.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the offices of the BOTB
throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of the
British Diplomatic Service overseas. Overseas officers work closely with the
BOTB in the provision of services for exporters. They regularly report on local
economic and commercial conditions and generally assist the exporter to
overcome any difficulties he encounters in trade with the country in question,
particularly those arising out of governmental regulations.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insur¬
ance for about a third of the country’s export trade and insures exports of both
goods and services. The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted
default of the buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter
receiving payment, new import restrictions, and war or civil disturbance in the
buyer’s country. Cover may commence from the date of contract or (at lower
premiums) from the date of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of
repayment given direct to banks financing exporters, whether in sterling or

foreign currencies. Alternatively, for contracts over £,1 million ECGD will
guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling them to pay on cash terms,
or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed buying programme of an
overseas country. The banks provide finance against these guarantees. ECGD
is also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the commercial
market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over £250,000.
Investment insurance is provided for new British investment overseas
against expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at many of the international specialist trade fairs throughout the world. Par¬
ticipation in trade fairs and store promotions overseas are forms of export
promotion for which the Government provides information and financial
assistance to exporters.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade partially offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of the
balance of payments and its main constituent items from 1970 to 1979 are given
in summary in Table 35 and in greater detail since 1977 in Tables 36 and 37.
The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of particular import¬
ance. The first is the balance on current account, covering both visible (exports
and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment income and
transfers) transactions. This, together with capital transfers, provides a
measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding to or using
up overseas assets. The second indicator is the balance for official financing.
This is the net result of all external transactions, that is the current account,
capital transfers, investment and other capital transactions (including official
long-term capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and changes in
non-residents’ balances held in London in sterling and in overseas currencies)
and other flows, including unidentified transactions reflected in the balancing
item. The balance for official financing shows the impact of all external
transactions on the reserves and official debt position, that is, how much is
available to add to the reserves and repay any official borrowing in the case of a
net surplus, or how much must be financed by drawing on the reserves or by
borrowing if there is a net deficit. Table 36 gives details of the current account
since 1977. Increased production of North Sea oil was largely responsible for
the fall in the visible deficit from £3,927 million in 1976 to £1,546 million in
1978 when there was a current account surplus of £620 million. The balance on
current account deteriorated in 1979, however, a deficit of £1,863 million
reflecting a worsening of the non-oil balance and a fall in the invisibles surplus.
The balance for official financing showed a surplus of £1,710 million in 1979
compared with a deficit of £1,126 million in 1978 and a surplus of £7,362
million in 1977. Although the abolition of exchange controls towards the end of
1979 resulted in substantial capital outflows (an estimated total effect of £2,000
million outflow in the second half of the year), this was more than offset by
identified inflows of £3,600 million, resulting from a marked improvement in
the attractiveness of sterling. The inflow went principally into private holdings
of British Government stocks and sterling deposits with British banks. Over¬
seas investment in the private sector amounted to £2,883 million while British
private investment overseas totalled £6,401 million.

The direct benefit of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf oil and gas
programme to the balance of payments has increased substantially. Sales of oil
and gas (valued at contract prices) exceeded £6,200 million in 1979. Identified
net balance of payments items resulted in a net outflow of about £1,250 million
in 1979 compared with about £570 million in 1976.
Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its IMF
quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide convertible
currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant in
exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of their

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong
balance of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in
certain direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments
of various kinds to the IMF. The role of SDRs as a central standard of value in
international transactions (see p 209) is being enhanced.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included that
are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valuation.
By the end of 1979 Britain’s external assets exceeded liabilities by about £6,400
million, compared with about £3,000 million at the end of 1978 and a net
debtor position for the previous three years.

OVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTS 379
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been £35,767 million at the end of 1979. Direct investment1 excluding banking
and insurance, other than in the United States, and oil accounted for £19,147
million of the total, portfolio investment for £9,500 million and oil for £6,350
million.
British banking and commercial claims at the end of 1979 totalled £11,121
million. Within this total banking claims were £5,656 million; suppliers’ export
credit to unrelated firms was £4,611 million. Official external assets, including
re-financed export credit, amounted to £4,877 million, which included out¬
standing inter-government loans by Britain of £1,281 million. These assets,
with official reserves of £ 13,220 million (valuing gold at the market price rather
than at the value included in the published levels), resulted in aggregate
identified external assets at the end of 1979 of some £64,985 million.
The dismantling of the exchange control regulations in 1979 meant that foreign
currency became available without limit for direct and portfolio investment
overseas. The weight of evidence is that overseas investment strengthens the
current account of the balance of payments by helping to keep and expand
markets for British exports (many investments are in distribution and similar
export-promoting sectors, or create demand abroad for other British goods and
services) to the benefit of output and jobs at home. The balance of payments
will also be strengthened by invisible earnings flowing from additional overseas
investment; this will be particularly important in the future when the overseas
earnings from North Sea oil begin to decline.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £2,738 million in 1979 com¬
pared with £2,394 million in 1978. (The latest available area analysis indicates
that in 1978, £484 million was placed in developing countries, £543 million in
other member countries of the European Community and £799 million in
North America.) With the inclusion of oil, portfolio and other investment,
aggregate private investment outflows totalled £6,401 million in 1979 com¬
pared with £4,414 million in 1978.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1979 are estimated to have been some
£58,559 million. Net drawing on the IMF accounted for £480 million of this
sum and foreign currency borrowing by the Government for a further £1,955
million. Foreign currency borrowing by public bodies under the exchange
cover scheme2 totalled £4,202 million. Inter-governmental loans to Britain,
mainly a consequence of the second world war and its aftermath, totalled
£1,547 million of which £1,262 million was owed to the United States and £284
million to Canada. Other public sector liabilities of £7,093 million comprised
mainly overseas holdings of British government securities. Treasury bills and
notes and other borrowing by British public corporations and local authorities
from overseas. British banking and commercial liabilities, including liabilities
in sterling and in foreign currencies, totalled £16,802 million. Liabilities in the
form of direct overseas investment in Britain’s private sector excluding bank¬
ing and insurance totalled £26,480 million.
1 Direct investment refers mainly to the establishment of subsidiary companies and banks, while
portfolio investment refers to investment in company securities.
2 A scheme first introduced in 1969 whereby local authorities and public corporations raise foreign
currency from overseas residents either directly or through British banks and surrender it to the
Exchange Equalisation Account in exchange for sterling for use to finance expenditure in Britain.
The Treasury sells the borrower foreign currency to service and repay the loan at the exchange rate
that applied when the loan was taken out.

Inward Private
Investment
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Since the 1960s London has been the centre of the euro-currency business,
whereby banks and other institutions accept deposits and extend credit in
foreign currencies. At the end of 1979 liabilities of British banks in foreign
currencies amounted to £126,726 million (of which the equivalent of £98,871
million was in United States dollars) and claims were £121,351 million.
The ‘sterling balances’, or foreign holdings in Britain of sterling in the form
of British government securities, bank deposits, deposits with local authorities
and finance houses, and Treasury bills totalled £11,145 million. Of this,
£2,793 million was held by residents of oil-exporting countries, £1,935 million
by residents of other member countries of the European Community and
£6,417 million by other holders. About 30 per cent of the balances were official
holdings (mostly those of central monetary institutions) and 70 per cent were
private holdings used by overseas residents to finance their international
transactions. The total of these liabilities (excluding the counterpart of bor¬
rowing) remained broadly constant between the end of 1945 an<^ I97°» then
rose sharply in the early 1970s. As trade and payments arrangements have
become more diversified in recent years the relative importance of sterling as a
reserve currency has declined.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £7,385 million in 1970 to £26,480 million at the end of
1979. Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale
of their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued.
Earnings and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1979 the
inflow of direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil,
amounted to £2,883 million.
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1979
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies
incorporated abroad (excluding oil, banking and insurance)—£11,907 million
(this figure has been extrapolated from the book value at the end of 1974,
taking account of subsequent annual transactions); portfolio holdings of
British securities—£4,530 million; the book value of the net assets in Britain of
overseas oil companies—£6,950 million; and borrowing by British companies
overseas—£3,093 million.
Of the 1,241 million inflow of direct investment excluding oil into Britain in
1978 (the latest year for which detailed figures are available), £787 million
originated in North America and £275 million in other member countries of the
European Community. Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits
to British industry, including technological development, which in turn will
strengthen the economy and the balance of payments.
Promotion of the Sciences
Britain has for centuries provided an atmosphere of learning congenial to its
scientists, whose record of achievements in relation to size of population is in
many respects unsurpassed. This record has been maintained throughout the
twentieth century and British scientists remain in the forefront in many areas.
One recent example was the research carried out by two British scientists
which made possible the birth of the world’s first ‘test-tube’ baby in Britain in
July 1978. Nobel prizes for science have been won by 62 British citizens, a
number exceeded only by the United States.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists
and ensures that adequate research is devoted to matters of national interest,
which include defence (see Chapter 4), industrial innovation, health, environ¬
mental protection, use and conservation of natural resources, the provision
of good food, shelter and energy and of efficient transport and communica¬
tions.
Expenditure Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in 1978
was £3,250 million, or 2 per cent of the gross domestic product. About half was
financed by the Government which carries out about a quarter of Britain’s
research and development in its establishments. Remaining government
expenditure on research went mainly to industry and the universities. Funds
for research are also provided by private and public enterprises and by private
endowments and trusts.
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Central responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, while responsibility for technology rests mainly with
the Secretary of State for Industry. In some cases the Prime Minister has a
co-ordinating role. Other government departments are responsible for
research and development related to their executive responsibilities. In 1972
the Government extended the customer-contractor approach to all its applied
research and development, whereby each department as customer, with advice
from its Chief Scientist, defines requirements and the work is undertaken by
contractors (government laboratories, research councils, research associa¬
tions, industry and the universities). Most departments have a Chief Scien¬
tist’s Organisation, which formulates requirements, selects the most suitable
contractors and co-operates with them to obtain the best value for money.
An Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development provides a
central forum of external advice to ministers on the deployment of applied
research and development in both the public and private sectors, on the future
development and application of technology, and on the role of Britain in
international collaboration in such activities. It has published a number of
reports on aspects of new technology.
A Committee of Chief Scientists and Permanent Secretaries is responsible
for ensuring that scientific questions are brought before ministers as
appropriate and that scientific priorities reflect those of the Government as
a whole.

The Department of Education and Science discharges its responsibilities for
basic and applied civil science mainly through the five research councils to
which it allocates funds from its science budget (the budget totals £383 million
in 1980-81). The budget is intended to further scientific knowledge, to
maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education.
The councils and their allocations are: the Agricultural Research Council (£35
million), the Medical Research Council (£71-8 million), the Natural Environ¬
ment Research Council (£45 million), the Science Research Council (£201-1
million) and the Social Science Research Council (£i9,7 million). Science
budget grants are also made to the British Museum (Natural History) and to
the Royal Society. About one-fifth of the budget usually goes on research
grants and contracts to universities, polytechnics and elsewhere, over two-
fifths to research units and other establishments of the research councils, about
one-seventh to postgraduate support and one-sixth to subscriptions to inter¬
national scientific organisations. The Department is also responsible for some
aspects of international scientific relations and helps to co-ordinate govern¬
ment policy regarding scientific and technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research
council system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance
between national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation of
the science budget between research councils and other bodies; and promotes
close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its membership
includes the chairman or secretary of each of the research councils, the chair¬
man of the University Grants Committee, the Chief Scientists from depart¬
ments with a major interest in the work of the research councils, the Chief
Scientist to the Central Policy Review Staff, and independent members drawn
from universities, industry and the Royal Society.
Each of the five research councils is an autonomous body established under
Royal Charter with membership drawn from the universities, professions,
industry and the Government. They conduct research through their own
research establishments and by supporting selected research in universities
and other higher education bodies. As well as being financed from the science
budget, three of the councils receive commissions, estimated at £73 million in
1980-81, from departments under the customer-contractor principle. The
Agricultural Research Council receives 47 per cent of its income from commis¬
sions, the Natural Environment Research Council 32 per cent and the Medical
Research Council 17 per cent.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) has eight institutes under its direct
control: the Animal Breeding Research Organisation, at Edinburgh; the Insti¬
tute for Research on Animal Diseases, at Newbury (Berkshire); the Institute
of Animal Physiology, at Cambridge; the Food Research Institute, at Nor¬
wich; the Letcombe Laboratory, at Wantage (Oxfordshire), dealing with the
growth of crops in relation to soil conditions and cultivation; the Meat
Research Institute, at Bristol; the Poultry Research Centre, at Edinburgh; and
the Weed Research Organisation, at Yarnton, near Oxford. There are six ARC
units under distinguished scientists associated with universities. The ARC is
also responsible for 15 independent state-aided agricultural research institutes,
notably the Rothamsted Experimental Station, at Harpenden (Hertfordshire),
which is the largest agricultural research institute in Britain and deals with

research on soils, fertilisers, crop physiology and crop husbandry; and the
National Institute of Agricultural Engineering, at Silsoe (Bedfordshire).
There are also eight independent institutes in Scotland financed by the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from the
ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC is planning to devote additional sums to research in a number of
areas including the study of photosynthesis with the aim of increasing crop
yields, the breeding of plants which could make their own nitrogen and so
bring savings in the use of fertilisers, and work on studying animal behaviour
and diseases to obtain healthier and more productive livestock.
The main research establishments of the Medical Research Council (MRC) are
the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, which
carries out fundamental research relevant to medicine, the Clinical Research
Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, London, and the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology at Cambridge. In addition, the Council has over 60 research units,
mostly located in university departments, medical schools and hospitals in
Britain. These include a Radiobiology Unit, a Toxicology Unit, a
Pneumoconiosis Unit and a Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit.
The Council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology and
Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physiological
Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research Board. In
addition, the MRC is advised by committees concerned with particular aspects
of its work and with research grants. The MRC’s arrangements for the support
of research fall under four main headings: investigations by members of its
scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments; short-term (‘pro-
ject) grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; long-term grants in
support of specific research programmes in university departments (‘pro¬
gramme grants ), and research training awards (fellowships and studentships)
tenable both at home and overseas.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is responsible for
encouraging, planning and executing research in the physical and biological
sciences relating to man’s natural environment and its resources. These
researches are broadly grouped and defined as: the Solid Earth—its physical
properties and mineral resources; Seas and Oceans—their behaviour and
living and mineral resources; Inland Waters—their behaviour and living
resources; Terrestrial Environments—wildlife communities and their
resources; Atmosphere—its structure and interactions; and a number of
interdisciplinary studies including pollution and the physical and biological
properties of the Antarctic environment. Research programmes which the
NERC is planning to expand include those on geological work in connection
with deep drilling and mapping, which is important for future mineral and
energy exploration; new means of insect pest control using viruses harmless to
man; the climate; remote sensing by satellite, for resource and ecological
surveys; and modelling the behaviour of British estuaries.
The Council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of
Marine Biochemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the
Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the
Institute of Virology and the Sea Mammal Research Unit. The Council also
maintains central scientific and technical services which include research
vessel services, an experimental cartography unit, and computing services.

Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate Biol¬
ogy, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology and some university units.
The Science Research Council (SRC) supports basic research in astronomy,
geophysics, the biological sciences, chemistry, mathematics, physics,
engineering and applied sciences, in furthering its primary purpose of sustain¬
ing standards of education and research in the universities and polytechnics.
Most of the SRC’s resources are devoted to helping university and polytechnic
staff to carry out basic research at the forefront of their subjects, in their
institution, in one of the Council’s research establishments, or elsewhere; to
encouraging active collaboration in research between the higher education
institutions and industry; to identifying and supporting areas of special
importance and to enabling suitable graduates to receive further training in
methods of research or a specialised branch of science or engineering of
importance to British industry. The SRC provides grants for research pro¬
jects, and awards studentships for training in methods of research or advanced
courses of study and fellowships to promising scientists or engineers to enable
them to carry out their own independent research programmes.
The SRC maintains four research establishments: the Daresbury Laboratory
at Warrington (Cheshire), the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmon-
ceux (East Sussex), the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, and the Rutherford
and Appleton Laboratories, with headquarters at Chilton in Oxfordshire
(which are being merged). The establishments are each centres of specialised
research, but are also used for the development and operation of research
equipment beyond the resources of an academic institution. They provide
support for scientists whose research needs access to facilities run by inter¬
national research organisations, such as the powerful particle accelerators at
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the high-flux
neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL).
The SRC provides national contributions to CERN, the civil science pro¬
gramme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Anglo Australian
Telescope, the European Incoherent Scatter Project and part of the European
Space Agency contribution. It also contributes to, and shares with its French
and German partners, the control of the ILL reactor at Grenoble.
Developments in engineering research and training geared to the needs of
industry are major concerns of the SRC. Special programmes are being
supported in three areas—polymer engineering, marine technology and pro¬
duction engineering—within a general effort to develop research and post¬
graduate training in university engineering departments. Other subjects
receiving major support include microelectronics and computer applications
(such as industrial robotics), materials and energy conservation, information
and communication systems, biotechnology, medical engineering and coal
technology. A network to provide an interactive computing facility to univer¬
sities has been built up and is serviced at Chilton.
Astronomy uses both ground-based techniques, such as optical and radio
telescopes, and space-based methods (see p 396). Optical astronomy is carried
out in university departments and, within the SRC, at the Royal Greenwich

Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Instruments include the
Royal Greenwich Observatory’s Isaac Newton Telescope, of diameter 2-5
metres (8 feet), which is being installed at a new site on the island of La Palma
in the Canary Islands; the Anglo Australian Telescope, of diameter 3-9 metres
(13 feet), at Siding Spring, Australia, in a joint project with the Australian
Government; a i-2-metre (4-ft) Schmidt telescope on the same site; and
optical telescopes operated by the South African Astronomical Observatory, to
which the SRC contributes. A 3-8-metre (12-ft) infra-red telescope, the largest
telescope in the world designed specifically to make infra-red observations, was
inaugurated at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, in 1979.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research in
radio astronomy with substantial support from the SRC.
The SRC establishments concerned with the provision of facilities for univer¬
sity research in nuclear physics are at Chilton, which supports university teams
engaged in experiments in particle physics at CERN and other centres, and the
Daresbury Laboratory, where a 30 million volt tandem accelerator for research
into nuclear structure is due for completion in 1981.
Support is provided for high-quality research in biological and natural sci¬
ences, mathematics and science-based archaeology. Where experimental

polytechnics, central facilities have been provided. For example, at the Dares¬
bury Laboratory a new synchrotron storage ring came into operation in 1980.
It provides high intensity electromagnetic radiation used in a wide range of
experiments in materials science, surface physics, crystallography and molecu¬
lar biology. Other central facilities include a spallation neutron source being
built at Chilton to provide a pulsed beam of neutrons, and a high-powered laser
facility, also at Chilton, which is used to study plasmas.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) encourages, supports and car¬
ries out research in, and disseminates knowledge about, the social sciences.
The SSRC’s areas of interest include economics; political science; psychology;
social anthropology; social and economic history; sociology and social
administration; social sciences and the law; education; management and
industrial relations; human geography; linguistics; planning; and various
aspects of a wide range of other disciplines. It initiates research into such topics
as health policy, energy policy, population studies, central and local govern¬
ment, young people in society, transmitted deprivation, and the social impact
of North Sea oil. Grants are provided for research projects at universities and
other institutions, and awards made to postgraduate students. The SSRC also
has four research units: the Industrial Relations Research Unit at Warwick
University; the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social
Structure; the Research Unit on Ethnic Relations at Aston University (Bir¬
mingham); and the Centre for Socio-legal Studies at Oxford University.
Of the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the
academic year 1978-79 (over £274 million), the largest government contribu¬
tion (over £160 million) was through the University Grants Committee.
Scientific research in the universities and other institutions of higher educa¬
tion is also supported through the research councils. This support takes two
forms. First, nearly two-thirds of the postgraduate students in science and
technology receive maintenance awards from the research councils, through

postgraduate studentships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up to
three years of training in research work and in others for shorter periods for
advanced studies. Second, grants and contracts are given to the universities
and other institutions by the research councils for specified projects, particu¬
larly in new or developing areas of research. The ARC, MRC and SSRC
maintain a number of research units within universities. In addition, the
research councils provide central facilities in their own establishments for use
by university research workers. The other main channels of support for
scientific research in the universities are various government departments, the
Royal Society, industry and the independent foundations.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding reputa¬
tions in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale close
relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects. Britain has two ‘science parks’,
established by Trinity College, Cambridge, and Heriot-Watt University,
Edinburgh. These are sites containing science-based industries and are
designed to facilitate commercial developments in advanced technology in
consultation with and to the benefit of local scientists.
In 1980-81 total Government research and development expenditure is esti¬
mated to be some £2,700 million. The largest departmental research and
development budget is that of the Ministry of Defence (see p 100). The main
civil departments involved are the Department of Education and Science,
whose estimated research expenditure of £607 million in 1980-81 is mostly
related to expenditure by the research councils and the universities; the
Department of Energy (£229 million in 1980-81); the Department of Industry
(£159 million); the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (a total of £85 million);
and the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport (a
total of £71 million).
The Department of Energy is responsible for the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority (UKAEA); research in support of the exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas; research into alternative sources of energy and conservation of
energy; co-ordination of energy research within government departments;
general approval of the research programmes of the coal, gas and electricity
supply industries; and co-ordination of British contributions to energy
research and development programmes sponsored by international bodies.
An Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel and Power
advises the Secretary of State on the general programme of research and
development of the nationalised energy industries and on other matters related
to energy research and development. An Energy Technology Support Unit at
Harwell (Oxfordshire) assists the Department in assessing technological pos¬
sibilities in energy policy, advises on long-term research and development
programmes, and assists in their management.
An Offshore Energy Technology Board advises the Secretary of State for
Energy on research and development in offshore oil and gas technology and is
responsible for programmes designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of
offshore operations and improve the competitive efficiency of the offshore
equipment industry in Britain.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of

importance are attached to its various applications. The UKAEA is the main
body carrying out relevant research and development. Its programme includes
work in support of the Government’s nuclear power programme, and it builds
and operates experimental and prototype reactors (see p 277). The Authority
also works outside the nuclear field. Research and development work is under¬
taken at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and at the
Culham Laboratory, also in Oxfordshire; at the Atomic Energy Establishment
at Winfrith (Dorset) and at establishments of the Authority’s northern division
at Risley (Cheshire), Dounreay (Highland), Springfields (Lancashire) and
Windscale (Cumbria). The Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth
(Cheshire) is the focal point of the UKAEA’s work in relation to the safety of
nuclear reactors and related plants and processes.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries
takes place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements and member¬
ship of bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (operating
under the aegis of the United Nations) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and through
research links between the UKAEA and counterpart organisations in other
countries.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, see p 73) including that concerned
with thermonuclear fusion (the release of controlled nuclear energy from the
joining of nuclei of light elements to form heavier ones). Britain’s centre for
fusion research is the UKAEA’s Culham Laboratory whose work forms part of
a co-ordinated European programme under the auspices of Euratom. A major
component of this programme is the Joint European Torus (JET) project
which is being built at Culham; the construction phase is due to be completed
by 1983. The JET experiment is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of
controlled nuclear fusion at the experimental level by producing plasma in the
conditions needed in a fusion reactor.
The Departments’ research programmes are the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Research which provides a common service to both
Departments. They are formulated by seven research requirement com¬
mittees, which bring together the main customer-contractor and research
policy interests.
About 40 per cent of the Departments’ programmes are carried out at their
research establishments: the Building Research Establishment (see p 256), the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory (see p 305) and the Hydraulics
Research Station, the remainder being undertaken by outside organisations.
About 50 per cent of the Department of the Environment’s programme is
devoted to environmental protection (including radioactive waste manage¬
ment, water resources and pollution), nearly 30 per cent to housing and
construction, and the remainder to planning, the appraisal of mineral
resources and the countryside. Some 45 per cent of the Department of Trans¬
port’s programme is concerned with highways, 20 per cent with railways and
inter-urban transport, 6 per cent with road safety and the remainder with local
and urban transport, freight and ports. Research associations receiving
financial assistance from the Departments include the Construction Industry
Research and Information Association, the Building Services Research and
Information Association, the Timber Research and Development Association
and the Water Research Centre.

The Department of Industry is responsible for the sponsorship of manufactur¬
ing industries and for technical services to industry, and for six research
establishments: the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington
(Greater London); the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL) at East Kil¬
bride (Strathclyde); the Warren Spring Laboratory (WSL) at Stevenage
(Hertfordshire); the National Maritime Institute (NMI) at Feltham (Greater
London); the Computer Aided Design Centre at Cambridge; and the Labora¬
tory of the Government Chemist in London. The NPL has responsibilities for
the national system of measurement, for technical aspects of standards (includ¬
ing the British Calibration Service) and for research in computing, numerical
analysis, chemical standards and materials applications. The NEL carries out
research in mechanical engineering aimed at helping industry improve designs
and production processes by the application of improved technology. Research
at the WSL is particularly concerned with control engineering, materials
handling, metals extraction, mineral processing, waste materials processing
and environmental technology. The NMI has special facilities and expertise
relating to the characteristics and performance of ships and offshore struc¬
tures, marine traffic and navigation safety, wind and water forces on structures
and in conducting marine trials and measurements at sea. The NMI is to be
converted into a non-governmental research body. The Computer Aided
Design Centre is concerned with increasing and optimising the use of com¬
puter aided design by industry. Analytical services and scientific advice to
government departments are provided by the Laboratory of the Government
Chemist. These establishments undertake contract research for British indus¬
try and overseas firms.
The Department sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with industry,
universities and research associations. In accordance with the Government’s
customer-contractor principle, the Department administers a number of
requirements boards to determine the objectives and balance of the relevant
research and development programmes, to further the practical application of
technology and to advise on science and technology matters in their fields.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals
and minerals; metrology and standards; garment and allied industries; and
electrical technology. They are responsible to the Secretary of State for Indus¬
try and include representatives from other departments, industry and bodies in
the public sector. The Chief Scientist’s Requirements Board covers other
branches of technology.
Agricultural research is carried out mainly by the Agricultural Research Coun¬
cil, the government agricultural departments and by private industry.
Fisheries research is conducted by the government fisheries departments, the
White Fish Authority, and the Natural Environment Research Council.
Advice is given to the government agricultural departments and to the ARC on
state-aided research and development in agriculture and food in Great Britain
by a joint consultative organisation.
The Agricultural Development and Advisory Service of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic research. At its
Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and laboratory investi¬
gations are carried out into most diseases affecting farm livestock, and the
making and supplying of certain biological products. The Harpenden Labora¬
tory is concerned with research and development on plant health problems,

and also on the detection of pesticide residues in treated crops and crop
products, and on the formulation of pesticides. Research work on insects,
mites and fungi affecting food storage and on harmful mammals and birds is
carried out at laboratories at Slough (Berkshire) and Tolworth and Worples-
don (both in Surrey). They are also concerned with the safe use of pesticides in
food storage and in animal husbandry, and with the effect on wildlife of
pesticides of all kinds.
The Chief Scientific Adviser (Food) and the Food Science Division provide
advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular attention is paid to
the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including consideration of food
additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained with the Department
of Health and Social Security and with other government departments and
agencies. The Division has laboratories in Norwich and London.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries, is mainly concerned with the problems of cultivar
taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed potato production, plant pathology,
pesticides, and the ecology of birds, mammals and insects harmful to agricul¬
ture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture
is responsible for promotion of research in agriculture and in veterinary and
food sciences with the aim of improving efficiency of production, marketability
of foods and the health of plants and animals. The Department is also respon¬
sible for work on forest science, ecology of freshwater and marine fish as well as
on the biology of freshwater resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s research work is carried out
by the Directorate of Fisheries Research at Lowestoft and by the Torry
Research Station in Aberdeen. The former includes a Marine Fisheries
Laboratory and Fisheries Radiobiological Laboratory at Lowestoft, a Shellfish
and Marine Pollution Laboratory at Burnham-on-Crouch (Essex), a Salmon
and Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory in London, a Shellfish Cultivation
Station at Conwy (Gwynedd) and a Fish Disease Centre at Weymouth. Torry
Research Station and an outstation at Hull are concerned with the investigation
of all aspects of fish technology. There are seven research vessels engaged on
sea-going, inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland maintains a Marine Research Laboratory and five
sea-going research ships at Aberdeen, and a Freshwater Fisheries Research
Laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board, representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry, advises on research programmes, objec¬
tives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and Development,
responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the laboratories’ programmes.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission at the Forest
Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Surrey, and the Northern Research
Station, Roslin, near Edinburgh. By means of grants, aid is also given for
forestry research work undertaken by various universities and other institu¬
tions, including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford. Expenditure
by the Commission on research work in Great Britain amounted to £4 million
in 1978-79. Research into the quality and uses of home-grown timber is
carried out by Princes Risborough Laboratory in Buckinghamshire, and also
by grant-aided associations. Research on Dutch elm disease is being carried out
by the Commission.

The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (founded in 1759), covering 120 hectares
(300 acres), and its 200-hectare (500-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly
(West Sussex) are part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The
Herbarium houses one of the largest collections of specimens in the world and
is primarily concerned with research into the classification of plants and the
preparation of plant lists as well as the classification of about 50,000 specimens
a year from overseas. A Conservation Unit gathers and provides information
on endangered species of plant on a worldwide basis. The study of plant
anatomy, plant biochemistry, cytology and genetics is undertaken in the
Jodrell Laboratory. The laboratory’s plant physiology section is based at
Wakehurst Place where research is being carried out into seed germination and
storage. A wide range of living plants, comprising some 3,100 types represent¬
ing 340 families of plant, is displayed at Kew.
The Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh was founded in 1670 and is
administered by the Department of Agriculture and F'isheries for Scotland.
Associated gardens are the Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell near Stranraer,
the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore near Dunoon, and Dawyck Garden
at Stobo near Peebles. The large collection of living plants, both out of doors
and in greenhouses, is used for taxonomic research (into plant classification).
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence engages in research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities (see p 100). It also undertakes
certain research for civil purposes, including meteorology (being responsible
for financing the Meteorological Office at Bracknell in Berkshire, which com¬
piles weather forecasts and undertakes research in meteorology and some
aspects of geophysics), civil aviation and space research.
The Department of Health and Social Security spent £26 million on
research and development in 1979-80 of which £11 -4 million was on biomedi¬
cal research through the Medical Research Council. The Department’s Chief
Scientist is supported by a group of independent advisers covering a wide
range of scientific disciplines. The Department is involved in international
research and development, and is participating in the European Community’s
medical and public health research programme.
The Health and Safety Executive carries out research in its Health and
Safety Laboratories and by using appropriate outside contractors. Its area of
research covers all matters affecting the health and safety of people at work,
and the risks arising from work activities to the public. Fields of study include
explosion risks, fires, protective equipment, methods for monitoring and
measuring airborne contaminants, occupational medicine and hygiene, and
the safety of engineering systems.
The Department of Employment has an Economic and Social Division to
conduct and advise on its programme of research on socio-economic problems
including industrial relations and general manpower issues. Assistance is given
in social research by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and close
contact is maintained with the Social Science Research Council.
Nearly all of the Home Office’s expenditure on research and development,
of about £9 million a year, is concerned with law and order.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations, in particular those concerned with energy
(see Chapter 14), steel and transport. These organisations also give support to
other organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an indepen¬
dent public corporation which was set up in 1949 to promote the develop¬
ment and the exploitation of new technology. Its two main activities are to
exploit inventions developed in the universities and research council and
government establishments, and to provide finance for innovation by indus¬
trial companies. The NRDC has a portfolio of 6,000 British and overseas
patents and about 500 licensees, and also some 600 investments in develop¬
ment projects of which about 300 are joint ventures with industrial com¬
panies. It is expected to operate as a commercial organisation and has been
profitable for many years. Some of the major technical achievements which it
has exploited or supported include cephalosporin antibiotics, pyrethroid
insecticides, glass-reinforced cement, carbon fibres, printed circuit boards,
computers and computer software, computer-aided design, electric motors
and hovercraft.
A considerable amount of research is undertaken and financed by private
sector firms and learned bodies (see below). Virtually all industrial research
work is carried out within industry by firms in their own laboratories and by
research associations. Important contributions to the support of medical
research in particular subjects are made by industry, especially the phar¬
maceutical industry, and by the many private charities or voluntary organisa¬
tions which raise money for particular branches of research. Charities and
voluntary bodies between them contribute approximately £25 million a year to
medical research.
Within the total expenditure of £2,324 million on research and development
carried out within private industry in 1978, expenditure by private industry
accounted for £2,061 million, public corporations for £213 million and
research associations for £51 million. The main industries involved included
electronics (which spent £650 million), chemicals and allied products (£432
million), aerospace (£425 million), mechanical engineering (£182 million) and
motor vehicles (£130 million). Firms in science-based industries commit large
private funds to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
A scheme by which the Government helped firms with similar interests to form
organisations known as research associations, to carry out industrial research
co-operatively, was started in 1917. Encouragement by government grants,
related to the contributions made by the industries concerned, has lately been
phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support, such as that offered by
the Department of Industry’s Research and Development Requirements
Boards (see p 388). About 30 of these research associations operate in areas of
interest to the Department of Industry. In addition there are four (buildings
services; construction industry; timber; and water) linked with the Depart¬
ment of the Environment and four (Flour Milling and Baking; Campden Food
Preservation; British Food Manufacturing Industries; and British Industrial
Biological Research) linked with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food. Among the largest of the industrial research associations are those
dealing with production engineering, welding, electrical manufacturing, cot¬
ton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals and motor manufacturing. (See
also Chapter 13.)

THE LEARNED
SOCIETIES
Royal Society
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies, of which there are more than 300, have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of knowledge. The most eminent of those
concerned with science in its broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies
with specialised interests and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of
Arts, Royal Institution and British Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in Britain’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continu¬
ous existence. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal
Fellows, Foreign Members, of whom there are about 85, and the main body of
Fellows numbering about 900. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is
restricted to 40 persons a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21
members. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments
to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory councils
and committees concerned with research.
The Royal Society recognises the highest standards of scientific and tech¬
nological achievements through its elections to the Fellowship and the award of
its medals and endowed lectureships. It awards 14 medals (not all annually)
including the Copley Medal (its highest award) and three Royal Medals, while
there are seven endowed lectureships. The Society encourages research
through the award of grants and research appointments. It administers 18
research professorships, of which four are supported from private funds and
the remainder from its parliamentary grant. A further 12 senior research
fellowships and 30 other research fellowships are supported in British univer¬
sities. Grants for research are made from its private funds and from its
parliamentary grant, and particular funds are available for scientific investi¬
gations and expeditions, for travel by individual scientists, for studies in the
history of science and for scientific publications. The dissemination of scien¬
tific knowledge is encouraged by a programme of scientific discussion meetings
and through its publications. It has an extensive library of works relating to the
history of science. The council tenders advice to the Government and other
bodies on matters relating to science and technology and their application, and
study groups on particular aspects of science are established at intervals to
prepare reports which are widely distributed to the scientific community. A
number of committees of the council, some of them jointly with other bodies,
promote improvements in education in science subjects and emphasise the
importance of the applied sciences and engineering in industry. A joint
committee with the British Academy has been established to keep under review
the activities of learned societies in Britain and to assist them.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. As the
national academy of science, it represents Britain in all but one of the 18
international unions comprising the International Council of Scientific
Unions. The Society also represents Britain on the Council of the Inter¬
national Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. It is a member of the Euro¬
pean Science Foundation and certain other organisations, and also plays a
leading part in international scientific programmes. It has agreements for
exchange visits by scientists and co-operative research with many academies
throughout the world, and maintains informal relations to promote scientific
co-operation with many other countries. The largest formal scheme is the
European Science Exchange Programme, which provides for fellowships

(usually of one year) and study visits (lasting about two months) with 16 other
countries in Western Europe.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) is concerned with arts, architecture and
design, science and technology, industry and commerce, the environment and
education. Since its foundation in 1754, one of the Society’s principal objects
has been to promote the progress of all branches of practical knowledge, chiefly
by means of lectures and conferences, and by the publication of a monthly
journal designed to enable leading authorities to report on developments of
public as well as specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts
and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its
character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy
and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today the Royal
Institution has extensive laboratories which undertake research on subjects
including fast chemical kinetics, photosynthesis and solar energy. Lectures
are given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge
with particular emphasis on encouraging young people to take an interest in
science.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as by
eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures, exhi¬
bitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publication
of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, and the appointment of study
groups. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists (dealing with the physical, biological and sociological sciences) to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has made an important contribution to the development of
science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery
and application of scientific knowledge.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which promote their own disciplines or are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. The Council of Engineering Institu¬
tions, the federal body for the chartered engineering institutions, promotes the
co-ordination of the engineering profession. The Council of Science and
Technology Institutes is a federal body with five member institutes represent¬
ing biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists and physicists.
A Fellowship of Engineering, envisaged as complementary to the Royal
Society and forming an independent and authoritative forum of eminent
engineering opinion, was set up in 1976. The founder members were Fellows
of the Royal Society, together with a number of other distinguished engineers
who were selected by the chairman of the Council of Engineering Institu¬
tions and the presidents of the individual engineering institutions. Further
Fellows, up to a total of 1,000, but not more than 60 in one year, are being
elected.

There are at least two bodies primarily concerned with the relationship
between science and society: the British Society for Social Responsibility in
Science; and the Council for Science and Society, formed by specialists in the
natural and social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate
research into the social effects of scientific and technological development.
The Zoological Society of London, whose main function is as a scientific
organisation, runs the world-famous London Zoo, opened in 1828, which
occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. In 1931 the Society
opened Whipsnade Park Zoo near Dunstable (Bedfordshire) where over 2,000
animals roam a 200-hectare (500-acre) park. Comparative studies are under¬
taken in pathology, biochemistry, radiology and infectious diseases, and in the
reproductive processes of mammals. The Society also organises scientific
meetings and symposia for zoologists, publishes scientific journals and main¬
tains one of the largest zoological libraries in the world. At the end of 1979 the
Society’s collections at London Zoo and Whipsnade included 2,153 mammals,
2,037 birds, 379 reptiles, 208 amphibians, 2,896 fishes and 3,822 inverte¬
brates. Other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley, Chessington and Jersey. There are also a number of ‘safari parks’
containing reservations of wild animals through which the public can pass in
closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is one of the world’s principal centres
for the general study of natural history, particularly for specialised research
into taxonomy. It has five scientific departments: botany, entomology,
mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. It possesses extensive collections of
extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The
Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain. The geology of Britain is probably known in
more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the Institute
of Geological Sciences has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geologi¬
cal Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
Britain is represented on the European Community’s Scientific and Technical
Research Committee, the object of which is to co-ordinate national policies on
these matters and to implement joint projects of interest to the Community,
and the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Other inter¬
governmental organisations involved in scientific co-operation with which
Britain is concerned include: European Co-operation in Science and Tech¬
nology; specialised agencies of the United Nations such as the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation; the International Atomic
Energy Agency; the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy
Agency of the OECD; the European Organisation for Nuclear Research; the
European Space Agency; the European Molecular Biology Laboratory; the
International Agency for Research on Cancer; and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation Science Committee. Among non-governmental organisations
Britain is represented in the international unions comprising the International
Council of Scientific Unions (see p 392). The five research councils, the Royal
Society and the British Academy were founder members of the European
Science Foundation set up in 1974. Since 1968 Britain has signed over 30
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES

The Overseas
Development
Administration
The British
Council
intergovernmental agreements with other countries on co-operation in science
and technology or technical co-operation. These agreements are usually
intended to promote mutually beneficial exchanges and are administered by
various government departments.
There are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies in Washington,
Paris, Bonn, Moscow and Tokyo who among other things promote contacts in
science and technology between Britain and the countries to which they are
accredited. These counsellors serve all central government departments con¬
cerned in overseas scientific affairs, as well as the research councils and the
Royal Society, which is the main representative of Britain in areas of non¬
governmental collaboration. Administrative support for the counsellors is
provided in Britain by the Department of Industry’s Overseas Technical
Information Unit.
The Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the Foreign and Com¬
monwealth Office promotes scientific activities in the interests of developing
countries. These include research covering a wide range of disciplines,
specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences for exchange of
information, training scientists from overseas in universities and research
institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and providing
support for existing research services and research projects overseas. Equip¬
ment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage scientific
training. The ODA has four scientific units which are wholly engaged on aid to
developing countries: the Centre for Overseas Pest Research, the Directorate
of Overseas Surveys, the Land Resources Development Centre and the Tropi¬
cal Products Institute. In 1979 the ODA spent £n-i million on scientific
activities including research for the benefit of developing countries. Over 700
research and development projects to improve life in the developing countries
are being supported; many are concerned with agriculture or medicine.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p 71) in science (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to identify and manage
development projects in the technological, scientific and educational sectors.
There are 70 staff overseas with science qualifications who work to advance
technological, educational and scientific development, and collaboration with
Britain. One of their priorities is to make British expertise available, increas¬
ingly through consultancy schemes; others are to establish research and
development facilities, to provide trained manpower, and to assist with the
establishment of technical teaching institutes.
Interchange of scientists, technologists and educationalists is considered to
be of prime importance. British specialists in a very wide range of subjects are
sent overseas to advise on research and development and on teaching, and to
give courses of lectures, while scientists, technologists and technical teachers
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, technical teaching
institutes, teacher training colleges, education authorities, schools or cur¬
riculum reform centres.
The Council invites senior overseas people to Britain and arranges pro¬
grammes of visits or attachments. It makes its own awards for postgraduate
study in Britain and supervises programmes for senior specialists and students
who come to Britain through the United Nations agencies or bilateral technical

assistance schemes. The Council administers the Academic Links and Inter¬
change Scheme, the Academic Links with Eastern Europe Scheme and a
number of smaller programmes in support of academic collaboration between
institutions of higher education in Britain and other countries. Professional
courses organised by the Council in various parts of Britain for overseas
specialists include science and medicine. At the Council’s headquarters in
London, extensive professional, advisory and information facilities covering
education, medicine, science, technology and science education support its
work overseas.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science (through the Science Research Council),
the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Industry
according to the nature of the project. Expenditure on space activities in 1979
was about £60 million.
Britain is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) together with
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The
Department of Industry is responsible for leading the British delegation to the
ESA and for British participation in the space application programmes of the
Agency consisting of the development of telecommunication, meteorological
and maritime satellites and Spacelab, a manned laboratory to be carried aboard
the United States Space Shuttle. Development and production of equipment
for the ESA’s ‘Ariane’ launcher is undertaken through a bilateral agreement
with France. The Department of Industry is also responsible for industrial
sponsorship of Britain’s space industry. It participates in a joint departmental
industry technology programme designed to improve Britain’s industrial
capability in space application systems; the programme is supervised on behalf
of the Department by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence.
The Space Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough
also undertakes long-term research and development to assist industry, and
collates and disseminates data on remote sensing.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for the
use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites, including
those of Intelsat (see p 324).
The British civil scientific space research programme is the responsibility of
the Department of Education and Science through the SRC. The latter
provides Britain’s representatives and financial contribution for the ESA’s
scientific satellite programme. Scientific research, notably in astronomy, space
and the earth’s atmosphere, using satellites, rockets and balloons, is supported
by the SRC (see p 385). There are bilateral arrangements with other countries,
notably the United States through its National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA). British experiments have provided information
which has helped to increase scientific knowledge, especially in astronomy and
astrophysics, and to interpret climatic patterns. The British Ariel V scientific
satellite found several hundred new X-ray sources in space and the Ariel VI
satellite, launched in 1979, produced more detailed information on these
sources. The SRC’s Rutherford and Appleton Laboratories provide support
and services for the universities’ space-based experiments and also operate the
NASA Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station at Winkfield (Berk¬
shire). Winkfield is also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for
space research.
21 Promotion of the Arts
Arts Councils
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest standards of
professional performance to the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for music, drama, opera
and dance; and festivals held in Bath, Cheltenham, Edinburgh and other
towns and cities are also well known. Many British playwrights, composers,
sculptors, painters, writers, actors, singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy
international reputations. At an amateur level, activities which make use of
local talent and resources take many forms. Amateur choral, orchestral, opera¬
tic, dramatic and other societies for the arts abound; and increasing numbers of
people take an interest in crafts such as pottery, weaving and woodwork.
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities take an active part,
and a substantial and increasing amount of help also comes from private
sources, including trusts and commercial concerns. Policies towards support
for the arts are broadly similar, however, and there are two main aims. One is to
maintain and improve the traditional arts and cultural heritage, and to make
them more accessible to greater numbers of people. The other is to provide
financial aid to working artists and craftsmen, and to encourage more people to
take part in creative leisure pursuits.
Ministerial responsibility for general arts policy is borne by the Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, a member of the Cabinet, at the Office of Arts and
Libraries; the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
are also concerned with cultural matters. In addition, the Government is
responsible for the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic buildings, and
grants are made towards the maintenance of privately owned historic buildings
(see p 178).
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the central government education departments. They are concerned, in part¬
nership with local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with arts educa¬
tion in schools, further education colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres, and with the public library service.
Most government support for the arts takes the form of grants to independent
agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of Great Britain,
established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are to develop and
improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to increase
their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with government
departments, local authorities and other organisations.
Government allocations to the Arts Council in 1980-81 amount to £70
million. The Council gives financial help and advice to large numbers of
organisations, from the major opera, dance and drama companies, orchestras
and festivals, to the smallest touring theatres and experimental groups.
The Council encourages such diverse interests as contemporary dance,
photography and art films, and helps professional creative writers, choreo¬
graphers, composers, artists and photographers through bursary and award

schemes. It promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and drama
companies. Funds are provided for specialist training courses in the arts and
for help with the construction of new buildings or improvements to existing
theatres, concert halls and other arts buildings under its ‘Housing the Arts’
scheme.
Members of the Council are appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the
Council itself allocates subsidies to the main professional arts-promoting
organisations. Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies
from the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils which are committees of the Arts
Council of Great Britain with a large measure of autonomy.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with aims and
functions similar to those of the Arts Council of Great Britain. It receives an
annual grant from the Northern Ireland Department of Education.
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature
overseas (see p 71), and maintains libraries in most of the countries in which it
is represented. The Council may initiate or support overseas tours by British
theatre companies, orchestras, choirs and opera and dance companies, as well
as by individual actors, musicians and artists. It promotes fine arts and other
exhibitions overseas, and organises British participation in international exhi¬
bitions. The Council distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films,
many of them on the arts, and encourages professional interchange in all
cultural fields between Britain and other countries.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the inde¬
pendent television and radio programme companies and the Independent
Broadcasting Authority (IBA). The BBC has orchestras employing many of
the country’s full-time professional musicians, and each week it broadcasts
some 80 hours of serious music (both live and recorded) on its Radio 3 channel.
It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Independent television com¬
panies make grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions, particularly to
regional arts associations, and transmit general magazine programmes on the
arts. Both the BBC and IB A broadcast a wide range of new drama together
with adaptations of novels and stage plays. They also screen a variety of feature
films including British and overseas productions.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their respon¬
sibilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertain¬
ment in all its forms. Many authorities make contributions to regional arts
associations (see below) and towards the expenses of professional symphony
orchestras and local theatre companies. Grants are often made towards the
capital cost of new arts buildings, especially theatres; the Greater London
Council, for example, made a substantial contribution towards the cost of the
National Theatre.
It is part of the Government’s arts policy to give firm encouragement to
voluntary sponsorship of the arts. Valuable support comes from many volun¬
tary sources including charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’

organisations of the major national institutions. Industrial and commercial
concerns offer a growing source of patronage, and the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts and the Arts Council both advise interested com¬
panies. Sponsorship may take the form of grants to local arts festivals, theatres
and orchestras, and donations towards individual cultural events. Tax advan¬
tages and exemptions are available to encourage such support.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is encouraged through 17 regional arts
associations in England and Wales whose aim it is to ensure that the whole
range of the arts is more widely available to people throughout their areas.
They can offer financial assistance to local and other regional arts organisations
and advise on and promote all sorts of local arts activities. They are financed by
a combination of local authority, Arts Council and private funds; local
authorities and a wide range of other interests are represented on the associa¬
tions. Other examples of co-operative patronage are the orchestra boards
which support symphony and chamber orchestras and the societies formed to
present some of the many arts festivals in Britain.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for more than 200 professional
arts festivals which take place each year. Most are subsidised by a combination
of local authority, regional arts association and private funds, while the major
ones receive direct Arts Council assistance. Some arts festivals concentrate
particularly on music. These include: the Three Choirs Festival which has
taken place annually for more than 250 years in Gloucester, Worcester or
Hereford; the Cheltenham Festival which is largely devoted to contemporary
British music; and the Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Others cater for a number
of art forms; among the better known are the Edinburgh International Festi¬
val, the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, and those held in Bath, Brighton,
Buxton, Malvern, Harrogate, Salisbury, Windsor and York. A festival is held
in Belfast under the auspices of Queen’s University.
There are some 200 arts centres in Great Britain and the number is increasing
steadily. They provide opportunities for enjoyment of and participation in the
arts. The centres are supported mainly by regional arts associations and local
authorities with some help from the Arts Council and other organisations.
They may be small centres for amateur activities or they may offer a profes¬
sional programme. A growing number of theatres and art galleries also provide
a focal point for the community by offering facilities for other arts.
The author of any original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is
automatically protected by the Copyright Act 1956 and its related international
conventions1 from the unauthorised reproduction of the work both before and
after publication. The author of the work is the first owner of the copyright,
and the normal term of copyright in published original works is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after his or her death.
Britain is one of the world’s major theatre centres. As well as theatre in London
and the regions a network of informal touring companies has developed, which
visit many of the new arts centres and community festivals.

Support for much of this development in British drama comes jointly from
the Government, through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, from local authorities and regional arts associations, and from some
private sponsorship. In particular the Arts Council assists developments in
new drama by encouraging co-operation between theatres and playwrights by
means of bursaries, commissions and guaranteed royalties. Schemes are also in
operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians, actors and those
wishing to take up theatre administration.
Over 250 theatres in professional use in Britain can each accommodate more
than 200 people. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distributing com¬
panies, the majority of which receive Arts Council subsidies, while the
remainder are operated commercially or owned by local authorities.
London is the centre of theatrical activity with some 50 principal theatres in
or near the centre and 20 in the suburbs. Most are let to producing manage¬
ments on a commercial basis, but five are occupied by major subsidised
companies. These include the National Theatre which stages classical and
modern plays from various countries in its three auditoria on the south bank of
the River Thames, the Royal Shakespeare Company which presents Shake¬
spearean plays at Stratford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire in London, and
the Old Vic Company, Britain’s major theatrical touring company, which has a
London base in the famous Old Vic theatre.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. (Both the National Theatre and
Royal Shakespeare companies have toured in Britain and overseas.) A decline
in the number of these theatres has been checked in response to the demand by
audiences outside London for the larger opera, dance and drama companies.
Some theatres have been bought by local authorities. Many non-repertory
theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and many also put on
variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however, been a growth in
the activities of over 40 resident theatre companies which receive financial
support from the Arts Council and the local authorities. These companies
employ leading producers, designers and actors, and standards are high. Some
companies have their own theatres, others rent from local authorities.
There is no censorship of plays, but the Theatres Act 1968 makes it an
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as one
which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend it’.
Provision is made for a defence against an obscenity charge on the grounds that
the performance is for the public good in the interests of, for example, drama,
opera or literature.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, other public bodies, and four special
organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama Confer¬
ence, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of Ulster
Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs and
societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the best
known are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of Speech
and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the

Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the Old
Vic School in Bristol. There is the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow; and in Cardiff, the Welsh College of Music and Drama.
Several universities offer major courses in drama.
Theatre for young people is becoming increasingly popular and concessionary
ticket schemes are operated to encourage young people to attend theatres. In
1970 the Young Vic was opened as a theatre for young people, the National
Youth Theatre is based in London, and the Scottish Youth Theatre was
established in 1970. There are some 10 specialist companies, including the
Unicorn Theatre for Young People, Theatre Centre and the Polka Company,
some of which are supported by the Arts Council. Outside London about 30
repertory companies provide programmes and other types of theatre activity
for young people.
Most of the many amateur youth theatres in Britain are supported by local
authorities. Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some
education in drama. The London education service provides special drama
centres for young people.
Music plays an important role in British cultural life. Pop music, folk music,
jazz, light music and brass bands all have substantial followings while the
widespread interest in classical music is reflected in the large audiences at
choral and orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, dance and
chamber music.
The Arts Council offers subsidy (together with financial assistance from
local authorities and commercial sponsors) to orchestras, opera and dance
companies, music societies and festivals. It also provides bursaries and com¬
missions for composers, musicians, designers and choreographers. The
Master of the Queen’s Music holds an office within the Royal Household, with
responsibility for organising and writing music for State occasions.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities. In central London the principal concert halls are the Royal
Festival Hall, adjacent to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room accommodating smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall,
where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; the Wig-
more Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony,
the Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster and the Scottish National. The BBC
runs a number of orchestras, including four symphony orchestras, providing
broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle
upon Tyne), the Scottish Baroque Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. Most orchestras (other than those of the BBC) receive financial aid
from the Arts Councils, local authorities and industrial sources.
Among the principal choral societies are the Bach Choir, the Royal Choral
Society, the Swansea Philharmonic Choir, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union

and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have
close links with particular choirs, such as the Philharmonia Chorus and the
London Symphony Chorus, though these choirs are mostly independent of the
orchestras. The majority of choral societies are affiliated to the National
Federation of Music Societies.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by county music committees
(some of them voluntary and some sub-committees of local education
authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and
united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The National Federa¬
tion of Music Societies (the organisation for chamber music societies, amateur
choirs and orchestras) receives Arts Council funds to help affiliated societies
with the cost of engaging professional musicians. Some 1,200 music societies
are members of the Federation, which advises them on concert planning and
promotion. The Welsh Amateur Music Federation, funded by the Welsh Arts
Council, assists amateur music-making in Wales.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts
Council and from private and business sponsorship. The Royal Opera House
has a permanent orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal
Ballet. Both organisations have a high international reputation. Seasons of
opera and operetta in English are given by the English National Opera which
performs in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial tours supplemented
by the English National Opera North based in Leeds. Sadler’s Wells Theatre
houses most of the London performances of visiting opera and dance com¬
panies and the Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet which performs in London and the
regions. Scottish Opera has regular winter seasons at its permanent home, the
Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in Scotland and northern
England, while the Welsh National Opera has four quarterly seasons at the
New Theatre, Cardiff and at the Hippodrome Theatre, Birmingham, and
tours chiefly in Wales and the west of England.
An opera season, for which international casts are specially assembled, is held
every summer at Glyndebourne in Sussex; this is followed with an autumn
tour by Glyndebourne Touring Opera with different casts. Other opera
companies include Kent Opera, the English Music Theatre Company
which specialises in the performance of works by British composers, and
the New Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Northern Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group. A new touring
company, Opera 80, financed mainly by the Arts Council, started production
in 1980.
Dance companies also include London Festival Ballet, Ballet Rambert
(Britain’s oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading modern
dance company), Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow, London Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively) and Northern Ballet Theatre (which
concentrates its activities in the north of England, although it makes periodic
tours elsewhere).
There are several modern dance groups based in the regions with support
from their regional arts associations. They include Ludus, East Anglian
Dance Theatre, Merseyside Dance Trust, and Lynx Dance in Education

Team. About a dozen mime groups or soloists are assisted by the Arts
Council.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music in
London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are
grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and
the Birmingham School of Music. The National Opera Studio provides
advanced training courses. The leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet
School, the Rambert School of Ballet and the London School of Contemporary
Dance which, with many private schools, have helped in raising British dance
to its present high standard. Dance is now a subject for degree studies.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendances by young people at opera, dance and con¬
cert performances. Ballet for All, previously a branch of the Royal Ballet and
now run by the Royal Academy of Dancing, presents lecture-demonstrations
on classical ballet to young audiences. Scottish Ballet Workshop, the educa¬
tional branch of Scottish Ballet, works in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take
the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestras of Great Britain and of Wales and other youth
orchestras are noted for their high standards. Almost a third of the players in
the European Community Youth Orchestra come from Britain.
British films, actors and the creative and technical services which support
them have achieved successes in international film festivals and other
events. Cinema and television films are exported to most countries.
There are about 1,600 cinema screens in Great Britain, and estimated
attendances in 1979 amounted to 112 million. Cinema attendance figures have
been declining since the mid-1950s as television has become generally access¬
ible. In 1953 the average weekly cinema audience was some 25 million; by 1979
it was less than 10 per cent of that figure.
An Interim Action Committee is studying the future of the film industry.
Among the ideas being considered is the establishment of a British Film
Authority.
The Government does not invest directly in films but the National Film
Finance Corporation lends money for production and distribution of feature
films from capital advanced by the Government and private interests, and also
provides loans for script-writing and other pre-production costs.
A levy on cinema admissions, the Eady Levy, provides a fund to benefit the
makers of eligible films. Grants from the levy can be made to the Children’s
Film Foundation, the British Film Institute Production Board, the National
Film School, and the National Film Finance Corporation. The rest of the fund
is distributed to makers of eligible films in proportion to a film’s takings.
A specified number of British or European Community films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota is 30 per cent and
for supporting programmes, 25 per cent.
Local authorities have powers to license cinemas and censor films. They have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of children under the age of 16 to unsuit¬
able films, and may also exercise censorship over films for adults. In consider¬
ing the suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an
4°4 BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
independent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to which most films for
public showing are submitted.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912, on the initiative of the
cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the films
offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written code of
censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film;
very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are put into one of
four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general exhibition but
parents are advised that the film contains material which they may not wish
children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of not less than 14
years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years of age).
The Government is considering the report, published in December 1979, of
the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship (see Bibliography).
Documentary The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain was founded in
Films 1929 when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and
imaginative kind for the Government, and later for commercial organisations.
The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then, British
documentary technicians have continued to produce, for both cinema and
television, high quality factual films which have won numerous international
awards. The British Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the
use of films in industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised
Film Associations is the trade association of documentary, short, industrial,
advertising and cartoon film makers. The National Panel for Film Festivals,
under the aegis of the British Council, is responsible for the selection of British
entries for international short and documentary film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of documentary films for use
non-theatrically and on television in Britain and overseas. They are produced
through the Central Office of Information (COI), and the majority are com¬
missioned from private companies. There are several major documentary film
libraries, including the COI’s Central Film Library, which provides films on
hire or free of charge to a wide variety of educational, industrial and other
users. The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of films
covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Children’s Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from local
Films authorities which may impose conditions. There are about 220 cinemas provid¬
ing programmes for children on Saturday mornings. An important contribu¬
tion to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film Foundation, which,
with aid from the British Film Fund Agency, produces and distributes enter¬
tainment films specially designed for children.
British Film The development of the film and television as an art is promoted by the British
Institute Film Institute, founded in 1933 and financed mainly by a government grant,
and by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology which also receives a
government grant. The Institute offers financial and technical help to new and
experienced film makers who cannot find support elsewhere. The Institute
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive and has a library from which films may be hired; it also has a library of
scripts and books on the film and television, a British National Film Catalogue
recording all non-fiction and short films available in Britain, and an informa¬
tion service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the British
Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Tele-
Training in

vision. The Institute’s Educational Department offers guidance to teachers in
formal education at all levels on film and television courses, and its Editorial
Department produces a range of publications including a critical journal Sight
and Sound and the Monthly Film Bulletin.
The National Film Archive contains nearly 40,000 films, including news¬
reels and other miscellaneous items, and 5,000 television programmes, besides
art designs and posters; it also has over 1 million photographic stills, selected to
illustrate the history and the art of the film and television.
The National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding
historical, artistic or technical interest. It is unique as a cinema offering regular
programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or
nationality of the films shown. Each year it organises the London Film
Festival. The British Film Institute has promoted the development of some 50
regional film theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and may make
grants towards their costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council, as a
committee of the Scottish Council for Educational Technology, is responsible
for regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
An independent National Film School financed primarily by grants from the
Office of Arts and Libraries and the British Film Fund Agency, offers three-year
courses for writers, directors, producers and cameramen. Training in film
production is also given at the London International Film School, the Royal
College of Art, and at some polytechnics and other institutions.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been fostered by improved methods of display in museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, private galleries and the
growing number of local arts centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of mainten¬
ance and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase
grants for municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government also encourages high standards of industrial
design and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.
In addition to direct State assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the
Serpentine Gallery, which mainly presents the work of young artists. The
Council maintains its own collection of contemporary British art, and organ¬
ises or offers grants or guarantees for a variety of touring and other exhibitions.
It also supports art societies and independent galleries, and provides commis¬
sions and awards for artists. A number of photography galleries receive Arts
Council support, including the Side Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, the
largest gallery in Britain devoted entirely to photography. The Scottish and
Welsh Arts Councils have art galleries in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Cardiff
respectively, and the Northern Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered by
export control: these are works of art and collectors’ items over 50 years old and
worth more than £8,000 (more than £2,000 in the case of British historical
portraits); photographic material over 60 years old and worth more than £200;

documentary material over 50 years old; and British archaeological material
over 50 years old. A licence is required before such items can be exported, but
this is granted automatically in the case of objects imported into Britain within
the last 50 years. In other cases the application for a licence is considered by the
Department of Trade, and if the Department’s expert advisers recommend the
withholding of a licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on
the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee considers a work to be of national
importance it can advise the Government to withhold the export licence for a
specified time to give a public museum or art gallery an opportunity to offer to
buy the object at a fair price.
About 1,000 museums and art galleries are open to the public including the
major national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions.
Taken together, the national museums and art galleries in London contain
among the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeologi¬
cal, scientific, historical and general interest to be found within any one city.
They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the
National Maritime Museum, the Museum of London, the Wallace Collection,
the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological Museum and the
Science Museum.
Some of these national museums have also opened branches outside
London, examples being the National Railway Museum at York which is
administered by the Science Museum, and portrait collections at Montacute
House (Somerset) and Beningborough Hall (Yorkshire), administered by the
National Portrait Gallery in collaboration with the National Trust.
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed and has recently opened an Industrial
and Maritime Museum in Cardiff’s dockland. It also has a branch museum (the
North Wales Quarrying Museum) at Llanberis in Gwynedd. In Northern
Ireland there are two national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the
Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, County Down.
Most of the national collections are administered by trustee bodies, but the
Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the responsibility of the Office
of Arts and Libraries; the Royal Scottish Museum is the responsibility of the
Scottish Education Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (housed in the
Tower of London), the Public Record Office and Sir John Soane’s Museum.
In Buckingham Palace the Queen’s Gallery has exhibitions of pictures from the
extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local authorities, but sometimes by local
learned societies or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge are
rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities (for example,

the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the country,
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). There are important museums
and art galleries in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Dundee,
Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Reading, Shef¬
field, Southampton and York. Many private art collections housed in historic
family mansions, including those owned by the National Trust, are open to the
public. An increasing number of open air museums depict the regional life of
an area or preserve early industrial remains (for example, the Weald and
Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England Open Air Museum in
Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire which won the
first European Museum of the Year Award in 1978).
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting administrative and maintenance costs, the Government provides
annual purchase grants (£10-4 million in 1980-81). It may also provide special
purchase grants. An independent National Heritage Memorial Fund provides
assistance to organisations wishing to acquire land, buildings, works of art and
other objects associated with the national heritage. Ministerial responsibility
for accepting pre-eminent works of art in place of capital transfer tax is shared
by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary of State for the
Environment.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or
endowments, receive help in building up their collections through the annual
government grants administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal
Scottish Museums. Financial and practical assistance is also given to museums
and galleries by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste Gulbenk-
ian Foundation, the National Art-Collections Fund, the Contemporary Art
Society and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Standing Commission on
Museums and Galleries, which also promotes co-operation between national
and provincial institutions. Eight area museum councils, grant-aided by the
Government, provide technical services and advice on conservation, display,
documentation and publicity.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas mem¬
bers, is an independent organisation. It serves as a focus for the collection of
information and discussion of matters relating to museum administration, and
as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions provided by the Arts Councils, the national museums
and galleries, the Art Exhibitions Bureau and the area museum councils are a
regular feature of many museums. In London the Hayward Gallery, the Tate
Gallery, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal
Academy are the main centres for loan exhibitions; these are also held at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Con¬
temporary Arts. Commercial exhibitions are held in the galleries of the
London dealers. The Serpentine Gallery in London’s Kensington Gardens
houses Arts Council exhibitions of contemporary artists, and another small
gallery in London is run by the Crafts Council.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.

An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
children’s exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, further
education colleges and polytechnics, which are administered by local educa¬
tion authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include
universities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At
postgraduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own
degrees. Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central
(Art) Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department.
The leading academic institutions for the study of the history of art are the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the University of London, and the
Department of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London.
Art has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through
Art encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition. Pictures
may also be borrowed from many public libraries.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £1 -2 million in 1980-81,
are administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Council (formerly the
Crafts Advisory Committee). Set up in 1971 to advise the minister responsible
for the arts on the needs of artist-craftsmen, the Council holds regular exhi¬
bitions of work at its gallery in London and also publishes the bi-monthly
magazine Crafts which features crafts activities in Britain and abroad. It also
gives financial assistance to enable craftsmen to be trained and to establish or
expand their businesses. Its activities include crafts associated with conserva¬
tion and restoration. It runs a comprehensive information service and houses a
slide-index. The Council manages the craft shop at the Victoria and Albert
Museum which sells a selection of works by British artist-craftsmen. Scotland
receives a separate government grant which is similarly administered by the
Joint Crafts Committee. The British Craft Centre in London, which receives
an annual grant from the Crafts Council, aims to increase public recognition,
enjoyment, and support of the work of artist-craftsmen, and holds ten exhi¬
bitions a year (most of the contents of which are for sale).
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned mainly
with encouraging the best in new building and conserving the best that has
been inherited from the past (for conservation, see p 178).
Several government departments, notably the Department of the Environ¬
ment, provide advice on building and architecture. In collaboration with the
Royal Institute of British Architects, the Secretary of State for the Environ¬
ment makes annual awards for good housing design in both the public and
private sectors. Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for
Scotland advise the departments, planning authorities and other public bodies
on questions of public amenity or artistic importance.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional institu¬
tion with a membership of 21,216 in Britain and 5,216 overseas. It exercises
control over standards in architectural education, and maintains one of the
largest architectural libraries in the world. The Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland is allied to it.
Other bodies with an interest in architecture include the Civic Trust (see
p 188) which promotes high standards in civic building and planning, and the

National Trusts (see p 188) which acquired land and buildings in order to
protect them from harmful development for the benefit of the public. The
number of people visiting National Trust properties rose from just over a
million in i960 to more than 6-2 million in 1979.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges and
universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and many private literary societies. Book reviews are featured in the
press and on television and radio and there are numerous periodicals concerned
with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is provided by a
number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith & Son, and Whitbread
prizes and Arts Council National Book Awards. Awards to encourage young
writers are made for instance, by the Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the
E. C. Gregory Trust Fund.
Government help is given through the Arts Councils which support litera¬
ture in a number of ways, including grants awarded to writers, translators,
publishers, small presses and magazines. Legislation passed in 1979 provides
for a scheme to give authors the right to receive payment from government
funds for the use of their books borrowed from public libraries. Payments are
expected to start in 1982. The title Poet Laureate is conferred on a poet who
receives a stipend as an officer of the Royal Household.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies (known as the British
Academy) is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a govern¬
ment grant.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the Bib¬
liographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, the largest of which is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies, for example, the Poetry Society and the
Apollo Society, sponsor poetry readings and recitals. There are also a number
of clubs and societies, such as the New Fiction Society and the Poetry Book
Society, which distribute selected new books to their members.
In 1979 British publishers issued nearly 42,000 separate titles: more than
32,000 new ones, and over 9,000 reprints and new editions. An increasing
proportion of books—including specialised non-fiction—is sold in paperback
form. Book clubs make available hardback books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through its libraries in 63 countries, its programme of book exhi¬
bitions (287 exhibitions were mounted in 1979-80) and its bibliographical
publications including the monthly British B(x>k News. The Book Develop¬
ment Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books
in 1979 see p 253). The National Book League has a membership including
authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages an
interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
The British Library, created in 1973 from a merger of the British Museum
Library with other libraries and institutions, is organised in three divisions.
The Reference Division, which receives a copy of each new book, pamphlet or
410
Libraries in

newspaper published in Britain and acquires significant literature from other
countries, includes the Department of Printed Books holding about 10 million
titles, the Department of Manuscripts, the Department of Oriental Manu¬
scripts and Printed Books, and the Science Reference Library, which is the
national centre for patent documentation and contains more than 20 million
specifications worldwide. The Lending Division at Boston Spa, West York¬
shire, has 3-2 million volumes including some 54,000 current periodicals
available on loan to other libraries in Britain and overseas. It also has access to
many millions of books in other libraries and is the national centre for inter-
library lending within Britain and between Britain and foreign countries. The
Bibliographic Services Division processes the acquisitions of the British
Library for inclusion in its catalogues and publishes the British National
Bibliography which lists all new books and new editions published in Britain,
the British Catalogue of Music and other bibliographic records. It also provides
automated information services of bibliographic data for libraries and their
users throughout Britain. The Research and Development Department is a
major source of funding for the support of research and development in library
and information services in Britain. Plans for a new headquarters of the British
Library in London are under review. Under copyright legislation, the national
libraries of Scotland and of Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford University
and the Cambridge University Library are also entitled to claim copies of all
new British publications.
Some of the national museums also have large libraries, and many govern¬
ment departments have well-established libraries of considerable size and
importance. The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior
courts of law and of most government departments, as well as such famous
historical documents as Domesday Book. In Scotland the Scottish Record
Office serves the same purpose. The National Register of Archives (main¬
tained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local
and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as that of the London Library,
there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions (for
scientific societies and institutions, see p 392). Examples are the libraries of the
Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth Society,
the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the British
Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of Music, the National Library for
the Blind and the National Book League.
The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are unmatched by
any of the more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of
the colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 6 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some 2
million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh, Birmingham,
Glasgow and Leeds each have over 1 million volumes and a substantial number
have over half a million each. Many universities have built up large and
important research collections in special subjects; for example, the Barnes
Medical Library at Birmingham, and the British Library of Political and
Economic Science at the London School of Economics. Other universities and
the polytechnics are also building collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books.
Public Libraries

PROMOTION OF THE ARTS 411
Britain is served by a network of public libraries, administered by local public
library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 132-5 million
books (not including the libraries in publicly maintained schools).
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members of
public libraries. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is responsible for
the supervision of the public library service in England and is advised by the
Library Advisory Council for England. The Secretary of State for Wales has
responsibility for supervising of the public library service in Wales and is
advised by the Library Advisory Council for Wales. Public library authorities
in England and Wales have a duty to provide (with some limitations) a free
lending and reference library service of books and periodicals. In Scotland
local authorities must provide library facilities. In Northern Ireland the public
library service is the responsibility of the education and library boards which
also have a duty to make library services available to schools. There are some
5,700 public library service points in Britain; some areas are served by mobile
libraries of which about 700 are in service, and domiciliary services cater for
people who are unable to visit a library.
Many libraries have collections of records and musical scores for loan to the
public. Notable examples are the City of Westminster Central Music Library
and the Henry Watson Music Library at Manchester Central Library. A
number of libraries also lend from collections of works of art, either originals or
reproductions. Nearly all libraries provide children’s departments, while
reference sections and art, music, commercial and technical departments meet
the growing and more specific demands in these fields. Most libraries hold a
significant collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities; these may
include film shows, lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions,
drama groups, record recitals and children’s story hours.
A voluntary system of library co-operation exists in England and Wales
under which eight regional library bureaux (consisting mainly of public lib¬
raries in each area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of
current British books, achieved in some regions by a system of co-operative
subject specialisation.
A number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist titles and informa¬
tion involve industrial, commercial and sometimes university libraries, and are
normally centred on a major public or technical college library.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales carry out functions similar
to those of the regional bureaux and the Lending Division of the British
Library. In Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries
is available to the libraries controlled by the five education and library boards
and to the libraries of Queen’s University and the New University of Ulster.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association. It main¬
tains a Register of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and
official journals, and holds regular conferences. There are also associations of
libraries, for example, the Association of Special Libraries and Information
Bureaux and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries.
22 The Press
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional are sold per person in Britain
than in most other developed countries. Despite a slow but continuous decline
in national newspaper sales, on an average day nearly three out of four adults
over the age of 15 read a national morning newspaper and about one in two read
an evening newspaper. National papers have a total circulation of about 14-5
million on weekdays and 19 million on Sundays though the total readership is
considerably greater.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. It is subject neither to State control nor to censorship.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are almost always financially indepen¬
dent of any political party and are not obliged to follow any specific party line.
In order to preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and
periodicals are governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the under¬
taking in trustees, or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide
that the transfer of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have management
arrangements to ensure editors’ authority and independence.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and
magazine sales and advertising receipts are zero-rated for value-added tax
purposes. Registered newspapers receive a concession on postal rates, and
there are concessions on ‘per-word’ rates for international press telegrams
and photo-telegrams. In common with all postal customers, newspaper
and magazine publishers can obtain reductions in charges for regular bulk
postings.
There are 124 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers and over
1,000 weekly newspapers are published. These figures include certain
specialised papers with circulations limited not by region but by interest; for
instance, business newspapers, sporting newspapers, newspapers in foreign
languages for people of other countries resident in Britain and religious news¬
papers. Newsprint forms roughly a third of average national newspaper costs.
Three-quarters of Britain’s requirements are imported. The national news¬
paper industry is faced with a number of problems. Financial difficulties
(alleviated to some extent by improvements in advertising revenue) are further
complicated by problems of labour relations, often associated with the intro¬
duction of new production techniques.
Newspaper ownership, as it affects the national, London-evening and regional
daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the hands of a comparatively small
number of large press publishing groups (the groups controlling the national
press are listed in Table 38), but there are, in addition, some 200 independent
regional and local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with diversified interests over

the whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in
independent television and radio contracting companies; and others are
involved in industrial and commercial activities which have no connection with
publishing or the mass media.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are leading to
results which are contrary to the public interest, the Independent Broadcasting
Authority may, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies
that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There is a similar stipula¬
tion for independent local radio; if a local newspaper has a monopoly in the
area, it is not allowed to have a controlling interest in the local radio station. In
addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting,
with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more unless the
Secretary of State for Trade gives written consent. Except in certain limited
cases, which include transfers of very small newspapers, consent may be given
only after the Secretary of State has referred the matter to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission and received its report.
Ten morning daily papers and seven Sunday papers (see Table 38) circulate
throughout the country, and are known as national newspapers. All but one are
produced in London (where Fleet Street is the traditional centre for the press),
but six of the dailies and four of the Sundays also print northern editions in
Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of the total production of the
national press). An edition of the Financial Times is also printed in Frankfurt.
Prices of the national newspapers vary from xop to 25P for the dailies and i8p
to 3op for the Sundays.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland.
National newspapers are often thought of as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’
papers on the basis of differences in format (broadsheet or tabloid, though this
is not a rigid distinction), style and content. Four dailies and three Sundays are
usually described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities produce
colour supplements which are distributed as part of the paper.
The slow decline in newspaper circulations as a whole (from 37 million in
1970 to 33-5 million in 1980), conceals the different experiences of individual
papers and the fact that the circulation of some newspapers has remained
generally steady, while that of others has increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, over 70 morning or
evening dailies and Sundays and some 700 newspapers appearing once or twice
a week) provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give
coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their own
foreign news service. Generally, regional evening newspapers are non¬
political, while the morning newspapers adopt a more positive political stance
and tend to be independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is estimated at
over 7 million. Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and
the Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over 100,000 and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and
the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over 140,000

and 190,000 respectively. Individual circulation figures of regional
evening papers start at about 15,000; most are in the 30,000-100,000 range,
although the Manchester Evening News and the Birmingham Evening Mail have
circulations of over 330,000 and the Liverp<x)l Echo of over 240,000. Weekly
papers are mainly of local appeal; they are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000-40,000 range.
There are also many free distribution advertising newspapers (mostly
weekly), some published by orthodox newspaper publishers.
The London local weeklies (about 120) include papers for every district in
Greater London. They circulate in as many as six to eight local editions of
individual papers, affiliated in some cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; its circulation of just under 100,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north
Wales the Liverp(x)l Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area.
Evening papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the
South Wales Argus, Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the
Evening Leader, Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 29,000 and
117,000. North Wales is also served by the Liverpool Echo, the Shropshire Star
covers parts of mid- and north Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller extent
by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (over 50) includes English language papers, some of which
carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 92,000 and 720,000 are The
Scotsman published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald\ the Daily Record (sister
paper to the Daily Mirror); the Dundee Courier and Advertiser] the Aberdeen
Press and Journal-, and the Scottish Daily Express (published in Manchester).
The evening papers have circulations in the range of 16,000 to 192,000 and are
the Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and
the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday
Post and the Scottish Sunday Express (published in Manchester).
Weekly and local newspapers number about 140, of which the Hamilton
Advertiser and the Falkirk Herald have the largest circulations.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening and one Sunday
paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 50,000 to
156,000. They are the News-Letter (Unionist) and the Irish News (National¬
ist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News. There are 40 weekly
newspapers.
The size of the labour element in the costs of national and provincial news¬
papers continues to encourage publishers to look for ways of increasing pro- j
ductivity, often by use of the new composing technology which dispenses with
traditional ‘hot metal’ typesetting, with type set in molten lead, and employs
photographic methods to produce an image. It can combine photo-

The Periodical
Press
News Agencies
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The 4,900 periodical publications (including local freesheets) are classified as
‘general’, ‘specialised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also
about 640 ‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business
houses or public services for their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative’
press probably includes a further 500 titles, most of which are devoted to
radical politics, community matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV Times
which have circulations approaching 4 million and Woman's Weekly, Woman's
Own, Woman, Weekly News (which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly
with circulations in the 800,000 to i-6 million range. The leading journals of
opinion are The Economist, a politically independent publication covering
topics from a wider angle than its title implies; the New Statesman, which is a
review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political
tendency; the Spectator, which covers much the same subjects from an inde¬
pendent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which represents the views of the
left-wing of the Labour Party; New Society, covering the sociological aspects of
current affairs; and New Scientist, which reports on science and technology in
terms which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally the lead¬
ing humorous periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also devote
attention to public affairs. More recent publications include Financial Weekly,
a periodical for businessmen and investors and Now!, a weekly news magazine.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industry. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a consider¬
able circulation overseas and are an important medium for selling British
goods. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales
there are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both Welsh
and English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals, a
weekly paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals (of
which the most famous is probably Blackwcx)d’s), and numerous popular
magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly
publications covering farming, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics
and social work.
There are three principal British news agencies registered in Britain: Reuters
Ltd; The Press Association Ltd; and The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd, a world news organisation, is owned by four associations: the
Newspaper Publishers Association; The Press Association; the Australian
Associated Press; and the New Zealand Press Association. They are parties to a
trust deed which safeguards the independence and integrity of the news
service. Founded in Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851,

THE PRESS 417
Reuters employs 558 journalists and correspondents in 69 countries and ter¬
ritories, and has links with about 120 national or private news agencies, which
give it access to coverage by many hundreds of local reporters. Some 700,000
words of general news, sports, and economic reports are received in London
every day and are retransmitted to 153 countries and territories over a global
network of leased teleprinter lines, satellite links and cable and radio circuits.
These news services are specially tailored to the needs of recipients in Britain
and overseas, and are distributed to information media, either direct or
through national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services, one of the world’s
largest financial and business news services, supplies information to banks,
brokers and other commercial undertakings throughout the world by means of
computer-based video display units, teleprinters and bulletins.
The Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters and other international agencies with a
complete service of home news, including general and parliamentary news,
legal reports, and all branches of financial, commercial and sports news; and
includes in its services to regional papers the world news of Reuters and the
Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours a day from head office in
London over a network of lines leased from the Post Office—certain items
being available in teletypesetting form. Through its photographic department
The Press Association serves London and regional newspapers with a daily
picture service from home and overseas; these are wired to the regional press.
Its Special Reporting Service supplies reports of local or special interest to
daily and weekly papers and periodicals. Press Association Features provides
exclusive rights to syndicated articles and visual features.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Exchange
Telegraphy Company (Holdings) Ltd, a public company. It supplies financial
and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations, and to
private subscribers. In conjunction with The Press Association Ltd, racing
services are also supplied by telephone and video terminals to subscribers in
London and the provinces from offices throughout Britain.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Associ¬
ated Press Ltd, and by United Press International, which are British sub¬
sidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which rep¬
resents the principal press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course or direct recruitment by a regional or local
newspaper. Both categories of entrant take part in an apprenticeship scheme
consisting of ‘on-the-job’ training, and block release course's for those who have
not attended a pre-entry course. A number of centres provide courses for
reporters. Other training facilities include one-year postgraduate courses in
journalism at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff, and at the City

University (London), and courses provided by the Newspaper Society Train¬
ing Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as circulation, advertising,
industrial relations and management. The NCTJ co-operates closely with the
Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) which is respon¬
sible for training in printing, publishing and professional photography.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Harry Brittain Memorial
Fellowship Scheme, several young Commonwealth journalists each year spend
three months working and studying in Britain. The Thomson Foundation
holds training courses for journalists from all parts of the world and provides
consultants and tutors for courses in journalism held overseas.
Training for work with periodicals was traditionally done ‘on the job’ but
formal courses of instruction are becoming more widely available. The
London College of Printing offers a one-year pre-entry course in periodical
journalism as well as block- and day-release courses for those who have already
started work as trainees. In addition, several of the larger publishing houses
provide systematic training which includes periods in the classroom to sup¬
plement work experience. For publishers who do not offer training indepen¬
dently, a training group has been established under the auspices of the PPITB.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which rep¬
resents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines.
Organisations representing journalists are the Institute of Journalists (IOJ),
with about 2,250 members, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), with
more than 32,000 members. All practising journalists (including those
engaged in radio, television, public relations, freelance journalism and book
publishing editorial work) are eligible for membership of either. Four main
printing unions are concerned with the press.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors with about 500 members aims to
maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists.
The British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Press Council has a membership consisting of equal numbers of press and
non-press members, with an independent chairman. Its aims are: to preserve
the established freedom of the press; to maintain the character of the press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press (the
Council’s complaints committee comprises equal numbers of press and non¬
press members); to report on developments in the press which may tend
towards greater concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appro¬
priate occasions to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to
The Press and
the Law
THE PRESS 419
press organisations abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports
recording its work; and to review from time to time developments in the press
and the factors affecting them. The Council publishes annual reports, which
include statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles
examining the structure of the leading press groups.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
Apart from the requirements to register newspapers and periodicals under
the Newspaper Libel and Registration Act 1881, there are no specific press
laws but certain statutes include sections which apply to the press.1 These
relate to such matters as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and
radio companies; the transfer of newspaper assets; restrictions on the reporting
of preliminary hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and North¬
ern Ireland); the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of
local authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) certain details of
divorce, domestic and rape proceedings in courts of law, (b) legal proceedings
involving children, (c) advertisement and investment circulars, which are
governed by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descrip¬
tions of goods and services and with fraud, and (d) advertisements of remedies
for certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements
between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communi¬
cations, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain
types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
In certain circumstances, if the defence authorities and press representatives in
the Defence, Press and Broadcasting Committee agrees that publication of
information on particular topics would be detrimental to the national interest,
defence notices (‘D’ notices) are circulated confidentially to the news media
requesting that such information should not be published. Compliance with
these requests is expected, but they have no legal force. An internal review of
the ‘D’ notice system is being conducted by the committee.
Of particular relevance to the press are the laws on libel and contempt of
court. A newspaper may not publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice their reputation for fairness before or
during the actual proceedings nor may it publish before or during a trial
anything which might tend to influence the result. The obtaining and publica¬
tion of information from state and official sources of a confidential or security
nature is affected by the official secrets legislation. Newspapers are also liable
to proceedings for seditious libel and incitement to disaffection. The majority
of legal proceedings against the press are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publishers, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article concerned, may
all be held responsible.
1 A Government draft code of conduct on trade union closed shops has been issued under the
Employment Act 1980 (seep 338). Inrelation to the press the code considers the position of editors
and journalists and the essential freedom of the press to collect and publish information and to
publish comment and criticism.
23 Television and Radio
The British
Broadcasting
Corporation
All British broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service
accountable to the people through Parliament. Television and radio are the
responsibility of two broadcasting authorities, the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA),
which work to broad requirements and objectives placed on them by Parlia¬
ment, but are quite independent in the day-to-day conduct of business. This
independence carries with it certain obligations as to programmes and pro¬
gramme content. Each authority must ensure that its programmes display, as
far as possible, a proper balance and wide range of subject matter, impartiality
in matters of controversy and accuracy in news coverage, and also that pro¬
grammes do not offend against good taste. Codes of guidance on violence in
television programmes, particularly during hours when large numbers of
children are likely to be viewing, are operated by both authorities. A code of
advertising standards and practice is also operated by the IBA. There is no
advertising on BBC television and radio.
The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally under the Wireless
Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967 which prohibit the sending or receiving of
wireless communications except under licence. The Minister is answerable to
Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a number of
technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain, and
some 98 per cent of the population have access to television. It is estimated that
about 10 per cent of households have two or more receivers. Average viewing
time per person is over 172 hours a week. Practically every home also has radio,
and car radios and portable transistors have made radio, national and local, one
of the country’s major day-time diversions.
Citizens’ band radio has been publicly discussed for some time. In May 1980
the Home Secretary announced that a system known as ‘Open Channel’ would
be introduced following administrative and technical studies.
Households with television must buy a licence each year; they cost £12
for black and white and £34 for colour. Of over 18 million licences current in
May 1980 approximately 13 million were for colour and 5-3 million for black
and white television. The revenue from licences meets most of the cost of the
BBC’s domestic services. Independent television and independent local
radio are self-supporting, with revenue drawn from the sale of advertising
time.
The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the Royal Charter
and by a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation consists of 12 governors
(including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed by the Queen on the
advice of the Government. The governors are responsible for all aspects of
broadcasting. Committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of
television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, schools broadcasting,
further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and
TELEVISION AND RADIO
421
charitable appeals. There is also a programme complaints commission.1 The
governors appoint the Director General who is chairman of the BBC’s board of
management, which also includes the managing directors for television, radio
and external broadcasting, and the directors of personnel, finance, public
affairs and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by the income
from the sale of television licences. This is supplemented by profits from
trading activities, including television programme exports, the sale of records
and publications connected with BBC programmes, the hire and sale of
educational films, film library sales and exhibitions based on programmes and
other BBC activities. Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on
domestic services relates to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio
stations but some local education authorities help to make educational pro¬
grammes. The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant determined
each year by the Government. The general rise in costs is causing the BBC to
make a number of economies and reduce its output of both radio and television.
The I BA’s constitution and finances are governed by the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority legislation and a Licence. It consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and ten other members (three of whom have responsibility for Scot¬
land, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary. The IBA
does not produce radio or television programmes; these are provided by com¬
mercial programme companies. Its main functions are to appoint the companies,
to supervise programme arrangements, to control advertising and to build, own
and operate transmitting stations. The chief executive officer of the IBA, the
Director General, is supported by a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broadcast¬
ing, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review
Board reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the I BA’s
staff.1 Local committees advise on local radio services.
The I BA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the tele¬
vision and radio programme companies. The television programme companies
also pay to the IBA, for transfer to the Government, a levy related to their
profits. A similar levy on the profits of local radio contractors is proposed.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions; two companies share the
contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and the
other at the weekend. (New television contracts to run from January 1982 are
to be awarded by the IBA in December 1980.) The companies operate on a
commercial basis, deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The
financial resources, advertising revenue and programme production of the
1 It is proposed to establish a single complaints commission to deal with complaints of unfair
treatment or infringement of privacy against both the BBC and IBA.
422
Television
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
companies vary considerably, depending largely on the size of population in
the areas in which they operate. Although newspapers can acquire an interest
in programme companies, there are safeguards to protect public interest.
In consultation with the I BA, each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material
produced by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other pro¬
gramme companies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five
largest companies (Thames, ATY, Granada, Yorkshire and London
Weekend) provide more programmes for broadcast elsewhere on the national
network than do the smaller ones. A common news service is provided by
Independent Television News Ltd., a non-profit-making company in which
all the programme companies are shareholders. The negotiations concerning
the supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and their co-ordinated
transmission through the independent television network take place largely on
the Network Planning Committee which consists of representatives of all the
programme companies and of the IBA.
Local radio is broadcast by independent stations on the same principles. The
programme companies are under contract to the IBA, operate under its control
and are financed by advertising revenue. News coverage is supplied as a common
service by Independent Radio News.
Three television channels are in operation: BBC-i and ITV broadcasting
on both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines ultra high fre¬
quency (uhf), and BBC-2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only. Some 99
per cent of the population live within range of vhf, and almost 98 per cent
within range of uhf transmissions, which are still being extended. The vhf
transmissions are expected to cease within a few years. Most television sets are
designed to receive four channels, and the Government has decided that the
IBA shall be given responsibility for broadcasting on the fourth channel (see
below).
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. All BBC-2 programmes and the majority of
those on BBC-i are broadcast on the national network. Of the BBC’s 1978-79
television output over 44 per cent was produced in London and 35 per cent
elsewhere in Britain; about 14 per cent comprised feature films and series, and
I3'5 Per cent Open University programmes. Current affairs, features,
documentary, news, schools, further education, Open University and religi¬
ous programmes comprised about 45‘5 per cent of the total.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC-i presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, current affairs, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while
BBC-2 places greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger ele¬
ment of documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music, pro¬
grammes on pastimes and international films.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in
1955. ITV services are provided by the regional programme companies.
On average each of the 14 ITV areas transmitted about 100 hours of
television programmes a week in 1979-80, nearly two-fifths of which com¬
prised informative programmes—including news, documentaries, current
affairs, education and religion. Three-quarters of the programmes seen on
ITV are produced by the programme companies themselves. There is a

maximum of six minutes of advertising an hour on average, in three short
breaks.
Legislation has been introduced to establish a fourth television channel to be
operated by the IB A; the service is expected to begin in the autumn of 1982.
The IBA will be expected to ensure that the channel caters for tastes and
interests not normally provided for by the existing independent service. It
must provide a suitable proportion of educational programmes, encourage
innovation and experiment, and ensure that a substantial proportion of pro¬
grammes are provided otherwise than by the independent television com¬
panies. The companies will, however, finance the new service and in return
will have the right to sell advertising time in fourth channel programmes
broadcast in their region. In Wales the fourth channel is to be operated by a
new Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. A substantial proportion of pro¬
grammes will be in Welsh; evening broadcasting will be mainly in Welsh.
British television programmes have won many international awards, and the
country is one of the world’s foremost exporters of television productions. It is
estimated that Britain exported about £38 million-worth of television pro¬
grammes in 1978, and there are few countries in the world where British
programmes have not been shown.
Over 14 per cent of households with television rely on cable systems for the
reception of programmes. The systems are usually used to improve reception
quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local topography, or because
external aerials are not allowed in some residential buildings. There are cable
networks in almost every urban area; some cover a whole town, some homes
scattered throughout an area, and others individual housing estates. Of some
2-7 million subscribers to cable networks in 1980 about 1 -5 million subscribed
to commercial systems, 995,000 to systems operated by local authorities and
other non-commercial bodies, and some 99,000 to housing associations’
systems. Commercial relay operators are represented by The Cable Television
Association of Great Britain. All operators of cable systems are licensed by the
Home Secretary and the Post Office.
Since 1972 six experiments have been authorised by the Home Secretary for
local stations to distribute locally-originated television programmes by cable
systems to subscribers. Three stations are still in operation. At Greenwich in
London funds are provided by the local commercial cable television company,
while at Swindon they are provided by a number of non-commercial bodies
and from the promotion of a weekly lottery. At Milton Keynes the experimen¬
tal station provides a locally-originated programme service over the Post Office
cable system. All the experiments enable people to see programmes about local
activities and to have access to programme-making facilities under the guid¬
ance of the station staff. There are proposals for a Pay-TV experiment among
cable operators.
BBC Radio’s four national channels each have a distinct character. Radio 1
provides a programme of pop music, while Radio 2 provides light music as well
as being the principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides
mainly classical music (much of which is in stereo) and in the evening offers, in
addition, adult education programmes and works of artistic and intellectual
interest. Radio 4 is the main speech programme, providing the principal news
and information service and a wide range of drama, music, talks, entertain¬
ment and schools broadcasts. There are many stereo programmes.

BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local radio is provided by 20 BBC stations in England and by 19 indepen¬
dent stations distributed throughout Britain. Another 18 local radio stations
(nine BBC and nine IB A) are being established and approval has been given for
a further 15 (one BBC and 14 IBA). Local broadcasts provide a comprehensive
service of local news and information, music and other entertainment, educa¬
tion, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and offer residents a chance
to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
Four experiments in locally-initiated sound programmes over cable dis¬
tribution systems have been authorised. As in the case of the local community
cable television experiments an advertising service may be included if a station
elects to do so.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas (in 39 languages, including
English) for a total of some 705 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to project British life and culture.
News bulletins, current affairs programmes, political commentaries and topi¬
cal magazine programmes form the main part of the output. A full sports
service, music, drama, and general entertainment are also included.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from
this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in
determining the content of news and other programmes.
The foreign language services are divided into areas: the African, Arabic,
Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 63 hours a week in Arabic to 35 minutes in Maltese.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast
weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and recorded lessons
are supplied to between 250 and 300 stations in over 100 countries. English by
Television programmes are shown in more than 100 countries.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the
BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcrip¬
tion Service offers programmes to over 100 countries.
Another part of the External Services, the Monitoring Service, listens to and
reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news and
comment from overseas to the BBC, the press, and the Government.
Radio for overseas is also produced by the radio services of the Central Office
of Information (COI). A wide range of material is recorded on tape and sent to
radio stations in over 70 countries for transmission. In addition, COI television
services provide material such as documentary and magazine programmes for
distribution to overseas television stations.
The BBC’s domestic television and radio services operate more than 1,200
transmitters, and its external services from some 47 transmitters in Britain and
32 overseas. Most of the circuits used to link studios and transmitters are
rented from the Post Office. For its domestic radio, the BBC uses 100 studios
TELEVISION AND RADIO
425
in London and the regions, and for its external services 30 in London. In
addition, there are semi-automatic studios which can be operated by pro¬
gramme officials without engineering staff. Each of the BBC’s 20 local radio
stations has at least two studios. BBC television productions come from main
studios at the Television Centre in west London and other studios in various
parts of London, and six fully-equipped regional studio centres and eight
television studios in other towns. Outside broadcasting is covered by a number
of mobile units.
The IBA uses a total of 500 television and sound radio transmitting stations
throughout Britain, programme links being rented from the Post Office.
Independent television programmes are produced at 17 studio centres
throughout the country, reflecting the I BA’s policy of encouraging regional
television, and are designed for either local broadcasting or for national trans¬
mission. All companies have facilities for colour transmission.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest by
mentioning its name or branded products, except when it is necessary in order
to provide effective and informative programmes. Under the terms of its
Licence and Agreement it must not broadcast any commercial advertisement
or sponsored programme.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but there is no
sponsoring of programmes by advertisers. Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the amount of time given
to advertising must not be so great as to detract from the value of the pro¬
grammes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. In any
one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on independent
television is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s
programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent local
radio stations are normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising each
hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in
advertising on television and radio and giving guidance about the types and
methods of advertisement that may not be used. Some advertising is prohi¬
bited, notably that with a political or religious object or on behalf of cigarettes
or betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programme,
such as broadcasts to schools.
Government publicity material designed to support non-political campaigns
may be broadcast on independent radio and television. It is prepared through
the COI and is broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis.
Short public service items, mainly about health, safety and welfare themes,
are also produced by COI for free transmission by the BBC and independent
television and radio. The Government has no general access to radio or
television.
Parliamentary reporting includes a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament is
in session. Since 1978 proceedings of Parliament, including its committees,
have been broadcast on radio. Some occasions are broadcast live, and recorded
sound extracts may be included in both radio and television news and current
affairs programmes.
There is also frequent coverage of political subjects in news bulletins and
current affairs programmes on both radio and television. Ministerial and party
political broadcasts are transmitted periodically under the rules agreed
between the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA.

Technical
Developments
International
Relations
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Research into technical problems is carried out by scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, other government departments
and the radio industry. One of the most important recent developments has
been the introduction of smaller, lighter cameras and video recorders for use on
outside locations. ‘Electronic news gathering’ (ENG) equipment, whereby
pictures can be transmitted directly to a studio or recorded on videotape on
location, reduces significantly the time before an item can be broadcast. Other
developments include the use of magnetic tape on videotape recorders, the
increasing use of computers to generate graphical shapes such as captions and
credits, and the improvement of the quality of videotape pictures.
Advances by the BBC have included the electronic conversion of mono¬
chrome and colour television pictures between the European and the American
systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision system known as ‘sound-
in-syncs’ which enables the television sound and picture to be carried over a
single 625-line vision circuit, eliminating the operational complexity and
expense of a separate circuit for sound. IBA engineers were the first in the
world to introduce a fully digital field rate standards converter (DICE) to
improve the interchange of programmes between areas using the 525-lines
system (for example, North America) and those using the 625-lines system (for
example, Europe). Current IBA research projects include the development of
the first digital video tape recorder with economical use of tape, and a pro¬
gramme of research into the future use of space satellites for broadcasting.
(The Home Secretary has initiated a study into the implications of establishing
a direct broadcasting satellite service in Britain by about 1985. The study
covers the technical, financial and resource implications of such a service, the
implications for the existing broadcasting system and services, the possible
industrial benefits and likely developments in Europe.)
Both the BBC and IBA have produced ‘teletext’ systems, known respectively
as CEEFAX and ORACLE, which allow the broadcasting of written and
simple graphical information to television receivers fitted with special adap¬
tors. Both systems enable viewers to select a display of ‘pages’ of written
information on the television screen; the system also allows sub-titles to appear
in conjunction with programmes, which is of great benefit to the deaf and hard
of hearing. The Post Office’s public viewdata service, Prestel, offers a wide
range of information which is transmitted through telephone lines and may be
viewed on appropriately equipped television receivers (see p 324).
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
EBU manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that network
and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcast¬
ing stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides technical aid,
particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisations through¬
out the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 200 television organisations in over 90 countries and is the most
widely used newsfilm agency in the world. The BBC is also a member of the
TELEVISION AND RADIO
427
International Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality
information programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press Inter¬
national, Paramount Pictures and Independent Television News jointly pro¬
vide an international newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas television
organisations via the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on training in
broadcasting for overseas students and largely finances the British Council (see
p 71), which includes in its activities training in educational television and
radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas. Training in tele¬
vision work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Television
College in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communications Union, the United Nations agency responsible for the regula¬
tion and control of all international telecommunication services (including
radio and television), for the allocation and registration of all radio frequencies
and, through its international consultative committees, for the promotion and
co-ordination of the international study of technical problems in broadcasting.
The BBC is also represented on the United Kingdom Committee of the
International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
24 Sport and Recreation
ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
Sports
Councils
There is widespread interest in sport in Britain. Large crowds attend occasions
such as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the inter¬
national rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms Park,
the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races, Grand Prix
motor racing and the cricket Test Matches; millions also watch them on
television. Many people take part in active recreation such as climbing, rambl¬
ing, riding, boating, angling and other water-based sports, keep fit, movement
and dance activities. Indoor sports like darts, billiards and snooker are also
popular.
An important feature of British sport and recreation is its amateur element
(the people who devote time and energy to the organising, teaching and
training of individual activities).
A Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of the Environ¬
ment is responsible for co-ordinating government policy on sport and active
recreation. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
exercise similar responsibilities in their areas.
The Government provides financial and other assistance through a number
of official bodies. Some of these, such as the Sports Councils (see below) and
the Countryside Commissions, have specific responsibilities for sport and
recreation, and assist other public and private bodies in the provision of
facilities. Others, for example, the Forestry Commission, the British
Waterways Board, the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional water
authorities, provide recreational amenities in addition to their main functions.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and for
general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for Wales and
the Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by the
Government. The Councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government (in 1980-81
amounting to some ^24-7 million). They award grants for sports development,
coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport and other
national organisations; and administer the national sports centres. Grants and
loans are made to voluntary organisations and local authorities to assist the
provision of sports facilities. In some circumstances grants are also given to
commercial organisations. The Councils also assist British representatives at
international sports meetings and encourage links with international and over¬
seas organisations. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and rep¬
resentative bodies of sport and physical recreation in England. There are nine
regional councils for sport and recreation in England, on each of which are
represented the sporting, countryside and local authority interests of the
region. The Scottish Sports Council consults with the Scottish Standing
Conference of Sport which comprises representatives of the national governing
Organisations

bodies of sport in Scotland; and the Sports Council for Wales maintains,
through a standing committee, a close liaison with the governing bodies of
sport in Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Education provides financial assist¬
ance to local authorities and voluntary sports bodies for the provision of
facilities.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland, which is financed by the Depart¬
ment of Education for Northern Ireland, advises the Government on sport and
physical recreation and gives financial assistance to sports organisations for
training and coaching, equipment and administration. In order to reduce the
overlapping of functions between the Council, the Department of Education
and district councils, the Government has proposed that the Council’s role
should become advisory only.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documenta¬
tion Centre, set up by the Sports Council and based at the University of
Birmingham. The Council also has an information centre providing data on a
wide range of sports topics; similar services are provided by the Sports Council
for Wales and the Scottish Sports Council. The Sports Council’s Technical
Unit for Sport gives technical advice on the design and layout of sports halls
and playing areas and carries out research.
Individual sports are run by independent governing bodies whose functions
usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, holding events, handling
membership, selecting and training national teams and promoting inter¬
national links.
There are also organisations which represent people who take part in more
informal physical recreation, such as walking, or cycling for pleasure; others,
for example the National Trusts (see p 188), are concerned with leisure
interests as part of a wider concern.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association’s committee consists
of representatives of the 26 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British team; raises funds;
makes all the arrangements for the team’s travel and comfort at the games;
organises the provision and transport of clothing and equipment; and provides
a headquarters staff for the management of the team.
The National Playing Fields Association aims to encourage the provision of
playing fields, playgrounds and recreational facilities. It maintains a technical
advisory service, and specialises in the play and recreational needs of children
and young people including young handicapped people. The Association is a
national charity established by Royal Charter, and depends mainly on volun¬
tary contributions with some support from public funds. It is helped by its
eight regional play advisers and by affiliated associations in Scotland and
Northern Ireland and in English and Welsh counties.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, aims to
encourage greater opportunities for the physically handicapped to take part in
sport and active recreation. The Association receives an annual Sports Council
grant and provides advice on physical recreation for the disabled, arranges
sports meetings and encourages the provision of facilities (including sports
clubs) for disabled people. Regional and branch committees of the Association

organise local, regional and national games. Annual national and international
paraplegic games are arranged by the British Paraplegic Sports Society. At
Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the first sports stadium in the world designed for
the disabled was opened in 1969. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
there are similar associations which co-ordinate sporting activities and facilities
for disabled people. The Sports Council has been instrumental in forming the
United Kingdom Sports Association for People with Mental Handicap. This
brings together organisations concerned with mentally handicapped people in
order to increase their opportunities to take part in sport.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations. Sponsorship may take the form of financing specific events, or it
may be granted to individual sports organisations.
A Sports Aid Foundation has responsibility for raising and distributing
funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in order to assist the
training of talented individual sportsmen and sportswomen. The Foundation
makes grants on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. In
Northern Ireland this is done by the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust. The
Sports Council also runs a sponsorship advisory service which links potential
sponsors with suitable sports.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation; their total expenditure on sport and outdoor recreation
in England and Wales amounted to some £375 million in 1979-80, and in
Scotland about £76-8 million. The facilities provided include parks, playing
fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, lakes, swimming baths and
sports centres catering for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities.
Publicly maintained schools are required by law to provide for the physical
education of their pupils. All (except those solely for infants) must have a
playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Some have other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement. In many areas, physical education facilities
in schools are available to the whole community outside school hours. Sport
and recreation facilities are likewise provided at universities (some of which
have departments of physical education), and there are ‘centres of sporting
excellence’ at universities and other colleges enabling selected young athletes to
develop their talents and also providing for their educational needs.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation in national parks, nature reserves,
forest parks and country parks are provided by public bodies (see p 180).
Water-based activities on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are increasingly
popular. The British Waterways Board, for example, maintains about 1,760
kilometres (1,100 miles) of cruising waterways for navigation, about 1,450
kilometres (900 miles) of other waterways and some 90 reservoirs. An Inland
Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises the Board on the use of its
waterways for pleasure purposes, and a Water Space Amenity Commission
gives advice on the recreational use of water in England generally.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities, many
facilities are made available by local voluntary clubs. Some of these cater for
indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports grounds,
particularly for games such as cricket, association and rugby football, hockey,
tennis and golf. Clubs linked to industrial business firms often cater for a wide
range of activities, and in many cases make their facilities available to members
of the public. Commercial facilities, provided as profit-making businesses,

include tenpin bowling centres, ice- and roller-skating rinks, squash courts,
golf driving ranges and riding stables.
National sports centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from
voluntary sources, are maintained by the sports councils and provide facilities
and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many recreational
activities. As well as making residential courses available for enthusiasts from
all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local clubs and by the
community generally.
There are seven national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for a range of sports are provided at three centres: the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey in Buckinghamshire and
Lilleshall National Sports Centre in Shropshire. The centre at Crystal Palace
has a main stadium seating 17,000 spectators, a sports hall seating 2,000
spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic requirements and
seating 2,000, two teaching pools, ten squash courts, an indoor cricket school,
practice rooms for most indoor sports and a hostel for 132 residents. These
facilities are available for international competitions as well as for training
purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater London Council in
addition to the Sports Council grant. The other four are specialist centres: the
Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain Activities in north Wales, the
Cowes National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight, the Holme Pierrepont
National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire, and Harrison’s Rocks, a
small rock-climbing centre in Sussex. Work has begun on the construction of a
National Outdoor Pursuits Centre at Plas-y-Deri in Gwynedd which is
expected to be completed in 1982, and there are plans for the construction of a
National Ice Skating Centre in Manchester. In addition there is a National
Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported by local authorities but
financed mainly from the Sports Council for Wales grant.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor sports, Inverclyde at Largs for
general sports, and a national water sports training centre in Cumbrae Isle on
the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres (such as the Meadow-
bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh District Council) cater for a
wide range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local
interest. Over 300 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national needs;
more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are also several
centres catering for specialised interests and generally administered by the
sponsoring organisations. These include the National Equestrian Centre, run
by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke Mandeville Sports
Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by the British Paraplegic
Sports Society (see p 429).
Northern Ireland has 12 indoor sports centres, 11 of which include swim¬
ming pools. Three others, which will also include pools, are being built.
Some of the major sports in Britain are described below. Sportsmen may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, such as rugby union
football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but in others the distinction
between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined.
Probably the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate
432

football associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 400 clubs are affiliated to the English Football Association (FA)
and some 37,000 clubs to regional or district associations.
The principal clubs in England and Wales belong to the Football League (92
clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish Football League (38 clubs); the clubs
play in four divisions in England and Wales and three in Scotland. During the
season attendances at Football League matches total about 25 million.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Football League
Cup, the Scottish FA Cup and the Scottish League Cup are organised
on a knock-out basis, and the finals (four of the most important matches of
the year) are played at Wembley Stadium, London, and at Hampden Park,
Glasgow.
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against one another annually and take part in European
competitions, the World Cup competition and other international matches.
Attempts have been made to give football clubs closer links with the com¬
munity in order to overcome problems of hooliganism. The Sports Council,
using specially allocated funds, has made grants to a number of clubs to enable
them to modernise or expand football and other sporting facilities which will
attract young people.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country run¬
ning, relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and
race walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and,
for women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board which is composed of representatives of
the national associations. For the Olympic Games one team represents the
United Kingdom but England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland com¬
pete separately in the Commonwealth Games and also organise their own
international meetings. The Board also administers coaching schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering (traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional; and in both, strict
medical regulations are observed.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy, club and association boxing, and boxing in the armed

services. There are separate associations in Scotland and Wales. Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association. The associations
organise various amateur boxing competitions, and teams from England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board appoints inspectors, medical officers and rep¬
resentatives to ensure that regulations are observed and to guard against
over-matching and exploitation.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century is the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National Cric¬
ket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams which play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day sponsored
Test Matches played between England and a touring team from Australia,
New Zealand, India, Pakistan or the West Indies. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these countries in the British winter.
One-day international games also attract large crowds. A World Cup is played
every four years, with some of the smaller cricketing nations as well as the
major countries competing. There is also a sponsored First Class County
Championship of three-day games played by 17 county teams who also take
part in three one-day sponsored competitions—two of these are knock-out
competitions and the other is a Sunday League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926. Women’s cricket clubs have
regular week-end fixtures, and junior sides play largely six-a-side com¬
petitions. Test match series are played against Australia, New Zealand and the
West Indies and other international games take place.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of all field sports
(including hunting, game shooting, falconry and hare coursing). The Society
is a member of the British Shooting Sports Council which is the representative
body of recreational shooting.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most popular British
hunting sport but there is also stag hunting, and hunting the hare. The fox
hunting season lasts from early November to April; there are over 320 packs of
hounds of all kinds in Britain. The sport is not without its critics, but a large
number of people take a keen interest in it.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, black-grouse,
partridge, pheasant and ptarmigan, species which are protected by law during
a close season when they are allowed to breed on numerous estates supervised
by game-keepers who are employed on private property as well as by bodies
such as the Forestry Commission. It is necessary to have a licence to kill game,

and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by anyone who owns,
buys or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conservancy, formed by landowners,
farmers and others interested in game conservation, collects information and
studies factors controlling game population.
The most popular country sport is fishing, and there are about 4 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers and
lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised form of
fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and
bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers and many
clubs organise angling competitions. National championships are organised by
the Federation which also enters a team in the World Angling Championship.
Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse fishing is let to
angling clubs by private owners, while trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week or
month. Coastal and deep sea fishing are free to all (apart from salmon and sea
trout fishing which is by licence only). In Northern Ireland the Ulster Provin¬
cial Council of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, the Ulster Coarse Angling
Federation and the Ulster Angling Federation look after the interests
of the sport. In Wales all angling is the responsibility of the Welsh Anglers
Council.
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The Club is the inter¬
national governing body of the sport. Golf is played throughout Britain and
there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns, some of them owned by
local authorities. The main event of the golfing year is the Open Golf Cham¬
pionship; other important events include the Walker Cup match for amateurs
and the Ryder Cup match for professionals, both of which are played between
Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight, widely regarded as the most important tennis
event in the world; this draws large crowds, with the grounds at the All-
England Club accommodating over 30,000 spectators. There are also county
championships and national competitions for boys’ and girls’ schools. Inter¬
national events include the Davis Cup and Kings Cup for men and the
Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United States
compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports are motor racing and motor rallying.
The governing body, RAC (Royal Automobile Club) Motor Sports Associa¬
tion, issues competition licences to motor clubs registered with it covering all
events from hill climbs to full international race meetings. It also organises the
British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula One World Motor
Racing Championship, and the RAC Rally which counts towards the World
Rally Championship.
Motor cycle racing is governed by the Auto-Cycle Union and the most
important events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, the
British Grand Prix, and the TT Formula 1 World Championship. Motorcycle
speedway racing is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
SPORT AND RECREATION
435
Racing
Riding
Rugby
Football
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early
November) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The
Derby, run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand
Guineas, both run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St. Leger,
run at Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is
the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham. The Grand National, run
at Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known steeplechase.
The Jockey Club administers all horse racing in Britain. Its rules are the
basis of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses. Racing takes place on
most weekdays throughout the year and about 12,400 horses are in training.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (considered to be among
Britain’s most popular spectator sports) takes place at 105 tracks licensed by
local authorities. Meetings are usually held two or three times a week at each
track, up to a maximum of 130 days a year. Rules for the sport are drawn up by
the National Greyhound Racing Club; overall administration and organisation
is the responsibility of the British Greyhound Racing Board.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) at
international level is the British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the
work of the British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association.
At national level the British Horse Society promotes the welfare of horses
and ponies, the interests of horse and pony breeding and the art of riding. It
provides information, publications, a film library, courses and examinations
and, together with riding schools approved by it, helps to promote horse-
mastership. It also runs the British Equestrian Centre at Kenilworth, War¬
wickshire, where activities take place throughout the year. With some 30,000
members the Society is the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club
movement. These hold rallies, meetings and competitions, culminating in
their annual national championships at the British Equestrian Centre.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of the
Society. The three-day events held each year are at Badminton (Avon) in
April, Windsor (Berkshire) in May, Bramham (Yorkshire) in June, Burghley
House (Lincolnshire) in September, and Wylye (Wiltshire) in October, and
include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association which
draws up competition rules and prescribes the general standards and height of
obstacles. The Association keeps a register of horses and ponies taking part in
shows and seeks to improve the standard of jumping and to provide for British
representation in international competitions. It has over 16,000 members and
1,250 shows are affiliated to it. The major show jumping events each year
include the Royal International Horse Show, the Horse of the Year Show, and
the Birmingham International Show Jumping Championships.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
(a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while Rugby League (a 13-a-side
game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (in England), the Welsh Rugby Union, the Scottish Rugby
Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. International matches between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year and there
are tours by international teams.
Rugby League is played mostly in the north of England. The governing
BRITAIN 1981: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
body of the professional game is the Rugby Football League which sends
touring teams to Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played
against France. The Challenge Cup Final, the major match of the season, is
played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is governed by the
British Amateur Rugby League Association. An international championship is
played annually between England, Scotland and Wales (competing as one
team), Ireland and France.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,450 affiliated clubs, 65,000 personal
members and approximately 600 recognised teaching centres in the country,
including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight where
courses are available in all branches of the sport. One of the world’s principal
regattas takes place each year at Cowes, and major events are held at other
British sailing centres.
Swimming Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn to
swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching is
provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The Associa¬
tion also draws up and enforces regulations for amateur swimming, diving,
synchronised swimming and water polo championships and competitions in
England. Separate associations control the sport in Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.
Underwater swimming (sub-aqua) is governed nationally by the British
Sub-Aqua Club which promotes underwater exploration, science and sport.
Formed in 1953, the club has become the largest in the world with some 30,000
members and more than 1,000 branches in Britain and overseas.
Other Sports The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations linked to a
national body. Many of the sports have separate national bodies for England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted under strict
regulations and the total money staked in Great Britain in 1979 was about
£5,100 million. It is estimated that some 94 per cent of adults gamble at some
time or another, 39 per cent regularly.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and card games, gaming machines
and licensed bingo, thought to be played by about 5 to 6 million people on a
fairly regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse and greyhound racing,
and on football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 12,000 licensed
off-course betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked. A
form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the
Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB contribute a
‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy Board which promotes the
improvement of horseracing and horsebreeding and the advancement of vet¬
erinary science.
In addition legislation allows local authorities and certain bodies to hold
lotteries.

Annual reports are published by the Sports Council, the Scottish Sports Council, the Sports Council
for Wales and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. In addition, most of the organisations
concerned with sport publish year-books covering results and records of the previous season and
future prospects. Many weekly or monthly periodicals on sport are also published.
Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is,
Accidents, Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of).
In cases where the first word is not separable, however (for example, Royal
Air Force, Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales
only where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are
indexed under the relevant subject headings.
