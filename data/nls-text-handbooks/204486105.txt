Introduction
Britain 1977 is the twenty-eighth official handbook in the
series prepared and revised each year by Reference Division
of the Central Office of Information. The contents are based on
information available up to September 1976. The handbook
is widely known as an established work of reference and is
the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by the British
Information Services in many countries. It is available overseas
in a limited free edition and is on sale by Her Majesty's
Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1977 is primarily concerned to describe the machi¬
nery of government and other institutions, together with the
necessary physical and social background,, and to show the
part played by government in the life of the country. It does
not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
The factual and statistical information it contains is com¬
piled with the co-operation of other government departments
and agencies, and of many unofficial organisations. While
most sections relate to Britain, facts and figures for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are given separately
when relevant.
Sources of more detailed and more topical information
(including statistics) are mentioned in the text and in the
Bibliography towards the end of the book.

THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands
lying off the north-west coast of Europe. The largest islands are Great Britain
(comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (com¬
prising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of
England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these have
administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea
and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large
measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales,
Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Discrepancies between totals and their constituent parts are due to rounding.
When studying British statistics it should be noted whether they refer to
England, to England and Wales (considered together for many administrative
and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England, Wales and
Scotland, or to the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) as
a whole. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the
Isle of Man, 227 square miles (588 sq km), and the Channel Islands, 75 square
miles (194 sq km), which are dependencies of the Crown, but not part of the
United Kingdom.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°

passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly 45; Eas^ an<^ westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 600 miles (966 km) in a
straight line from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and
about 300 miles (483 km) across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous
bays and inlets no place is as much as 75 miles (121 km) from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually
less than 50 fathoms (300 feet or 91 metres)—because the islands lie on the
continental shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor
plunges abruptly from 600 feet (183 metres) to 3>000 feet (9J4 metres). These
shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing grounds
as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic current, the drift
of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to erosion and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, lowland Britain and highland Britain.
In lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
(305 metres) above sea level. Its boundaries run roughly from the mouth of
the Tyne in the north-east to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth—Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet (305 metres). This high
ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old
rocks (archaean and palaeozoic), while the upper strata in the valleys and plains
are mainly more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern
and western parts of lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which were the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found
on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of
the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age
during which, at one period or another, ice caps and ice sheets extended
approximately as far south as the Bristol Channel and the Thames valley. The
ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet (1,342 metres); in Wales,
Snowdon, 3,560 feet (1,085 metres); and in\England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumbria), 3,210 feet (978 metres). '

of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had
previously been formed, so that, when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills
stood out as barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris—
boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the
lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous drainage channels and left
large lakes, which have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt
and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same
types as the highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher parts the moor¬
land vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, parti¬
cularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of highland Britain often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales;
the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the coast of Cumbria; and the vertically
jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even
around lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft,
white limestone—the chalk—forms white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline
have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the
Humber and the Thames estuary is low-lying mostly, and for centuries some
stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of
the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the
short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the prevail¬
ing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled
mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a
generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British
Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic,
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry,
continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days
or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and
the depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the
north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the

spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British Isles, stronger
on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The
strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick,
Shetland Islands, varies from about 19 mph (31 km/h) in January to about
14 mph (23 km/h) in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western
outskirts of London, the average speed varies from about 10 mph (16 km/h)
in January to about 7 mph (11 km/h) in August. The stormiest region is along
the north-west coast with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west of Britain the mean annual temperature ranges from
8°C (47°F) in the Hebrides to ii°C (52°F) in the extreme south-west of
England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly
temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 4 C
(39°F) during the winter (December, January and February) to i2°C (54°F)
during the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the
Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (4i°F) and i6°C (61 F). The
average range of temperature between winter and summer varies from 7 C to
I2°C (450-54°F), being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 2^°C
(8i°F) in the south, but temperatures of 32°C (90°F) and above are infrequent.
(During late June and early July 1976, however, some parts of the country
experienced their longest periods of temperatures around 32°C since records
were first taken.) Extreme minimum temperatures depend largely on local
conditions, but —7°C (20°F) may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, — i2°C
(io°F) is rare, and —i8°C (o°F) or below has been recorded only during
exceptionally cold periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches (1,016
mm), while England alone has about 34 inches (854 mm). The geographical
distribution of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure
to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more
rain than the lowlands of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches (3,810
and 5,080 mm) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during
the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches (508 mm). Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on the average, March to June are the driest months and October to
January the wettest. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is excep¬
tional, and is usually confined to limited areas. For many places, however,
the summer of 1976 saw the driest period of weather since records were first
taken.
The distribution of sunshine over Britain shows a general decrease from south
to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During
May, June and July—the months of longest daylight the mean daily duration
of sunshine varies from five hours in north-west Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.

In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe in recent years as a
result of changes in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer;
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole
of lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation
the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moor¬
land. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the surface
of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east
of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border.
Yet much of Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and
elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch. The number of elm trees, especially in
southern England, has been severely reduced since the late 1960s by ‘Dutch’
elm disease.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which over a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi¬
natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The removal of hedges to facilitate mechanical
farming has resulted in a more open landscape in certain parts of the country.
The cool temperate climate of Britain and the even distribution of rainfall
ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grassland is green through¬
out the year with many wild flowers from spring to autumn; in most years
there is scarcely a month in which some flowers may not be found in hedgerows
and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, includ¬
ing the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct; but red
deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on
Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland
6
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which are
probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild in
some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are foxes
in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and streams. Both
common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast, though not
usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles,
shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey much more numerous
than the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravels pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found; salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
introductions for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, 89 kinds, including salmon, have been recorded, com¬
pared with only one in 1964.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. T he amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to
4 inches or 8 to 10 cm) and the stag beetle (2! inches or 6 cm). The insect
fauna in Britain is less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a
number of common European species. With modern methods of pest control,
extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases
spread by insects are not common in Britain but there is some anxiety that
chemical protection against insects may be reducing the population of creatures
which feed on them, and of their predators in turn. These and other effects
of agricultural chemicals on wild life are the subject of special safeguards.

THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are-descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
their language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Corn¬
wall, the Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary estimate
put the population of England and Wales at 5 J million and that of Scotland
at about 1 million. The main factor in this gradual growth of population was a
slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in Britain, as in all
countries before the development of medical science, by high death rates and,
in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from
the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigra¬
tion from Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, mar¬
riages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and
reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital
statistics (that is, statistical informatidn based on statutory registration of
births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic censuses of population.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are some 500 superinten¬
dent registrars in charge of registration districts and nearly 1,150 registrars in
charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed
either by the councils of counties or of metropolitan districts and in London
by the borough councils. They act under the instruction of the Registrar
General for England and Wales, who is also director of a central government
department, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose functions
include regulating the registration of births, deaths and marriages, the
planning and carrying out of population censuses, and the compilation and
analysis of population and vital statistics. There are corresponding authorities
and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
Since 1801 censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly
every ten years, except that because of war there was no census in 1941. The
latest full census in Britain was in April 1971.
In mid-1975 the estimated home population of Britain (excluding the popula¬
tions of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) was 55,962,000 compared

with 54,218,000 in mid-1965, 38-2 million in 1901, and 10-5 million (in Great
Britain) in 1801. The main causes of this great increase in numbers were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into
the beginning of the twentieth century.
Britain’s population density was approximately 594 persons per square
mile (229 per sq km) in mid-1975, but in England there were approximately
923 persons per square mile (356 Per scl km), and in Greater London 11,664
persons per square mile (4,502 per sq km).
Since 1971 there has been a decline in the rate of population growth. However,
on the basis of mid-1975 population estimates and of present trends in birth
and death rates and migration, the increase in population is expected to con¬
tinue, reaching 56-9 million in 1985, 59 million in 1995, 60-4 million in 2005
and 62-5 million in 2015. This represents an average growth rate of 0-2 per
cent a year over the whole period.
Growing public concern about the effects of an increasing population on an
already densely populated island led to proposals for a policy on population
matters. In 1971 the Government set up a Population Panel following recom¬
mendations made by a House of Commons Select Committee. In its report
the panel endorsed the main recommendations of the select committee
for an official attitude on population and for comprehensive family planning
services as an integral part of the National Health Service. Provisions for
family planning advice and help within the framework of the National Health
Service have gradually been extended so that a free service is now available
to all (see p. 133). In 1974 the Government announced that it proposed to
give higher priority to survey and research work to study fertility, mortality
and migration, in an attempt to discover more about the factors which have
caused the recent decline in the rate of growth of population in the United
Kingdom. The Lord Privy Seal has been given ministerial responsibility for
monitoring and co-ordinating further developments in population matters.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was over 30 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 20 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. But when death rates in all
age groups fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and
1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain
the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population. By the 1930s the birth rate had fallen to
less than half the nineteenth century rate. The population continued to increase
slowly, but its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1901 and 52 years for a girl, to 69 years at
birth for a boy born in 1972-74 and 75 for a girl.
The continuous fall in the number of births and birth rates ceased in 1933
and for the rest of the 1930s remained at about 15 per 1,000 population. During
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
9

Causes

and Divorce
the second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary
post-war peak of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It receded to slightly
above the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but from 1956 onwards began to rise
again, reaching a peak of 18-8 per thousand in i964..It has since fallen particu¬
larly sharply, reaching 12-4 per 1,000 population in 1975. The proportion of
illegitimate births, which reached a peak of 9'i per cent of all live births in 1945,
the end of the second world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached
4-5 per cent; since then it has risen, and was about 8-5 per cent in 1975.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and mortality
from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the mid¬
nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year
old per thousand live births) has fallen from 142 in 1900-2 to 16-8 in 1974 and
maternal mortality from^-yi per thousand live births in 1900-2 to 0*19 in 1974.
The reported mortality from some of the illnesses of middle and old age, such
as cancer of the lung and heart diseases, has risen during the twentieth century,
and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in diagnosis, is at least
partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective measures to combat some
of these illnesses and improvement in positive health does not always bring
increased immunity or resistance to them. Death rates from suicide have shown
a marked decline within the past decade (from 107 per million in England and
Wales in 1965 to 75 in 1975).
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women pre¬
ponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
There are more than 105 females to every 100 males in Britain. Formerly
women outnumbered men in every age group from adolescence onwards.
Recently, however, the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the
influence of these factors on the sex ratio so that the age at which women begin
to outnumber men has advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly—there are more than 18 women over 70 years old to every 10 men—
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are or have been married has risen from about 52 per cent in 1939 to 62-4 per cent
in 1974, while the proportion of single persons in the population aged 15 years
or over has fallen from 33-3 per cent to 227 per cent. This change has been due
mainly to an increase in marriage rates among men and women in their late
teens and early twenties; whereas in 1939 only 33’8 per cent of young women
aged 20 to 24 were or had been married, in 1974 the percentage was 58.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There were nine decrees of divorce made absolute in 1975 ^or everY I)000
married people in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of divorced
people marry again.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part of the
twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family (that is,
the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread of
deliberate family limitation. Couples married just over a hundred years ago
produced on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline
seems to have set in with those married in the 1860s, and the average family size
for Great Britain fell to less than 2-1 for those married in the decade 1934-43.
There has since been some increase, and the average family size of women
marrying in the 1950s is about 2-3 liveborn children, although recently married
women have delayed child bearing.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20 and
30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to replace
the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present century
had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for replacement.
Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to exceed full
replacement with the generation born during the second world war. The rise
has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women getting married and
of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the nine¬
teenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to adults of
working age. This ratio was at a minimum in i93°- After 1936 the number of
children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in the birth rate
after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era of high fertility
and representing successive generations of steeply rising numbers, increased
very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also increasing relatively faster
than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth rates after 1942 arrested the
compensating fall in the number of children and further reduced the proportion
of people of conventional working age.
Because of this high proportion of the young and the old in the present
population, which is expected to increase still further, and the growing numbers
of young people continuing in full-time education, there is a special need to
make the best use of national human resources, both by ensuring that those
available for work are able to find suitable employment and by increasing the
rate of technological improvement and of training and retraining in order to
raise productivity. At the time of the 1971 census 91 per cent of men and 55 per
cent of women between 15 and normal retirement age (65 for men, 60 for
women) in Great Britain were economically active in remunerative work (this
includes those temporarily out of work or sick). In addition some 19 per cent
of men and over 12 per cent of women over normal retirement age were still
economically active. At the other end of the scale, some 30 per cent of young
people between 15 and 20 were continuing their education (in 1971, 15 was
school-leaving age; it was raised to 16 in 1972).
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the i93os t^ie balance of
migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 193° weM over 20 million
people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the Common¬
wealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and large numbers
of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians, entered
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
II
Nationality
Britain. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from Britain’s present area
amounted to some 4 million between 1871 and 1931. Since then the balance
of migration for Britain as a whole was inward until 1967, since when a small net
outflow has been recorded. The population of Scotland and Northern Ireland
has been characterised by a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales.
There have been two main periods of net inflow into Britain since 1931. The
first was in the years 1931 to 1940 when emigration was very low, many former
emigrants returned, there was considerable net immigration from the Irish
Republic, and extensive immigration from Europe, including about a quarter
of a million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, from the 1950s,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth coun¬
tries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan. In the three years
1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about three-
quarters of them from the Commonwealth. It was in these circumstances that
the Government introduced the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which
gave it power to restrict the number of people from the Commonwealth and, in
principle, the Irish Republic who did not have citizenship of the United King¬
dom and Colonies and who might immigrate into Britain without assured
prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support. The Common¬
wealth Immigrants Act 1968 extended immigration control to citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies who had no close links with Britain: broadly
speaking, those neither born, naturalised, adopted or registered in Britain nor
having a parent or grandparent who was. The Immigration Act 1971, which
replaced this earlier legislation, provides a single system of control over
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals entering Britain. It confers a right
of abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth, adoption, naturalisation or
registration or are children or grandchildren of such persons, on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who have been resident in
Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on Commonwealth citizens
with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those having this right of abode
are known as ‘patrials’. In general, others wishing to enter Britain for employ¬
ment must hold work permits. Exceptions are Commonwealth citizens with a
grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-free categories, and nationals of
European Community countries. The dependants of work permit holders and
of those who may enter without work permits may also be admitted.
The net emigration from the United Kingdom to Commonwealth countries
in 1975 was 7,300 and to foreign countries 34,500, including 5,400 to other
countries in the European Community. Some 19,350 work permit holders and
4,510 dependants entered Britain from overseas countries in addition 1082,400
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals accepted for settlement. Over
the same period residence permits were granted to 8,125 nationals of European
Community countries. (For welfare of immigrants see Chapter 6.)
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, persons born in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the United
Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant exceptions,
citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizenship may also be
acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen otherwise than by
descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a father who is a citizen
by descent only; by registration, for citizens of Commonwealth member
countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children and for women married

to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in consequence of an adoption
order; and, for aliens, by naturalisation. The requirements for naturalisation
include five years’ residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies, good character,
a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside in the United
Kingdom or a colony. The requirements for registration are similar except
that most Commonwealth and Irish citizens settled in Britain by 1st January
1973 have the right to be registered after completing five years’ ordinary
residence without satisfying any other requirement. Some 64,600 people
acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration in 1975.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizenship
by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another country
(although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he derives it
becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United King¬
dom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign national.
Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except
in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation
or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is,
however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the
nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in Umted
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
A government review of United Kingdom nationality law is in progress.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 21 per cent of the population aged three years and
over (some 542,400 people) at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh Language
Council, an official body, promotes the use of the language. 1 he \\ elsh Language
Act 1967 affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English in the administration
of justice and conduct of government business throughout Wales. The number
of bilingual schools is increasing. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in I971’
mainly in the Highlands and western coastal regions, were able to speak the
Scottish form of Gaelic. A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the
Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer
effectively living languages, although there is a revival of cultural interest in
Cornish, and, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used in addition to English for certain
official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. In Jersey French is the official
and ceremonial language, although English is also used in the courts, in
Guernsey English is used in almost all official proceedings.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that of all
other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by country, as
enumerated by censuses in 1901, 1931, 1961, and 1971 (or nearest possible
estimate) and estimated in i975> is shown in Table 2, which also gives figures
for the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
The standard regions of England, which are sub-divisions of the country
used for most statistical and economic planning purposes, have the following
populations (provisional mid-1975 estimates): East Anglia 1,780,400; East

Yorkshire and Humberside 4,894,400.
Geography, history and economic factors have given rise to the differences
between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and to an uneven
distribution of the population within them.

Table 3 gives figures of some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half
the British population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire
and West Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having
the industrialised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations
are: the central lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the
river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the
English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated
areas are the eastern fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames
estuary, and the far south-west. Most of the mountainous parts of Britain,
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the central
Pennines in northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. Though in most places the population has been increasing, there
have been local differences in the rate of increase. Many places in the Midlands,

1975 (Scotland) and October 1973 (Northern Ireland).
prosperous parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have had increases
well above the average national rate, while remote country areas in northern
England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have had relatively
small increases. The differences result largely from the effect of migration
towards areas of expanding employment and housing opportunities and towards
certain retirement areas.
Urban Dispersal Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE 15
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the large
conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During the
twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have
continued to spread and merge. Over one-third of the population lives in
Greater London, the metropolitan counties, and the Scottish conurbation of
Central Clydeside (centred on the city of Glasgow). The centres of the metro¬
politan counties are the cities of Manchester (Greater Manchester), Liverpool
(Merseyside), Sheffield (South Yorkshire), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and
Wear), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), and Leeds and
Bradford (West Yorkshire).
There has been a recent decline in the numbers of people living in inner urban
areas, balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and beyond the
outer suburban fringes (limited in certain areas by the ‘green belt’ policy where
little development is permitted). This applies most strikingly to London, also
to the outer areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside counties and to
such towns and' cities as Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Norwich, Oxford, Ports¬
mouth and Sheffield.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership and the growth of motorway and trunk road networks, expansion
in public transport serving journeys to work, private property developments
to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers of population to the
new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands and Merseyside and
to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work, housing
or study purposes is shown by the finding that 10-9 per cent of residents in
Great Britain in 1971 had changed their address in the preceding year and 32-5
per cent in the previous five years; 4-3 per cent had moved between England and
Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another, during 1966-71.
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
This section gives some points of general interest about household structure and
social characteristics in Britain as a background to the information given in later
chapters of the handbook, in particular those on housing, transport, employ¬
ment, planning and the environment, and sport and recreation. It deals with
topics in very broad and informal terms and many exceptions apply to the
generalisations. Some of the sources consulted are listed in the Bibliography.
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly throughout
the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes include
two major wars, a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, earlier marriage,
widening educational opportunities and technical progress, particularly in
communications and transport. The following account applies primarily to
Great Britain. Many of the same factors are at work in Northern Ireland but
their effect is modified by both the Province’s history and the emergency
of recent years.
The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in families
or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people in the
armed services and in educational or other institutions. Most people marry in

and
Environment

their twenties (women in their early twenties and men in their middle twenties),
some 90 per cent being married by the time they are 30. There were approxi¬
mately 27-5 million married people at the time of the 1971 population census
and of these about 25 million were estimated to be married couples living to¬
gether in some 12-5 million separate families containing some 46 million people,
the remainder living either on their own or with other persons or families,
except for a small number living in institutions. Of the 12-5 million families,
nearly 8 million, comprising 32 million people, contained a married couple
and their children or grandchildren. There were, in addition, 1-2 million
families consisting of one parent living with children or grandchildren. About
half, mostly women, were bringing up between them about 1 million dependent
children; the rest were living with adult children or grandchildren.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from over
four persons in 1911 to 3• 1 in 1961 and 2-8 in 1973. It is estimated that in 1973
19 per cent of households consisted of one person only, 32 per cent of two,
18 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four and 13 per cent of five or more. However,
about half of the small households (one or two persons) contained a person over
60 years old while the other half consisted largely of young, often recently
married, couples without children and of young people who had left home to
live on their own during the first years of their employment and increasingly
during the last stages of their education. Relatively few people in their middle
years lived in small families without children.
Houses are much more common than flats; four British households out of five
live in a house. In the centre and inner areas of large towns and the inner
streets of small towns and villages, terraced houses, most of them built in the
early years of the present century, still provide accommodation for a third of
all households. In urban areas, slum clearance and redevelopment have been
major features of post-1945 public housing policies. Although in the 1960s
high-rise blocks of flats were thought to offer a number of advantages, such
as economy in land use and speed of construction, their disadvantages from
certain points of view, including inhumanity of scale, have led to the current
preference for carefully planned low-rise, high density layouts, including
many houses with gardens or patios. With the help of improvement grants
from public funds, the modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing
has increasingly been encouraged as an alternative to clearing and rebuilding,
as a way of preserving the social fabric and of making more economic use of
resources, including the skills of small building firms.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has been
suburban. More than half Britain’s families now live in houses grouped in small
terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with gardens,
and providing two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from two to four
bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories. From 1919 to 1939 such
houses were often located along main roads, a pattern which became known as
‘ribbon development’. More recently the pattern has tended to change to one
of housing in estates set back from the main thoroughfares with more attention
given to amenities such as health centres and community centres which provide
for various activities, often run by associations of the residents. Standards of
new housing have improved considerably in recent years and many more houses
now have modern conveniences. In 1973 some 89 per cent of households in
Great Britain had exclusive use of a bath or shower, and 95 per cent had sole use
of a lavatory—high percentages by international standards. Most housing
built nowadays is centrally heated. At the same time improved housing

design and greater use of labour-saving equipment and materials have com¬
bined to lighten the burden of housework. Some nine households in ten
have a vacuum cleaner, more than two in three a washing machine, over four
out of five a refrigerator, one in three an electric food mixer and nearly all an
electric iron. An increasing, but still comparatively small, number have a
dish-washing machine, deep freeze and tumble drier. Very few households
employ any regular paid help and hardly any have a resident servant. Some
households get help through the local authority home help service because
of particular need, for example, if there is an invalid or elderly person in the
house or because the mother is having her baby at home. People in full-time
work benefit from launderettes with extended opening hours and from the fact
that some shops stay open later, at least one evening a week.
Over half of all families now own their own homes, though half of these home
owners still have further repayments of mortgages to make. Most of the other
households rent an unfurnished house or flat either from a local authority
(an increasing trend) or from a private landlord (a falling trend). People in
unskilled manual jobs are more likely to live in rented accommodation,
particularly local authority housing, than people in non-manual occupations.
Though many people, perhaps 20 per cent of all heads of households, seem to
stay nearly all their lives in the house into which they moved on marriage, there
are always a number of individuals and whole families (perhaps between 6
and 9 per cent of families each year) changing their homes for a variety of
reasons. Much of this movement is to another house in the same or neighbouring
area, but there are certain broad patterns of movement, for example, the drift
away from very remote rural areas and from the centres of large towns towards
suburbs and rural areas accessible to towns, and the movement of people on
retirement to the country and seaside.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership. New housing estates are often some distance from
public transport and from work places, schools and the main shops.
Some 55 per cent of households now own cars (70 per cent in country areas).
In the mid-1950s public transport was more significant than private motoring,
but now private motoring, measured in terms of distance travelled by passengers,
is nearly four times as important as public transport. The volume of public
transport services has not fallen as much as the use of them; indeed, many
inter-city rail services have become more frequent over the last ten years.
In urban areas, in spite of heavy falls in use, bus services have been broadly
maintained. Services in rural areas, however, have been sharply reduced.
Very great benefits are conferred on families and individuals by the growth of
car ownership, but this trend has serious implications for the public transport
system. The problems of those without access to a car, many of whom are among
the poorer sections of the community or are elderly or infirm, are being given
particular attention in the development of transport policies.
The spread of car ownership has also influenced large-scale urban recon¬
struction and road development programmes of the last 20 years. Some towns
and cities have been altered to accommodate more traffic and house more
people; many town centres have pedestrian precincts; by-passes help to reduce
traffic in city centres.
In modern industrial society in a densely populated country there is much
scope for conflict between the need for communal facilities and the desire to
preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential
users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need to
accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies,
The Economic
and Social
Pattern
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
such as the National Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural England,
are being supplemented to a growing extent by those of groups formed expressly
to safeguard the amenities of a particular area and to give publicity to the views
of the people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment which can be caused by the disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the
appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on Environ¬
mental Pollution, a Clean Air Council and an Advisory Council on Noise.
Voluntary societies include the National Society for Clean Air, the Noise
Abatement Society and the Council for Nature.
The working population comprises nearly half the total population. About
35 per cent of employees work in manufacturing industries and slightly more
(36 per cent) in professional and government (including local government)
services, 12 per cent in the distributive trades, 8 per cent in public utilities,
6 per cent in the construction industry and less than 3 per cent in agriculture.
For a long period an increase in real earnings was a principal factor in British
working and social life. Between 1950 and 1974 real personal disposable
income1 more than doubled to £41,150 million, an average annual rise of 4-6 per
cent. It is estimated to have fallen by between a half and one per cent in I975>
the first year to show a fall since the official series was started in 1948.
Although the progressive effect of direct taxation on the degree of inequality
of income distribution is largely offset by the regressive effect of indirect
taxation, the combined effect of the tax system, the receipt of transfer pay¬
ments and direct and indirect benefits in kind is a major redistributive one.
The Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth, in a report
published in 1975, showed that, on the basis of the latest available figures,
changes in the distribution of income between the late 1950s and 1972-73
were not very pronounced, but there had been a continuing decline in the
share of the top 5 per cent of income recipients from about 20 per cent of
income before tax in 1959 to 17 per cent in 1972-73, accounted for largely by
the drop in the share of the top 1 per cent from about 8 per cent to 6 per cent
over the same period. (The fall in the share of the top 1 per cent since i93^_39
had been about two-thirds.) The share of the bottom 20 per cent had increased
between 1959 and 1972-73 from 5-3 to 5-8 per cent.
There is very little knowledge about long-term trends in the distribution
of wealth, but such estimates as there are show a substantial fall in the
share owned by the richest people in the community. The Royal Commission
found that in 1972 about 28 per cent of personal wealth was owned by the
top 1 per cent of the adult population, and over 82 per cent by the top 20 per
cent. The value of state pension rights has a marked effect on these figures;
in particular the share of the top 1 per cent falls by a third while the share
of the bottom 80 per cent of the adult population is more than doubled.
The proportion of personal wealth held in the form of physical assets rose
from less than a third in i960 to a half in 1973, reflecting especially the in¬
creasing importance of dwellings. There has been a marked decline in the
relative importance of company securities in the composition of personal
wealth.
The pattern of expenditure has been changing. Expenditure on food now
1 Total personal income less taxes on income, national insurance contributions, transfers
abroad (net) and taxes paid abroad.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!9
accounts for a smaller share of total consumer expenditure than it did ten years
ago. Increases have taken place, however, in expenditure on motor vehicles,
housing, alcoholic drink, recreation and entertainment. The proportion of
expenditure on clothing and footwear has fallen.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use of
convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods in the 1960s, has been
partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. The general picture
of British food consumption between 1972 and 1975 shows a drop in con¬
sumption of meat, eggs, oils and fats, sugar, fruit and vegetables, and increases
in dairy products, potatoes and grain products. Tea remains the most popular
drink but many more people are drinking coffee than before (mainly ‘instant’
coffee). A greater willingness to try unfamiliar foods has given rise to a wider
availability of imported products, as well as to restaurants serving the national
dishes of other countries.
Over the period 1964-74 total consumption of beer (Britain’s most popular
alcoholic drink) rose by 30 per cent; that of spirits by 77 per cent; and that of
wine 123 per cent. Indications are that in 1975 consumption of spirits and wine
fell slightly, although beer consumption increased.
Many of the differences between socio-economic groupings have been
reduced during the twentieth century, but persist in such matters as educational
attainment, standards of health and even mortality rates. Differences between
the counties and regions of Britain have also been identified, notably the con¬
centration of higher employment incomes in London and south-east England.
Big town houses have been converted into flats, offices or nursing homes,
while some country estates have been opened to the public or have become
schools, rehabilitation or recreation centres or wild-life parks. The proportion
of the working population in non-manual occupations is growing and an
increasing number of people in professional or managerial occupations are the
children of manual workers.
A broadly similar way of life is shared by many members of the immigrant
communities who have settled ?n Britain since the 1950s, though, as new arrivals,
mainly from Commonwealth countries, sometimes with a poor command of the
English language or none at all, they may face problems of limited employment
opportunities and inadequate housing. Evidence of immigrant cultures can be
seen in the urban areas where most of them have settled (national dress worn by
many Asian women, Asian films and shops, market stalls with West Indian
fruit and vegetables) and many schools have adapted their curricula to
allow host and immigrant communities to understand each other’s traditions
better. The needs of immigrant children for language training are being met in
special centres run by the education authorities, of workers, increasingly, in
colleges of further education and in the factories themselves, and of Asian
women in groups run by local community relations councils and other voluntary
organisations.
The greatest social changes have been in the lives of women. During the
twentieth century there has been a notable shortening of the proportion of a
woman’s life devoted to the care of children. A woman marrying at the end of
the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and
would be likely to have seven or eight children of whom four or five survived
to the age of five. By the time the youngest was 15 she would have been in her
early fifties and would expect to live a further 20 years, during which custom,
opportunity and health made it unusual for her to do paid work. Today women
marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman’s youngest child will
be 15 when she is 45, and she can expect to live another 35 years and is likely to

take paid work until retirement at 60. Even while she has the care of children,
her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods. This
significant change in women’s life pattern has only recently begun to have its
full effect on their economic position. Up to about 20 years ago some 85 per
cent of girls left school at the minimum age of 15 and most of them took a
full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and
often never returned to it. Thus, single women, nearly half of them under 25,
formed some 56 per cent of the female labour force. Today the school-leaving
age is 16, many girls stay at school after that age, and, though women tend to
marry younger, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before
their first child is born. Very many more subsequently return to full- or part-
time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the
husband accepting a greater share of the burdens and satisfactions of family life,
and with both partners sharing more equally in financing and running the home
according to their respective capacities and interests. However, in spite of these
major social changes and the removal of practically all sex discrimination in
political and legal rights, the Government believes that tradition and prejudice
still handicap women in their working careers and personal lives. Accordingly,
major legislation promoting equal opportunities for women and equal pay has
recently been brought into force.
Social attitudes have continued to change over the past 20 or 30 years and there
has developed, for example, a more informed tolerance of certain types of
deviant behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise individuals with particular
problems. This spirit of toleration is reflected in the growing popular sympathy
for the difficulties of the unmarried mother, for instance, and in the passing
of more liberal laws on such matters as abortion, divorce and homosexuality.
Similarly, changes in the law applying to young offenders reflect the view that
it is unreasonable to treat children who have broken the law as fundamentally
different from children in trouble of other kinds.
This liberalising trend is balanced by a recognition that, in some areas,
restrictions on certain freedoms must be extended in the interests of society as a
whole—hence legislation on race relations and the control of dangerous drugs
and firearms. There are also fears in some quarters that liberal attitudes towards
social problems have failed to produce adequate solutions and that a more
disciplined approach is necessary.
Relationships between the generations are undergoing considerable change,
with the result that there is today a greater readiness on the part of children and
young people to criticise traditional institutions and to seek more influence in
shaping society. This desire for personal involvement is manifest not only
among those prepared to demonstrate for or against certain courses of action
and to bring pressure on the responsible authorities, but also among the
increasing numbers of young people who offer their services to help the old, the
disabled, the illiterate, and others in need.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of full¬
time work are usually from 39 to 40 hours a wreek, although many manual
workers actually work somewhat longer (about 45 on average) because of
voluntary overtime work, while the hours worked by women and girls average
somewhat less. Most employees work a five-day week.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year in
addition to public holidays and in practically every case the minimum period
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
is three weeks. Britain has fewer public holidays than nearly all other European
countries.
The number of holidays taken in Great Britain by British residents was 40
million in 1975 compared with 31 million in 1966. More than two holidays in
five in Great Britain are spent at the home of a friend or relative, and over a
quarter involve camping or caravanning. Holidays abroad in 1975 numbered
8 million, compared with 5-5 million in 1966. A major factor in this growth
has been the availability of reasonably priced ‘package’ holidays. Spain, by
far the most popular destination, receives a third of all British holiday-makers
abroad.
Apart from holidays, leisure patterns for the individual are determined very
much by age, sex, social class, income, access to a car and education. The
General Household Survey of 1973 (published in 1976) found that the per¬
centages of people interviewed who had taken part in a variety of leisure
activities at least once in the four weeks before the survey were roughly as
follows: watching television and listening to the radio or records, 95 percent;
hobbies 49 per cent; going out for a drink (the public house—known as the pub
or the local—is a traditional social centre for many people), 38 per cent;
gardening (a majority of British families have some garden or an allotment
despite the high proportion of the population living in urban areas), 30 per cent;
eating out, 29 per cent; open-air outings, perhaps to parks, seaside or country¬
side, 21 per cent; cultural outings, 18 per cent; outdoor sports and games, 18
per cent; going to social clubs,1 12 per cent; film-going, 11 per cent; watching
sports and games, 10 per cent; taking part in indoor sports and games, 10 per
cent; visits to buildings and museums, 9 per cent; social and voluntary work,
7 per cent; and attending leisure classes, 2 per cent. These statistics are quoted
in Social Trends ig75.
Television watching, easily the most popular leisure activity, takes up over
19 hours a week on average for people aged 5 years and over. Boys and girls aged
5 to 14 tend to watch rather more. About 95 per cent of British households have
a television.
1 These include clubs run by political groups; trade unions; church groups; social,
cultural and academic groups; youth clubs and organisations; and groups of local
business and professional people. The longer-established clubs organised on a national
basis include the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and
the Women’s Institutes.

system as membership of the United Kingdom Parliament, but with smaller
constituencies. There would be a block grant to the assemblies which would
take into account local needs and the desirability of some uniformity of stand¬
ards in all parts of the United Kingdom. Allocation of the grant among different
devolved services would be a matter for the assemblies.
The establishment of the assemblies would not, however, detract in any
way from the overriding interest of all British people in the determination of
United Kingdom policies as a whole. The United Kingdom Parliament and
central government ministers would remain fully responsible for overall
British interests; Scotland and Wales would retain their present representation
in Parliament; and Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would continue
to act as full members of the Government forming United Kingdom policies.
Ministerial responsibility for devolution policy is held by the Lord President
of the Council, a senior member of the Cabinet. He is assisted by other
ministers, and works in collaboration with the Secretaries of State for Scotland
and Wales. At official level a Cabinet Office unit works closely with the Scottish
and Welsh Offices, and reports to the Lord President.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to it and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown.
The United Kingdom Government is responsible for their defence, their
international relations and, ultimately, their good government. They have
separate arrangements with the European Community which take into account
their special relationship with the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which have never been codified and are not directly enforceable in a court of
law, but which, nevertheless, have a binding force as rules of the constitution.
Because the constitution is not contained in any single document, because it
can be altered by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by general agreement to
vary, abolish or create a convention, it can the more readily be adapted to
changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are readily distinguishable although their
functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, the supreme authority in the realm (see p. 27);
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Government—that is the Cabinet
and other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and
directing national policy (see p. 40); (b) government departments, most of
them under the control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are
responsible for administration at the national level (see p. 43); local authori¬
ties, which administer and manage many services at the local level (see
p. 64); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible for the
operation of particular nationalised industries or of a social or cultural
service, for example, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.

Succession,
Accession and
Coronation
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years, and, in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the
United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is Sovereign, her representative is the Governor-General, who is
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and
is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United
Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by Governors who
are appointed by the Crown, having various executive and legislative powers,
and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good govern¬
ment of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the
Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England) are alone
eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its
present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common consent of the
member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of succes¬
sion to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the daughters
succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and
effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king
takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does not apply
and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he fills an important
role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the
accession of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the
new Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and 1 emporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and
the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval of
possibly a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in
substance for over a thousand years although the details have frequently been
modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The corona¬
tion service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of representatives
of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
GOVERNMENT
Acts of
Government
25
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
governor of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule.
The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the
name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred
years towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity
for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen. These include the summoning,
prorogation and dissolution of Parliament; giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by both Houses of Parliament; making appointments to all important
State offices, including those of government ministers, judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats and all the leading positions in the
established Church of England; conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
honours1, and remitting all or part of the penalty imposed on a person con¬
victed of a crime. An important function is the appointment of the Prime
Minister. This is normally automatic, and the Queen must invite the leader of
the political party commanding a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. If, however, no party has a majority, or if the majority party
has no recognised leader, the Queen must select a Prime Minister, and can
consult anyone she wishes. In international affairs, the Queen as Head of
otate has the power to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign
States and governments, to conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowa¬
days exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliament
and can be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not require
Parliament s prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but Parlia¬
ment has the power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not,
however, detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation in the
smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable State papers; she must be informed and consulted on every
aspect of the national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is totally
incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne). The
regent w ould be the Prince of Wales, and thereafter those in succession to the
throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State
(the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in succession to the
Crown, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may delegate certain
royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve Parliament
(except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or create peers.
‘Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime
Mimster’ a few are confeired on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the
Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order

GOVERNMENT
27
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and,
Royal Visits in spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain. Royal marriages
and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The birthday of the
Sovereign is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on
the Horse Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the
United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal
processions add significance to such occasions as the opening of Parliament,
when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace. The Queen and
other members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom
every year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic,
industrial and charitable works of national importance encourages nation¬
wide interest and publicity. For 1977, which marks the Silver Jubilee of the
Queen’s accession to the throne in i952> special commemorative arrangements
are being planned throughout the country. The Queen pays State visits to
foreign governments, always accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, and
undertakes lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other
members of the royal family pay official and private visits overseas.
Royal Income More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
and Expenditure the royal family is borne on the votes of public departments—including, for
example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train and
the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen’s public expenditure
on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out official duties as head of State
is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament and met partly from
the Consolidated Fund and partly by the Treasury; her private expenditure
as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly from the
revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster; and her personal expenditure as a private
individual from her own personal resources. Annual allowances approved by
Parliament are specifically made to certain other members of the royal family.
No allowances are made to the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, who
as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the estate of the Duchy
of Cornwall (he has voluntarily agreed to surrender half the revenue to the
nation). The Queen meets from her Privy Purse the official expenses of
members of the royal family for whom Parliament has not specifically provided.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they work in different places; and they meet
together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the coronation, or
the State opening of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by the
Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however,
Parliament is a corporate body and cannot as a rule legislate without the
concurrence of all its parts.
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination
of them. It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,
28
The Functions
of Parliament
The Meeting of
Parliament
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, and have
subordinate legislatures1 which legislate on island affairs.
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the
legislatures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is
virtually free to legislate as it pleases: generally to make or unmake any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what, was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong
its own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way.
Its members bear in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain
throughout the centuries and act as far as possible in accordance with precedent
and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that
has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper
authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely
to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of
party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises
various types of Community legislation, including regulations, which take
direct effect in member countries, and directives, which are binding as to the
result achieved upon each member State to which they are addressed, but
allow the national parliaments to choose the form and method of implementa¬
tion. The national parliaments of the nine Community members currently
delegate a number of their members to sit in the European Assembly. It
is hoped that the first direct elections to the Assembly will be held in
1978. A more detailed account of Britain’s membership of the European
Community is given in Chapter 3.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to scrutinise government policy and administration,
particularly proposals for expenditure and taxation. In discharging these two
functions Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the
electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of
all important international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties
being, in theory at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and not subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament (in the sense of a parliamentary period) has a maximum duration
of five years, but may be, and nearly always is, dissolved, and a general election
held, before the end of this term. The maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation passed in the usual way in such rare circumstances as during the
two world wars. Dissolution is ordered by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister, by means of a royal proclamation which, besides dissolving
the existing Parliament, orders the issue of writs for an election, and announces
the date on which the new Parliament is to meet (not less than 20 days after
the dissolution). The proclamation is very soon followed by the issue of writs
in each constituency to cause an election to be held on the day named.
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of
Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member
of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative
measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
GOVERNMENT
29
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October and interspersed with
‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and the spring
holiday and during a long summer recess starting latein July or early in August.
The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about 160 in the House of
Commons and about 140 in the House of Lords. At the start of each session the
Queen’s speech in the House of Lords outlines to the members of both Houses
the Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative programme. Each
session is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act which appoints the
day of meeting in a new session (on rare occasions Parliament has been
dissolved without prorogation), and a short speech is made on behalf of the
Queen summarising Parliament’s work during the past session. Parliament
then ‘stands prorogued’ until the new session opens. Whereas an adjournment
does not affect uncompleted business, the effect of a prorogation is at once to
terminate nearly all parliamentary business, so that all public Bills not com¬
pleted in the session lapse, and must be reintroduced in the next unless they
are to be abandoned.
The House of The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
Lords The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Tem¬
poral may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of England,
Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who have not disclaimed
their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life peers and peeresses
created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3) those Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed to assist the House in the perfor¬
mance of its judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their
retirement. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to sit in the House of
Lords (subject to certain statutory disqualifications), provided the holder is
21 years of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12
months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Dis-
claimants lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they gain the right
to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to the
House of Commons. No hereditary peerage has been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that House. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence
for the duration of a Parliament.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily attendance
is about 270) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in
public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but they
are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to the Houses of Parlia¬
ment and within specified limits they may claim payments for expenses
incurred in attending the House (except for judicial sittings).
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of the
Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed by
the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a
deputy speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the
Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all commit¬
tees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent officers include the
Clerk of the Parliaments, who is responsible for the records of proceedings
3°

including judgments and for the promulgation of Acts of Parliament, the
other Clerks at the Table; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is also
Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor; and the Yeoman
Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons (516 for
England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Sovereign. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a result
of the death or resignation1 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the
House of Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary
and an allowance for secretarial and research expenses. They also have a
number of other allowances, including travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial members, subsistence allowances. The
basic salary for members is ^6,062; this comprises the 1975-76 salary of ^5,750
plus a 1976 j£6-a-week increase permitted under the Government’s pay policy
for 1975-76 (see p. 194). The £6 increase was not paid, or was reduced, where
it would have carried earnings from parliamentary and other sources over the
£8,500 limit for pay rises.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and two deputy chairmen who
act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the nomina¬
tion of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other
than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members o
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is the
accounting officer for the House of Commons Estimates, and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the orders of the blouse, is the
official housekeeper of the building, and is responsible for its security.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure
equitable representation, four permanent Boundary Commissions (for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) make periodic reviews of
constituencies and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem
necessary in the light of population movements or for some other reason.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which
British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens of the
Irish Republic are entitled to vote provided that they are 18 years old or over,
and are not subject to any legal incapacity to vote. People eligible to vote in
any constituency are those who are annually recorded on a register of electors
for the constituency as resident in that constituency on a date fixed by statute.
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a polling station, although
members of the armed forces, Crown servants of the United Kingdom and
staff of the British Council employed overseas, and wives or husbands of such

cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and Stewar

of the House but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches.

persons, if resident overseas with their married partners, may vote by proxy.
Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter
cannot attend in person because of blindness or other physical incapacity or
the nature of his work or on grounds of religious observance. British subjects
who are on the electoral register and who are temporarily abroad on business
may vote by proxy if they cannot return in time for polling day; those who are
away on holiday cannot vote.
Voting is not compulsory, but of about 40 million people entitled to vote
in the elections of February and October 1974 some 787 per cent and 72-8 per
cent respectively cast their votes. The candidate who polls the most votes in
any constituency is elected; an absolute majority (a greater number of votes
than those cast for all other candidates combined) is not required.
Anyone, man or woman, who is entitled to vote and who has reached the
age of 21 can stand for election. Undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the
Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of Ireland and Roman
Catholic Church, and certain people holding offices of profit under the Crown
are, however, not eligible. The last category is defined in the House of Com¬
mons Disqualification Act 1975 and includes holders of judicial office, civil
servants and some local government officers, members of the regular armed
forces, members of the police forces and members of public corporations and
government commissions. A candidate usually belongs to one of the main
national political parties, although smaller parties or groupings also nominate
candidates, and individuals may be nominated without party support.
The maximum sum of money that a candidate may spend on his election
campaign is £1,075, plus £0'o6 for each eight electors in a borough constituency
and £0-06 for each six electors in a county constituency. A candidate may
send by post (free of postal charge) an election address to each elector in his
constituency. All other expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal expenses,
must be covered by the statutory sums.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect. The percentages of votes cast for the main
political parties in the October 1974 general election and the resulting distribu¬
tion of seats in the House of Commons are given in Table 4.
I he party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of \otes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by
the Sovereign; and its most outstanding members in the House of Lords and
the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments on the advice of the
Prime Minister. I he largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’;

“ By-elections and other developments have since changed party strengths.
no party succeeds in winning an overall majority of seats in the House of
Commons; then a minority government or a coalition might be formed.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament largely rests on the
relationship between the Government and the Opposition. Depending on
the relative voting strengths of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition might seek to overthrow the Government by securing a sufficiently
large adverse vote on a major policy issue. In general, however, its aims are
(a) to contribute to the formulation of policy and its expression in legislation
by constructive criticism of the Government’s approach; (b) to oppose specific
government proposals that it considers objectionable; (c) to secure concessions
on government Bills; and (d) to increase support outside Parliament and
enhance its chances of success in by-elections or at the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, by the Govern¬
ment Chief 'Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The
Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the
House of Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for
debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of
the House is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is
his duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying up wards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Com¬
mons is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government
GOVERNMENT

Parliamentary
Procedure
Whips, three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal
Household, five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
and seven are paid Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief
Opposition Whip and his counterpart in the House of Lords, and to two of
the Assistant Whips for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The
Government Whips in the House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household
and sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the last general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: £500 for every seat
and .£1 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £150,000. The Government is
considering whether public funds should be made available to political parties
for their work outside Parliament, and to candidates for election expenses.
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on custom and precedent, supple¬
mented by standing orders governing details of practice in each House.1 The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; and members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main
difference is that in the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general
sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority
to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House.
He must guard against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority
rights, and he has a discretion whether to allow or disallow any closure motion
(that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote).
He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save the time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder
he can adjourn the House or suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast for and against the motion under debate, the Speaker must
give the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which pre¬
clude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the
House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but
no casting, vote—the House of Lords being generally governed by the principle
that unless there is a majority in favour the question is decided in the negative.
When the House is sitting judicially (see pp. 85 and 99) the question is put
in such a wray that, if the votes are equal, there is no interference with the
judgment under appeal.
The House of Commons has a public register of members’ pecuniary
interests. Members with a direct pecuniary interest in a matter before the
House must abstain from voting in connection with it, though in order to
operate as a disqualification the interest must be immediate and personal, and
not merely of a general or remote character. In any proceedings of the House
or in transactions with other members or with ministers or civil servants,
members must disclose any relevant pecuniary interest or benefit.

Legislative
Proceedings
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547, together
with the parliamentary and political papers of certain past members of the
Houses, are available to the public in the House of Lords Record Office.
Parliamentary proceedings are not transmitted on television, but both Houses
of Parliament are to have permanent radio broadcasting of their proceedings.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles
are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new circumstances, but
substantial changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government
through the normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public
Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private
Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or by a ‘private
member’ of either House of Parliament who does not hold office in the Govern¬
ment. Most public legislation is in fact drafted on behalf of ministers, and has
the support of the Cabinet before being presented to Parliament by the
appropriate minister.
In the modern legislative process, before a Government Bill is finally
drafted, there is normally considerable consultation with, for instance,
professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other agencies interested in
the subject matter of the proposals, such as major interest groups and ‘pressure’
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative
changes are sometimes set out by the Government in ‘White Papers’ which
may be debated in Parliament before the introduction of a Bill. From time to
time ‘Green Papers’ are published setting out for public discussion major
ministerial proposals which are still at the formative stage.
Public Bills can first be introduced in either House. As a rule, however,
Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before the
Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass through
the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose must be introduced in
the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation or the spending of public money
must be based on resolutions agreed to by the House, often after debate, before
it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a public charge, it
can only be introduced by a minister, which gives the Government considerable
control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot
for the chance to introduce a Bill during time specially allocated for private
members’ Bills; the first 20 are successful. A private member may also present
a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill under
the ‘ten minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one
against the measure, after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill
to be brought in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a
few become law. If one secures a second reading, the Government usually
introduces any necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be
introduced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the time
that can be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and after
GOVERNMENT
Delegated
Legislation
35
a while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the
Bill) it is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles and
merits. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee to recommend whether it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually referred for
detailed examination to a standing committee (see p. 36). If the House so
decides, the Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in committee.
In the Lords a Bill is considered by a committee of the whole House as a matter
of course, unless the House decides to refer it to a Public Bill Committee.
The committee stage is followed by the report stage, during which previous
amendments may be altered and new amendments incorporated. At the third
reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken
without a debate unless there is a motion in the name of six members that the
question ‘be not put forthwith’—a procedure of which substantial use is made.
After the third reading the Bill is sent from the Commons to the Lords
where it goes through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts in
the Lords and is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the
stages there. Amendments made by the second House must be agreed by the
first, or a compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through
the Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons it would
not become law because no debating time would be allotted to it—at least until
a new Government came into office. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot in
general prevent a Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming
law. In the normal course of events they either accept a Commons Bill without
changes, or they amend and return it for consideration by members of the
other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made. In practice, the
Lords pass without amendment such financial Bills as the Finance Bill, which
authorises taxation, or the Consolidated Fund or Appropriation Bill, which
authorises national expenditure. A Bill that deals only with taxation or expendi¬
ture must become law within one month of being sent to the Lords, whether
or not they have agreed to it, unless the Commons directs to the contrary.
The Lords can delay a non-financial Commons Bill for about 13 months.
The limitations on the power of the Lords are based on the belief that the
principal legislative function of the non-elected House nowadays is to act as
a chamber of revision, complementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known
as an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard. Both
parties may be legally represented.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to govern-

meat ministers, government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval
by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in
the exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right
to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations which will be affected thereby before rules
and orders (in the form of statutory instruments) are made.
A joint committee of both Houses checks the technical propriety of statutory
instruments, and a standing committee of the House of Commons considers
their merits.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a committee of
the whole house, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their second
reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the Chairman of
Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords) or a
deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on. Each has between
16 and 50 members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far as possible
that in the House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises
all 71 Scottish members and ten to 15 others, considers the principles of
Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and
other matters relating exclusively to Scotlancj. The Welsh Grand Committee,
with all 36 Welsh members and up to five others, considers the annual report
for Wales and other subjects concerning Welsh affairs. The Northern Ireland
committee considers matters relating specifically to the province. An experi¬
mental standing committee has been set up to consider English regional affairs.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration
and reporting to the House. They may be appointed as occasion demands or,
as ‘sessional’ select committees, at the beginning of a session. On rare occasions
a parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure additional
to the legislative process). Select committees are constituted on a party basis,
in proportion to party strength in the House.
Sessional select committees in the Commons include committees on public
accounts, expenditure, privileges, services, nationalised industries, the Parlia¬
mentary Commissioner for Administration and European Community
secondary legislation. The Committee of Selection and the Standing Orders
Committee have duties relating to private Bills, and the Committee of Selection
also chooses members to serve on standing committees. ‘Specialist’ select
committees not necessarily appointed regularly include those on science and
technology, race relations and immigration, and overseas development.
In their scrutiny of administrative activity and government policies, the
committees question ministers, senior civil servants and interested bodies and
individuals. They bring before Parliament and the public generally, through

their hearings and published reports, a body of fact and informed opinion on
many important issues and they build up considerable expertise in their
subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords there are sessional committees on the European
Community, standing orders (Private Bills), personal Bills, procedure,
offices, privileges, leave of absence, and Lords’ expenses, selection and the
Appeal and Appellate Committees.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint com¬
mittees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
important party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists of
the back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party,
is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when
the Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communi¬
cation between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of a Parliamentary Committee.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either by
passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of govern¬
ment policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back-benchers
are provided in parliamentary procedure. These include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation, answer
questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible. Parlia¬
mentary questions are one means of eliciting information about the
Government’s intentions, as well as a way of airing, and possibly securing
redress of, grievances brought to members’ notice by constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and the summer) a day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave for it to be put
forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members
support the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter
is debated for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays
time for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate (scrutiny by small
committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure proposals).

Parliamentary

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time, and during debates on the Government’s legisla¬
tive proposals.
Certain opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided in
the House of Lords at question time and during debates on specific motions.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 17, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in Parliament to keep members informed
about European Community developments, and to enable them to scrutinise
and debate matters which are to be decided in Community institutions.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is an independent
statutory officer whose function is to investigate complaints of maladministra¬
tion brought to his notice by members of the House of Commons on behalf of
members of the public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken by
central government departments in the exercise of their administrative func¬
tions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government
and can be questioned in Parliament). Certain administrative actions also
outside his jurisdiction include matters affecting relations with other countries
and the activities of British officials outside the United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit.
A select committee considers these reports.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims from the Crown their ancient
and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament.
These include freedom of speech in debate; freedom from arrest; and the
right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House.
Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right
to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a
seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a
breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate,
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created

government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the
Sovereign to approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorpora¬
tion; and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of
delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not
thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders
are based; this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of
the order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as sum¬
moning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are independent
of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision over
the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in
some branch of public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. There are
usually about 340 Privy Counsellors. The whole Privy Council is called
together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
I here are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These advisory committees may be prerogative committees, such
as those which deal with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of
the Channel Islands and Isle of Man and with applications for charters of
incorporation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal
from the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue the
appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other
courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church sources.
1 he administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in
the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister. He is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary
Secretary, and has special responsibility for devolution policy (see p. 22) and
other work relating to the development of political institutions.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Alinister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. How¬
ever, the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of
Lords as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify
Committees of

Council

its actions to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
Composition
Prime Minister
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but
the abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Ministers may be classified as follows:
The Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority
enjoyed by the holder of this office derives from his ability to command a
majority in Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers
to the Queen and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the Commons
on the most important topics and general administration.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord-Lieutenants and certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some
university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime
Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well
as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (awarded to people who have achieved eminence in
science and the arts and who are in some financial need) and selects the
trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
A specialist unit advises the Prime Minister on domestic policy matters.
Departmental Departmental ministers are in charge of government departments. The
Ministers holders of these offices, who are usually in the Cabinet, are known as ‘Secretary
of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and a
number of sub-departments).
Non-Departmental Non-departmental ministers include the holders of various traditional offices
Ministers the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,1
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to time Ministers
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and

without Portfolio. Sometimes these ministers have few or no departmental
duties and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime
Minister may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State are usually appointed in a subordinate capacity to govern¬
ment departments in which the work is particularly heavy or complex and
where it involves frequent travelling abroad. It is possible for a Minister of
State to be given a place in the Cabinet and to be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or, where
the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under Secretary of
State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve their senior
ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary debates,
answering parliamentary questions, and assisting in departmental duties. In
certain cases, however, they may be given responsibility, directly under the
head of the department, for specific aspects of the department’s work. The
Parliamentary Secretary to the I reasury and the other Lords Commissioners
of the Treasury are in a different category as Government Whips (see p. 32).
Ministerial salaries range from £5,812 a year for junior ministers and £7,812
to L%500 f°r more senior ministers to £13,000 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £20,000 a year.
Ministers in the House of Commons, including the Prime Minister, also
have parliamentary salaries of £3,000 (£3,7°° f°r non-Cabinet ministers) and
are entitled to claim the allowances paid to all members of the House. The
Lord Chancellor receives £20,000 a year, including £2,500 for his speakership
of the House of Lords.
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally selected by the
Prime Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-
departmental offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences
that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the Privy
Council, during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal
from an active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development
of organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the
franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in
accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica-

tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office) and a resigning minister wishing to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned.
The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or
reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action. Ministers not
in the Cabinet may attend its meetings for discussion of matters affecting
their departments; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for government policy and actions and ministers’ individual
responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses to
resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter of
general policy or on a single major issue.
The individual responsibility of a minister fpr the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administra¬
tion, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since the
majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are available
to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented
in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a
Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee.
Any decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way that
there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.
GOVERNMENT
43
Internal
Organisation
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under various degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied by some
organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence)
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (for example, the
Department of Employment) cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the Department of Education and Science
and the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with affairs in
England. There are separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland,
and there is also a separate department with responsibility for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is
responsible for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, and the Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury
ministers are responsible for the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland
Revenue, the Department for National Savings and a number of small depart¬
ments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and
the National Debt Office. Generally, departments receive their funds directly
out of money provided by Parliament and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging its
duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many departments
also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, economists, statisticians and
their own information divisions. The Government Statistical Service, which
includes the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office
(BSO), the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divi¬
sions of the major departments, provides a service of statistical information
and advice. Each department compiles statistics relating to its own policy
area and publishing them, usually through its own publications. Information
about individual industries is published by the BSO in Business Monitors.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Advisory Bodies Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
44
Distribution of
Functions
The Cabinet
Office
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect information,
mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming to a
decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned
because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and repre¬
sentatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists,
trade unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and
local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions
examine w7ritten and oral evidence from government departments and in¬
terested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit recom¬
mendations. The Government may accept the recommendations in whole or
in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries
may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by the head
of the appropriate department.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the mam
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which,
in view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further
information on the work of departments is given in later chapters under the
relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Policy
Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of
Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the pro¬
gress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major
issues of policy.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and inter¬
pretation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies
and management. It is directly responsible for the central economic aggregates
such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial statistics and
measures of output; it co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments
and agencies; and it prepares a number of statistical publications.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peace-time events.

The Civil Service Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service, with responsibility for the day-to-day work of
the department delegated to a senior minister. The department’s Permanent
Secretary is also the official head of the Home Civil Service.
The department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Ser¬
vice, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training
(including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management,
catering, welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for the size and deploy¬
ment of manpower, for pay, pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil
Service, and for the co-ordination of pay and pension policies in the public
sector as a whole. The department’s further responsibilities include the
development and application of new systems and techniques in the field of
management and administration; the provision of a central management ser¬
vices consultancy for the Civil Service as a whole to deal with management
subjects and techniques such as organisation and methods and operational
research; and central planning, procurement and co-ordination of data pro¬
cessing in government.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In matters con¬
cerned with recruitment policy, the commissioners are responsible to ministers
in the normal way, but in the selection of individuals for appointment, they
act under Order in Council and are completely independent of ministers.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved
by the Government during the passage of Bills; advises departments on
questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees)
of both Houses as required. In addition the Parliamentary Counsel draft
subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and advise the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within their
special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Financial
Secretary and a Minister of State. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Its Public Services Sector
is responsible for controlling aggregate public expenditure and for most of
the individual public expenditure programmes; the Domestic Economy
Sector is concerned with fiscal, monetary and counter-inflation policies, and
with the Treasury’s contribution to industrial policies, including control of
public expenditure on industry and agriculture; the Overseas Finance Sector
is responsible for balance of payments policies, the management of Britain’s
foreign currency reserves, international monetary questions, financial relations
with other countries and the aid programme; and the Chief Economic Adviser’s
Sector is responsible for the preparation of short-term and medium-term
economic forecasts and for specialist advice on broad economic policies.

food and drink industries and also acts as agent of the Department of Prices
and Consumer Protection for the detailed administration of subsidies on food.
A number of the functions relating to agriculture and fisheries in Wales are
the joint responsibility of the minister and the Secretary of State for Wales. In
regard to the operational control of certain diseases of animals the ministry’s
responsibilities extend to Scotland.
The ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of inter¬
national organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, such as
the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, and the Organi¬
sation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Intervention

schools and other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of
teachers, and the basic standards of education. The department works in co¬
operation with local education authorities whose duty it is to provide and run
the schools and colleges in their areas. Its relations with the universities are
conducted through the University Grants Committee. Activities concerning
civil science are discharged through five research councils: the Medical
Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environ¬
ment Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and the Science
Research Council. On questions of scientific policy an advisory board for the
research councils advises the Secretary of State.
The Department of Employment is generally responsible for Britain’s man¬
power policy and deals with the payment of unemployment benefit, the
collection and publication of statistics on labour and industrial matters,
relations with the International Labour Office, and representation on employ¬
ment and related matters at sessions of other international bodies. The

paid for goods and services; access to special fixed interest rates for export
finance; support for ‘buyer credits’ (loans made direct to overseas buyers
for capital goods contracts enabling the supplier to be paid on cash terms);
insurance against the political risks of new overseas investment for up to 15
years; partial protection for large capital (goods contracts against an
unexpectedly high rise in costs; and support for the issue of performance
bonds for large contracts. The use of the department’s services is optional.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides, mainly through diplomatic
missions, the means of communication between the British Government and
other governments and international governmental organisations for the dis¬
cussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling
within the field of international relations. In particular the department is
responsible for alerting the British Government to the implications of develop¬
ments overseas; for protecting British interests overseas, including commercial
interests; for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining British
policies to, and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with, govern¬
ments and peoples overseas. The department is also responsible for the dis¬

Energy, and Prices and Consumer Protection.
The Secretary of State for Industry is assisted by two Ministers of State
and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Central Office of Information is a common service department which
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments which are responsible for the
policy expressed in its work. In the United Kingdom, it conducts government,
press, television and poster advertising, produces booklets, leaflets, films,
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material, and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and
television material, books, graphics, magazines, reference services, films,
exhibitions, photographs, display and reading-room material; and manages
schemes for promoting the overseas sale of British periodicals and newspapers.
It provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultural exhibitions); and
it organises tours (other than those sponsored by the British Council and the
British Overseas Trade Board) for visitors officially invited to Britain. There
are nine regional information offices in England, which provide services for
the home departments and assist the overseas services by the provision of
material and by arranging tours for overseas visitors; similar services are
supplied on a mutually agreed basis by the information staffs of the Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital transfer tax, petroleum
revenue tax, and the proposed development land tax and certain other direct
taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of land and buildings for
such purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase, and, in England and
Wales, local rates.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales—the Attorney
General and the Solicitor General—appear on behalf of the Crown in important
civil and criminal proceedings and in proceedings before international tribunals
such as the international court at The Hague and the European Commission
and Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The Attorney General is the senior
legal adviser to the Government. He has the ultimate responsibility for the
enforcement of the criminal law and his consent is necessary before proceedings
for a number of criminal offences can be commenced; the Director of Public
Prosecutions is subject to his superintendence. Legal proceedings for the en¬
forcement of public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted
in his name and the functions of the Queen’s Proctor, who has certain duties
connected with the operation of the divorce laws, are exercised under his

direction. The Attorney General is also spokesman for the Lord Chancellor
in the House of Commons on matters affecting the administration of justice.
The Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney General,
with the same rights and duties. The Law Officers, who are leading barristers
and are always members of the House of Commons, are assisted, particularly
in parliamentary work, by a Parliamentary Secretary. Their office has a small
professional staff.
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the judiciary or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor may sit judicially as a member of the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.
He is also the minister primarily responsible for the administration of the
courts and of the law. The Home Secretary has important responsibilities in
respect of the criminal law but the Lord Chancellor appoints magistrates and
recommends to the Crown most other appointments to the judiciary in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. His responsibility for the courts and for their
administrative staff is exercised through six regional (or circuit) offices and
their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court procedure and for law reform,
including appointing the members of the Law Commission, and for presenting
the commission’s reports to Parliament.
In addition he appoints the chairmen of certain administrative tribunals in
England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for Scotland) the members
of the Council on Tribunals; and he is responsible for the administration of
the Judge Advocate General’s Department,1 the Department of the Official
Solicitor2 and the Public Record Office (which preserves, and provides access
to, the national archives).
The Ordnance Survey is responsible for the surveying and mapping of Great
Britain. This includes geodetic surveys and associated scientific work, topo¬
graphic surveys and the production of maps at appropriate scales from these
surveys. The department also undertakes a considerable amount of agency
work for other departments, particularly the Ministry of Defence, and for the
Institute of Geological Sciences and the Land Registry. Parliamentary
responsibility for the Ordnance Survey is exercised by ministers of the Depart¬
ment of the Environment.
Subject to the overall responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, overseas development functions are the responsibility
of a Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who is assisted
by a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
The separate Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for Britain’s
policy of financial and technical assistance to developing countries. It is con-

and the Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military
law, and reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial.
2 The Officuu Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a
mental disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not
be represented. In addition he protects the interests of people committed to prison for
contempt of court, acts as Receiver for people with a mental disability, and can be
appointed as Judicial Trustee in complex and disputed trusts.

cerned with the aid programme as a whole and its detailed composition. The
provision of financial assistance includes both grants and loans (the latter
mostly interest-free since 1965); technical assistance comprises the supply of
British experts and equipment, the training of overseas personnel, and the
support of research and advisory services.
The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General s Office. I he department is also
responsible for the regular payment of many public service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose director is also the
Registrar General for England and Wales, is concerned with the regulation of
civil marriages, the registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and
Wales, and control of the registration services. Its work also includes the
preparation and publication of reports on vital, medical and demographic
statistics, taking the periodical census of the population, and, through the
Social Survey Division, conducting research into the attitudes and circum¬
stances of individuals through direct contact with members of the general
public on a sample basis, or of particular groups.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection is responsible for
general policy and legislation on prices. It also deals with consumer affairs,
and sets policy for consumer credit, fair trading, monopolies, mergers and
restrictive practices, consumer and home safety, and weights and measures,
including metrication, quality assurance and standards. It is responsible for
the Price Commission, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Con¬
sumer Protection Advisory Committee, the Metrication Board, the British
Hallmarking Council, the Hearing Aid Council and the Nationalised Industry
Consumer Councils. It is the sponsoring department for the British Standards
Institution and for the National Consumer Council. The Secretary of State
for Prices and Consumer Protection also appoints the Director General of
Fair Trading. The Secretary of State is assisted by a Minister of State and a
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of his department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers residuary estates (estates undisposed of by will) of certain
deceased persons, and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dis¬
solved companies. The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled
by the Treasury Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute
Law Committee (a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the
judiciary and legal profession in Great Britain).

Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer who has
certain duties in connection with the divorce laws).
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the central purchasing organisa¬
tion responsible for supplying the home and overseas public service with paper,
printing, binding, books, periodicals, office supplies, and office machinery.
The department also provides services such as duplicating, addressing, photo¬
copying, micro-copying, distribution and repair of office machinery.
As publisher for Parliament and the Government, HMSO produces a wide
range of printed matter in its eight printing works and through private printers
under contract. It operates six binding works, two of which are involved in the
repair of manuscripts from national archives. Official publications are sold by
government bookshops in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol,
Cardiff and Birmingham, and through agents in Britain and overseas. HMSO
is also the United Kingdom agent for European Community publications, and
for those of the principal international organisations. The Controller is
Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament, and the copyright of all British Govern¬
ment documents is vested in him.
The Department of Trade is responsible, under a Secretary of State, for
commercial policy and relations with overseas countries. It promotes British
commercial interests overseas, negotiates trade and commercial matters, and
administers British protective tariffs. It sponsors the work of the British
Overseas Trade Board in export services and promotions, overseas finance and
planning. It is responsible for companies legislation, supervision of the insur¬
ance industry, the insolvency service and for patent, trade mark and copyright
matters. Other responsibilities include civil aviation, marine and shipping
policy, tourism, the hotel and travel industries, the newspaper, printing,
publishing and film industries, and the distributive and service trades. The
Secretary of State is assisted by two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State.
The Department of Transport is responsible for roads, transport policy, ports,
railways, freight movement, road and vehicle safety, and urban transport.
The Secretary of State for Transport is assisted by a Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State for Wales, a Cabinet minister, has full responsibility
in Wales for ministerial functions relating to child care, health, housing, local
government, primary and secondary education, town and country planning,
new towns, water and sewerage, roads, forestry, tourism, national parks and
historic buildings, and shared responsibility for the administration of urban
grants to areas of acute social deprivation, and (with the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and food) for agriculture in Wales. He has direct ministerial
responsibility in Wales for selective financial assistance to industry, as well as
a general responsibility for economic development. This aspect of the Secretary
54
BRITAIN I977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of State’s work has been strengthened by the establishment of a Welsh Develop¬
ment Agency, responsible to him, with important industrial and environ¬
mental functions. The Secretary of State has certain responsibilities relating
to the national library and the national museum. He is assisted by two Parlia¬
mentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Welsh Office maintains close and continuous working relationships
with the government departments mainly concerned with economic and
industrial affairs through the Welsh Planning Board. Advice on the implica¬
tions for Wales of national policies, particularly in the economic field, is also
available to the Secretary of State through the Welsh Council. The Welsh
Office is in Cardiff; there is also a small ministerial office in London.
SCOTLAND Scotland has its own system of law and a wide measure of administrative
autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister, has responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the
formulation of policy and for its execution in such matters as agriculture and
fisheries, education, local government and environmental services, social
work, health, housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road trans¬
port services. He is also responsible for a range of other functions from police
and fire services to sport and tourism. At ministerial level he is assisted by two
Ministers of State and three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The United Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
based in Edinburgh and known collectively as the Scottish Office. A manage¬
ment group including five heads of departments under the chairmanship of
the Permanent Under Secretary of State advises the Secretary of State,
particularly on questions, such as the allocation of resources and forward
planning, with which more than one of the departments are concerned.
The Secretary of State also has a major and expanding role in the planning
and development of the Scottish economy. He has important additional
functions related to industrial development, with the establishment of the
Scottish Development Agency which is responsible to him, and his assumption
of responsibility for selective financial assistance to industry in Scotland.
He plays a full part in the Government’s determination of energy policy
and exercises a co-ordinating function over activities in Scotland—such as
the location of industry, the creation of employment and the land-based
facilities needed for North Sea oil—which are not his direct responsibility
but have an important effect on the country’s economy. United Kingdom
government departments with significant Scottish responsibilities have offices
in Scotland with delegated powers, and work closely with the Scottish Office.
The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers: the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters,
in order to reflect distinctive Scottish features and the different conditions
and needs of the country and its people, there is separate legislation relating
wholly to Scotland, or else clauses of special application to Scotland only are
inserted in Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has a general re¬
sponsibility for, and in most cases administers, government measures for the
promotion and development of farming in Scotland. It also has responsibilities
for the oversight and protection of the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh¬
water fisheries, and functions relating to certain harbours.

The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of services
affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and country
planning, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage, coast protection, flood
prevention, building standards and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered by local authorities). The department is also
responsible for general policy in regard to local government organisation and
finance and for ancient monuments and historic buildings.
The Scottish Economic Planning Development is responsible for industrial and
economic development including the Scottish aspects of regional policies and
the economic aspects of North Sea oil development; selective assistance to
industry; oversight of the Scottish Development Agency; rural development,
including supervision of the Highlands and Islands Development Board;
electricity; new towns; certain transport functions including oversight of the
Scottish Transport Group; and assistance for shipping services, ferry services,
pier work, and air services in the Highlands and Islands.
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for the development of
public education in Scotland in all its forms (except universities). Through its
Social Work Services Group the department has a responsibility for the
guidance of local authorities in their provision and development of social work
services. It is also concerned with sport, including the financing of the
Scottish Sports Council, and with the development of the arts, with responsi¬
bility for the administration of the National Galleries of Scotland, the
Royal Scottish Museum (including the Scottish United Services Museum),
the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and the National Library of
Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for the central
administration of functions relating to law and order, including the police
service, criminal justice (other than the conduct of prosecutions) and legal aid
and the administration of penal institutions. It also has responsibility for the
administration of the National Health Service in Scotland, legislation relating
to public service superannuation schemes in Scotland and the administration
of the teachers’ and National Health Service superannuation schemes. The
Home and Health Department is the central authority in Scotland for the
fire service, for certain home defence and emergency services, and for legisla¬
tion concerning shops, theatres, cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure
matters. It is responsible for Scottish aspects of devolution.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the

purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecution in the Sheriff and District Courts,
which are conducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of
this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department
and the Scottish Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s
Department also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain govern¬
ment departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work
relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts
and court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions
in the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
proposals for law reform and questions involving private international law,
international conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and
procedure of the Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
Northern Ireland has traditionally had its own subordinate legislature respon¬
sible for a broad range of domestic matters. The Government of Ireland Act
1920 enacted a constitution which, while preserving the supreme authority of
the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to that Parlia¬
ment, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive to
deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters. These arrangements remained in
force until 1972 when, following several years’ political instability and violence
in Northern Ireland, a period of direct rule was introduced, with executive
powers exercised by a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and laws made
by Order in Council. In 1973 a new type of constitution for the Province
provided, among other things, for the devolution of powers to a legislative
assembly and a power-sharing executive. These arrangements came into force
in January 1974, but following widespread opposition in Northern Ireland
the Assembly was prorogued in May 1974- In July I974Northern Ireland
Act was introduced, providing for the election of a Constitutional Convention
to consider what arrangements for the government of Northern Ireland would
be likely to command most widespread acceptance throughout the community.
The Act provided that, in the interim period (defined as one year from the
passing of the Act), the United Kingdom Government and Parliament
should continue to be responsible for law and order, electoral matters and
business of national importance, such as foreign policy, defence and certain
aspects of taxation, while the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should
be responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament for the devolved services
(such as agriculture, commerce, education, health, finance and the environ¬
ment). It further provided that, during this period, laws for Northern Ireland
on matters formerly within the competence of the Assembly should be made
by Order in Council. The Northern Ireland Assembly was dissolved at the
end of March 1975, and elections to the Constitutional Convention and its
first meeting took place in May of that year. In March 1976} the Convention
was dissolved by Order in Council, having failed to reach agreement on the
central issue of a system of government within a divided community which

would provide for a form of partnership and participation. Northern Ireland,
therefore, continues to be governed by direct rule, as laid down under the
1974 Act, Northern Ireland departments with executive responsibility for
the devolved matters being the responsibility of ministers in the Northern
Ireland Office.
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamen¬
tary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is fully answer-
able to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. In addition to
exercising personal responsibility for constitutional developments, law and
order and security in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State is closely con¬
cerned with financial and economic matters in the Province. The four other
ministers are in charge of the various Northern Ireland departments, the activi¬
ties of which are co-ordinated as necessary.
The Northern Ireland departments’ functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of Northern
Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Its functions also include
the collection of agricultural census data, the compilation of statistics, the pro¬
vision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and the promotion of agricul¬
tural research, education and training.
The Department of the Civil Service is responsible for the general management
and control of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of Northern
Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes of
assistance to industry. The department also has responsibilities in connection
with electricity and other fuel undertakings; harbours (other than fishery har¬
bours) ; the tourist trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries;
mineral development; consumer protection; the registration of companies,
societies, credit unions and insurance and unit trusts; and the administration
of an industrial forensic science department.
The Department of Education’s functions include the development of educa¬
tion and the library services; teacher training; examinations; youth welfare and
youth services; museums; the Arts Council for Northern Ireland; and the
Armagh Observatory. The department is also responsible for sport and
recreation, policies for the improvement of community relations and grants
to relieve special social need in urban areas.
The Department of the Environment is responsible for housing, planning,
comprehensive development, the construction and maintenance of roads and
bridges, water supply and sewerage services, local government, the Develop¬
ment Officer service, transport and traffic matters (including road safety), pol¬
lution control, amenity lands (country parks, nature reserves and areas of
natural beauty), environmental public health, historic buildings and ancient
monuments, street lighting and the fire service.
The Department of Finance’s responsibilities include the control of the expen¬
diture of the Northern Ireland departments, liaison with the United Kingdom

The department also has certain duties in relation to: constitutional and
legal policies and law reform; charities and charitable funds; provision and
maintenance of public buildings; building regulations, liaison with the con¬
struction industry; property valuation; ordnance survey; public records, the
registration of births; deaths and marriages; the registration of titles; land;
miscellaneous licensing functions; and the registration of clubs.
The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for all aspects of
health and personal social services and the administration of the social security
schemes.
The Department of Manpower Services is responsible for the administration of
the employment service in Northern Ireland; employment statistics, an advi¬
sory service to companies; sponsorship of Enterprise Ulster; and government
training centres and various industrial training schemes. The department also
has functions in connection with industrial relations, provides the factory in¬
spectorate and is concerned with disabled persons, contracts of employment,
redundancy pay and wages councils.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who usually is paid wholly and directly out of money
voted by Parliament and works in a civil capacity in a department of govern¬
ment. Some civil servants, however, work for Crown bodies, which are not
government departments (the Manpower Services Commission and its agen¬
cies are examples), and are paid out of government grants to these bodies. In¬
cluding part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to
one full-time), there are about 750,000 civil servants (just over one-third of
them women), roughly 331,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public
services—paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and contribu¬
tions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and providing services to
industry and agriculture. About 270,000 are employed in the Ministry of
Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The
rest are about equally divided between: central administrative and policy
duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing and
information; and largely financially self-supporting services, for instance those
provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Over 70 per cent of civil servants work outside the London area, and plans
have been made for further dispersal from the capital.
The total of civil servants includes about 180,000 industrial staff, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered, and differ quite substanti¬
ally, from those for non-industrial grades.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of staff.
Ministers sometimes personally appoint special advisers, who are none the
GOVERNMENT
59
less civil servants and are paid from public funds, to give them advice on policy
matters. Such appointments lapse when the Government’s term of office ends.
Structure Following the report of the Fulton committee which in 1968 assessed the struc¬
ture, recruitment and management, including management training, of the
service, the Civil Service has been undergoing a programme of reshaping and
modernisation to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
The structure of the Home Civil Service, which before 1968 tended to reflect
the assumption that specific types of work should be allocated to particular
classes of civil servants on the basis of narrow or vocational qualifications, is
being redesigned to provide for a more flexible deployment of staff so that talent
can be used to the best advantage and the highest levels of the Civil Service seen
to be open to people of outstanding ability, whatever their specialist background
or original method of entry to the service. These structural changes involve the
abolition of classes, and are being allied with personnel management policies
designed to ensure that, although work requiring specialist skill is always done
by appropriately qualified individuals, people with the necessary aptitudes are
given opportunities to gain suitably wide experience to fit them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is an open and unified struc¬
ture, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and under
secretary available for all types of posts. Posts at these levels are filled by the
people most suitable for them without regard to their academic background or
to whether they were previously in a specialist or generalist stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of occupational
groups, which are the basic groupings of staff for the purposes of pay, recruit¬
ment and personnel management, and categories which consist of one or more
occupational groups having a common pay and grading pattern. Nine cate¬
gories have so far been created, and the groups of staff that are so far members
of them are shown below.
Categories There are five groups within the General Category. The Administration Group
contains some 230,000 staff. Their functions range from the co-ordination
and improvement of government machinery and the formulation of advice to
ministers on matters of policy to the performance of normal clerical duties
connected with the running of departmental business at lower levels. The
Economist Group contains about 300 staff. They provide economic advice
and undertake economic analysis. The Statistician Group (some 450 staff)
undertakes the collection and analysis of statistics required for government
policies. The Information Officer Group (some 1,350 staff) carries out a
variety of specialised press, publicity, public relations and information work.
The Librarian Group (some 350 staff) carries out the professional librarian
duties in departmental libraries.
The Science Category contains the Science Group (18,000 staff), which is
responsible for conducting scientific research and testing in numerous govern¬
ment laboratories and testing establishments, and for providing advice on
scientific policy. Its members also participate in the planning and management
of advanced technology procurement projects.
There are two groups in the Professional and Technical Category. The
Professional and Technical Group contains some 40,000 staff and includes
a range of professionals—architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors, and
electrical and mechanical engineers—and appropriate supporting staff, whose
main function is to plan and oversee a wide range of government construction
6o
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and procurement activities, and to carry out certain inspection and regulatory
activities. The Illustrator Group contains about 500 staff responsible for the
preparation of all forms of artwork applied to the wide range of requirements
within the government service.
Within the Training Category the Instructional Officer Group comprises
some 4,000 staff employed on instruction in a trade, craft or subject, or on ancil¬
lary or supervisory duties connected with instruction.
The Legal Category contains the Legal Group (England and Wales) and the
Legal Group (Scotland), a total of some 850 staff who carry out a wide range of
legal work for government departments.
The Police Category consists of a single Police Group of some 4,000 staff
who form an internal constabulary to carry out normal police functions in
Ministry of Defence establishments.
The Secretarial Group within the Secretarial Category comprises 23,000
typists, who work mainly in small groups, and some 4,600 personal secretaries
who work mainly for senior civil servants.
The Data Processing Category contains a single group of 8,000 staff who
operate processing equipment in computer and other machine installations.
The 43,000 staff employed in the single group within the Social Security
Category work in local offices of the Department of Health and Social Security.
The nine categories already established account for over 70 per cent of the
non-industrial staff. The intention is that the remainder (including support
staff such as paperkeepers, messengers and office-keepers) will be absorbed into
existing categories or, where this is impossible, into additional categories
set up for the purpose.
The
Diplomatic
Service
The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (it directly administers some 6,500 civil servants) for
service in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom dip¬
lomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Common¬
wealth countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating with
overseas governments and conducting business in international organisations;
promoting British exports and the advancement of British trade; administering
British aid; presenting British ideas, policies and objectives to the people of
overseas countries; and protecting British interests abroad.
The service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service. It also has secretarial, communications and security
officer branches. Various specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or attachment to the
Diplomatic Service. . .
An official review of all aspects of Britain’s overseas representation, including
the Diplomatic Service, began in 1976.
The Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differ-
Northern Ireland ences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment t>eing
Civil Service effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of sta
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for
departmental agreement in individual cases.
Public Services
of Overseas
Dependent
Territories
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but when
vacancies cannot be filled by this means the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Crown Agents for
Recruitment
Training
GOVERNMENT 6l
Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other candi¬
dates, principally from the United Kingdom.
Recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Com¬
mission which, working in conjunction with departments', ensures that staff
are selected on the basis of fair and open competition. The selection of junior
staff, especially those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken almost
entirely by departments. The commission, however, always issues the ‘certifi¬
cate of qualification’ necessary for permanent appointment. The appointment
of a successful candidate is made by the department concerned.
For the Administration Group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by a
series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an inter¬
view by the Final Selection Board. The next level (the Executive Officer Entry)
selection from among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is
in two stages, a series of qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the
clerical entrants selection is normally by interview only,
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications in the subject concerned, and selection is on the basis of past
record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. A substantial number of management courses is run
within the Civil Service both by departments and by the Civil Service College.
Some use is also made of external management courses in business schools, the
Administrative Staff College, Henley, and other centres.
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and programmed learning. There is also a considerable amount of ‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different branches
of their department and sometimes between departments so that they can gain
as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 to attend appropriate courses
usually on one day a week (‘day release’ schemes). Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Personnel Management (Training) Division
of the Civil Service Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the
Civil Service College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be
met centrally, and which exercises advisory functions in regard to departmental
training. All central training is provided by the Civil Service College which
offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a broad developmental
nature and others more job-related) for civil servants, including those in specia-
62

list groups, at various levels up to and including that of under secretary. Sub¬
jects covered include structure and machinery of government, personnel
management, economics, statistics, social administration, operational research,
computers and information systems. The college also provides courses on Euro¬
pean institutions and their working, and has developed an exchange scheme
with other European countries.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to Deputy
Secretary-level posts and above and all transfers between departments at these
levels are approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head
of the Home Civil Service. ,
Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but a procedure of accelerated
promotion has been worked out for administration trainees and officers who
have shown exceptional promise but are outside the age and salary limit for a
particular grade.
Conditions of
Service
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed jointly
of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections
of the service is provided through the various staff associations which civil ser¬
vants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public Services Associa¬
tion, the Society of Civil Servants and the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair com¬
parison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he re¬
ceives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to whic
he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of
the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice he enjoys a
considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every civil servant who is
capable and efficient may reasonably expect a full career in the public service
and is entitled to receive pension benefits.
It is possible for staff to interrupt their careers, or to have special leave
granted, to look after domestic responsibilities, and staff who resign may apply
later to rejoin the service in the grade they held at the time of resignation.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work as long as necessary wit
out additional pay. The standard working week for office staff is 42 hours (41
in London). Annual leave varies according to grade and length of service up to a
maximum of 30 working days a year.
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in any 12 months, and on reduced
pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years; any officer whose
health is permanently impaired may be retired.
Political and The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
Private Activities political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the Government of the ay
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
GOVERNMENT
Security
63
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their appoint¬
ment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected they will
be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the declaration of the
election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the need for
discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in most activi¬
ties except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred from
national political activities though they may seek permission to take part in local
government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service the com¬
pletely free groups are mostly ancillary staff such as cleaners and messengers.
The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical and typing
grades and the granting of permission by the department depends, broadly, on
the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to take part in
national political activities. Permission is usually granted to members of all
groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the avoid¬
ance of any conflict with official duties. Where permission is granted, it is sub¬
ject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department of
election or co-option to a local council. A committee of inquiry was set up by
the Government in May 1976 to review the rules governing political participa¬
tion by civil servants.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions on
appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections. They
may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do
not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the
Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920,1 and the Prevention of Corruption Act
1926. However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further
his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and
business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in public contracts and
he may not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without
the approval of his department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil duties in which secrecy is so vitally important
to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified in employing
anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this reason no one
who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in sympathy with, the
Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable to be a security risk
in any other respect, is employed on secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposi¬
tion, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service
and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security arrange¬
ments is necessary or desirable.
!.LThe1Gov:ernment is preparing proposals to amend the Official Secrets Acts and to
liberalise the practice relating to official information.

Principal Types
of Local
Authority
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The local government system comprises a pattern of elected councils for
defined areas. The councils represent their own localities, provide a local level
of democracy and make available a wide range of services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament (or by measures made under the authority of an Act). The
actual administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are
the responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services, Acts
of Parliament dealing with local government give government ministers defined
powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national uniformity
in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health, while others
are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some services the
minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others there are strictly
limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central government con¬
trols over local authorities are kept to a minimum.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local govern¬
ment give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory circu¬
lars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ire¬
land, the Department of the Environment.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales (out¬
side Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county authori¬
ties, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale
local government services, while the districts are responsible for the more
local ones (see p. 66). However, in six of the English counties, which are in
heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility
for certain large-scale services rests with the district authorities. In England
populations in the non-metropolitan counties range from 287,000 to about
1-4 million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about 111,000 is an excep¬
tion), and in the metropolitan counties from i*2 to 2-8 million. District authori¬
ties within metropolitan counties have populations of between 172,000 and
i-i million; other districts’ populations average between 75,000 and 100,000,
although many fall outside this range. The local government system in Wales
closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England. Populations in the
counties range from 101,000 to 540,000, and the districts have populations of
between 19,000 and 284,000. English parish councils or meetings in villages and
small towns serve as focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited powers of
local interest. In Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 610 square miles (1,580
sq km) and a population of some 7*1 million—is administered by the Greater
London Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations rang¬
ing from 136,000 to 325,000) and the Corporation of the City of London (the
historic centre which has a resident population of less than 6,000).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis. nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Constitution
and Election of
Councils
GOVERNMENT 65
Western Isles. Local community councils are being formed to express local
views and to take action in the interests of the community.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland local environmental services are the responsibility of
26 district councils; area boards and local offices responsible to the appropriate
central departments administer other services at a local level.
Local authorities comprise a number of elected unpaid councillors presided
over by a chairman. They can claim flat-rate attendance allowance as of right
(without proof of loss of earnings) on the performance of council business; they
are also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim for duties within their own areas.
In England and Wales each council annually elects a chairman and vice-
chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of borough granted by royal
charter and some are cities. In boroughs and cities the chairman is normally
known as the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other cities, he is known
as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish regions and islands the chairman is called the
convener; no general title is laid down for district chairmen, but some are
known as conveners, while others continue to use the old burghal title of
‘provost’ (‘lord provost’ in four districts which have city status).
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. In England and Wales county council elections will take
place in 1977 and every fourth year thereafter. The metropolitan district elec¬
tions are held for a third of the seats in each year when there is no county council
election; the non-metropolitan district councils can adopt the same procedure
or choose block elections in 197^) J979 an<^ every fourth year thereafter. In
London the next Greater London Council elections will be held in 1977, and
elections to the London borough councils will take place in 1978. In Scotland
the next elections for the regions will be in 1978, and for the districts in 1977.
Elections for the district councils in Northern Ireland will take place in 1977
and every fourth year thereafter.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not
subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for
the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a
local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled
annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland the
qualification for voting is a little different.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands
as a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. He must be
of British nationality and aged 21 or over. In addition, he must be registered as
a local government elector in the area of the local authority to which he seeks
election; or have resided or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or other pre¬
mises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day on which
he is nominated as a candidate; or, in that 12 months, have had his principal
or only place of work there. A candidate is also subject to a number of statutory
disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable people do not offer them¬
selves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
66
Functions and
Services
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors in accordance with
orders made by the Home Secretary. Districts in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In'Scotland in the regions and islands
areas the electoral areas are called electoral divisions, each returning a single
member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly returning a single
member. For parish or community council elections in England and Wales,
each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a combination of parishes)
forms an electoral area which returns one or more members. For elections to
the Greater London Council, Greater London is divided into electoral divi¬
sions, each returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are
more restricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat con¬
tested in his electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give
more than one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland the 1973 i°ca^
government elections were held on the basis of proportional representation.
Facilities for postal voting were available to those who wished to use them.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties mandatory on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England all county councils are responsible for such matters as strategic
planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer pro¬
tection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the
personal social services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan
areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are
responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most
planning applications and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street
car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an independent committee of the GLC. Responsibility for highways
in London is divided according to the type of road: the main strategic road net¬
work is a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs look after the other
roads. The boroughs are primarily responsible for the provision of housing,
although the GLC also maintains a stock of housing. It is additionally involved
in such matters as the provision of housing outside London for people from the
London area, assisting the inner London boroughs in relation to slum clearance,

the provision of accommodation for people on the London boroughs’ housing
waiting lists, and the rehousing of its own tenants and those of the London
boroughs whose accommodation needs have changed. Greater London and
certain areas just outside are policed by the Metropolitan Police Force.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metropolitan
areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils are re¬
sponsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the county
council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities; and they
may, exceptionally, exercise library and consumer protection functions.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their func¬
tions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The exceptions
to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the personal social
services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales,
including some at both levels. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because
of their isolation, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental services are administered by the
district councils, but responsibility for planning and control of roads, water
supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district by a local office of the
Northern Ireland Department of the Environment working closely with the
district council and its staff. Area boards, responsible to appropriate central
departments, administer locally education, public libraries and the health and
personal social services. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, responsible
to the Department of the Environment, administers housing.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own in¬
ternal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they dis¬
charge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system, whereby
questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and committees are
appointed to administer the various services. Parish and community councils in
England and Wales are often able to do their work efficiently in full session
although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary. Some
councils have established policy advisory or co-ordinating committees with
powers to originate policy, subject to the approval of the full council.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be advisory
or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p. 70), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally reserved to
the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the discharge
of their functions. These include co-operation through joint committees, joint
teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions for another,
and may also supply others with a range of goods and services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Some 2-8 million
68

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These include ad¬
ministrative, professional and technical staff, manual workers and teachers.
Although a few appointments, such as chief education and fire officers and the
director of social services, must by law be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size and composition of their
work forces and the way they should be used. An authority must not, however,
employ one of its own councillors.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind;
subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional, clerical or
technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical
work for which the. council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually
made at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees are informed
of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council, although there are recommended scales.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was nearly £17,000 million in 1975. A clear distinction is made
between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just under a
quarter of the total) is normally financed by borrowing. Housing, the major
element, accounts for almost a third of the total. The education service accounts
for about a third of current expenditure, followed by the police, the personal
social services, roads, and refuse disposal. Current expenditure is financed from
three principal sources: government grants (over a half in 1975); local rates paid
by occupiers of land and buildings (almost a third); and rents from council
houses, and other income (about a sixth). Each local authority is responsible
for its own finance, although in a few cases several authorities combine to orga¬
nise a specialised service which it would be uneconomic for each authority to
provide on its own.
The report of an independent committee of inquiry into local government
finance was published in May 1976.
Government ‘rate support grants’ to local authorities are paid in aid of revenues
generally. Grants are also paid towards the cost of specific services—either
towards current expenditure, such as on the police, or towards capital expen¬
diture, such as on the acquisition and clearance of derelict land. Annual
subsidies are paid for local authority housing.
Rate support grants are distributed among authorities in three parts: the
‘needs’ element which is designed to give most help to authorities whose spend¬
ing needs are greatest; the ‘resources’ element, which is used to supplement the
rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of population falls
below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’ element,
which compensates authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders. The formula for
distributing the ‘needs’ element is subject to annual variations. Grants are also
made towards the cost of rate rebates for poorer people.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a
resources element towards the services they provide.
GOVERNMENT
69
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of non-agricultural land and build¬
ings to meet the cost of local services (after allowing for grants and other
income). Each occupier’s payment is calculated annually by the rating authority
by multiplying the rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its
annual rental value) by the rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value
fixed by the authority according to its projected financial needs. Rateable values
are assessed periodically in England and Wales by the Board of Inland Revenue,
which is independent of local authorities. The present valuation lists came into
force in 1973 (1976 in Northern Ireland). Disputes about rating assessments
are heard by local valuation courts, and then, on appeal, by the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales; but
it is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional and islands councils.
Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each valuation area and
thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Sessions. In
Northern Ireland valuations are carried out by the Valuation Office of the De¬
partment of Finance. There is a right of appeal.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the district councils and London borough councils. Expenditure by
county councils and the Greater London Council is met by contributions from
district councils and London borough councils respectively, who take these into
account in the rates they levy. In Scotland, every authority determines a rate
for its own services, but the collection of rates and the administration of rating
is the responsibility of regional and islands councils. In Northern Ireland rates
are set by the district councils (district rate) and by the Department of Finance
(regional rate); both are collected by the department.
Agricultural land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and
places of religious worship are exempted from rate payments, and in Scotland
and Northern Ireland industry and freight transport are rated at a half and a
quarter, respectively, of their net annual value. Householders (and all other
ratepayers in Scotland) benefit from rate reductions financed by government
grant and they have the right to pay rates in ten instalments a year. House¬
holders with small incomes are entitled to rebates. Charities pay half the full
rate on property they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further
reliefs by the rating authorities, which can reduce or remit the rates for a range
of non-profit-making bodies. Full rates may be levied on empty properties. In
Northern Ireland the degree of charitable exemption is decided by the Valua¬
tion Office; empty properties are not rated.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers conferred by national legislation. For items of expenditure in
key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in England
and Wales must seek approval from the government department concerned
before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority receives an
annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums to borrow and
what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for parliamentary sanc¬
tion to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure. In Northern Ireland
the government department responsible for the service also issues the appro¬
priate loan approvals. In Scotland departmental approval is given to capital ex¬
penditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland,

to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a propor¬
tion of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a
limited proportion of their current outstanding loan debt..
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on b'ehalf of the council con¬
cerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy
of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory requirement for
local authorities to appoint a finance committee, but they have to make proper
arrangements for the administration of their financial affairs.) Local authorities
must have their accounts audited. Those in England and Wales can choose
between the district auditor (appointed by the Secretary of State for the En¬
vironment) and an approved private auditor (or partly both). In Scotland the
auditing of accounts is the responsibility of an independent Commission for
Local Authority Accounts appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland it is carried out by local government auditors appointed by
the Department of the Environment.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves inde¬
pendent statutory Commissions for Local Administration (one each for Eng¬
land and Wales) comprising a number of local commissioners, each responsible
in a particular area of the country for investigating citizens’ complaints of mal¬
administration by local authorities. In Scotland there is a single Commissioner
for Local Administration. The commissioners help local authority councillors
to protect the interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by local authorities,
and certain other public bodies.
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities, aided by
central government through the rate support grant (see p. 68). Every part of
the country is covered by a public fire brigade. Northern Ireland has its own
service responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Each of 63 fire authorities in the United Kingdom must by law make provision
for fire-fighting purposes, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient
strength to meet efficiently all normal requirements (in some parts of Scotland,
authorities are combined to provide fire cover). Other fire-fighting organisa¬
tions are maintained, for instance, by the Army and Air Force Departments of
the Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Industry at certain establish¬
ments ; and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotland respec¬
tively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring the operational effi¬
ciency of brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regulations on such
matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training and equipment,
pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for reduc¬
tions in the operational establishments of fire brigades. Each minister is advised
by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the re¬
spective home departments, representatives of the local authority associations,

and of the associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons
with special qualifications, appointed by the minister concerned. Inspectorates
of fire services advise the ministers on operational and technical matters.
Most fire brigade establishments include part-time retained personnel to aug¬
ment and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call-out
and attendance fee. Volunteer members (who receive no remuneration) under¬
take to attend a fire if called upon. Fire authorities also employ people for duties
in controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. Some brigades
have schemes for the employment of juniors of 16-18 years, prior to their enrol¬
ment as regular firemen at the age of 18.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
personnel, the number and location of fire stations and the number and type of
appliances considered necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area.
Establishment schemes vary according to the fire risks in the area concerned. In
the United Kingdom there are about 34,000 full-time and 17,500 part-time
operational members of fire brigades.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school. Management and command training is provided for the higher
and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, where high-level operational
studies are also conducted. Fire prevention, practical firemanship, advance¬
ment and instructor training for junior and middle ranks is provided at the Fire
Service Technical College. Both colleges are maintained by the Home Office
and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Facilities for officers from
overseas fire services to study the organisation, current training methods,
appliances and equipment of British fire brigades are arranged by the Home
Office Fire Department.
Every fire authority must buy such appliances and equipment as may be neces¬
sary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in its area. Certain
items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete interchange-
ability when a fire is attended by personnel and appliances from more than one
area. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by fire authori¬
ties to requirement specifications approved by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department on the advice of the respective Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that minimum stan¬
dards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to meet special cir¬
cumstances and encourage further developments.
In the United Kingdom some 5,000 fire-fighting appliances are used (includ-
ing pumps, turntable ladders, water tenders, emergency tenders and hose¬
laying lorries), and are housed in nearly 2,000 fire stations.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the Chief Fire Officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which
most brigade areas are divided are responsible for mobilising forces to deal with
outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time an outbreak of
fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent from one or
72
Special Services

Research
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another fire authority.
Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the nearest
available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are in fact used in a variety of emer¬
gencies (such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding
of premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals
from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades are also
used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying swimming pools
and filling water tanks.
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention measures required under a
wide range of statutes relating to most buildings to which the public have resort
or in which they are employed. The authorities are also under a statutory duty
to give advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of fires, and means of
escape in case of fire. Courses in fire prevention are held at the Fire Service
Technical College for fire brigade officers.
Fire precautions are not normally required by law in private dwellings, so
that, in addition to enforcement duties, brigades are also involved in educa¬
tional and publicity activities to promote fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on all these fire prevention matters by the
Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Coun¬
cils, representing the service and central and local authorities.
Research into the different aspects of fire is undertaken by a number of govern¬
ment departments and other organisations. A comprehensive programme of
research into fire brigade operations, organisation, fire-fighting appliances and
equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help of the fire service
under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research of the Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects are undertaken by
the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or, under contract to the Home
Office, by other government agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, \\ hich
is part of the Building Research Establishment of the Department of the En¬
vironment, or by private consultants.
The Fire Research Station is the main organisation undertaking the study
and investigation of the technical aspects of fire. Its work is supervised by a
steering committee, the membership of which is drawn from the Department
of the Environment, the Home Office and independent sources.
3 Membership of the
European
Community
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original six
countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxem¬
bourg and the Netherlands—in the European Community on ist January 1973.
British membership of the Community was endorsed in June 1975 by a
more than two-to-one majority in the first national referendum to be held in
Britain. Some 67-2 per cent of those voting wanted Britain to remain in the
Community, against 32-8 per cent who voted for withdrawal. Almost 65 per
cent of those eligible to vote did so.
The British Government recommended that the British people should sup¬
port continued Community membership in the referendum after the objectives
of its policy of renegotiating some aspects of its membership had been largely
achieved.
Details of Britain’s participation in the development of Community policies
in specific sectors are contained in the appropriate chapters.
Formation of The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
the European treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Communities Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. These are des¬
cribed briefly in the following pages.
The European The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1952 by
Coal and Steel bringing together the coal and steel resources of the six member countries, and
Community formed the model for the ‘community’ approach to economic integration. The
ECSC is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal and steel to member
countries, to promote the rational expansion and modernisation of production
and to provide better conditions of employment and living for the employees
in the industries. The Treaty of Paris, which established the ECSC and was
signed in 1951, provided for the abolition of duties and quantitative restrictions
(or charges having the same effect) on trade in coal and steel between member
States; of discrimination by producers in prices, delivery terms or transport
rates; of any measures which hampered free choice of supplier; and of restric¬
tive practices resulting in the collusive sharing or exploitation of markets.
The treaty also provided for action by the Community over a wide field of
activity in the coal and steel industries, the work of the Community being
financed by a levy on production. The Community provides funds for capital
investment, research and other programmes, as well as loans to help create new
jobs in declining coal areas or where restructuring of thr steel industry is
taking place. Grants to assist redundant coal and steel workers until they find
new employment, or while undergoing retraining, are also made.

Act
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957* I* aimed to promote the continued
and balanced expansion of the members’ economies by their progressive har¬
monisation and integration. The preamble to the treaty included among the
basic objectives of the EEC the establishment of the foundations for a growing
unity among European peoples, the improvement of their working and living
conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade, and the develop¬
ment of the prosperity of overseas countries. The initial steps towards the
attainment of these objectives were the creation of a customs union, abolition
of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and establishment of a common
external tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture, and the
introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour, capital
and services. At the same time, provision was made for the overseas countries
which had special links with the member countries to have preferential treat¬
ment in aid and the development of trade.
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a second
treaty signed in Rome in 1957, which provided for the co-ordinated develop¬
ment of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful nuclear
activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research programme
(for power production, industrial and medical purposes) and to ensure the
dissemination of technical information, to facilitate the co-ordination of invest¬
ment in the nuclear field, and to ensure a proper supply of nuclear ores and
fuels and wider commercial outlets. A common market for all nuclear materials
and equipment came into effect at the beginning of 1959, with a common ex¬
ternal tariff on imports of nuclear materials, while the Community has estab¬
lished common nuclear legislation and a common control system for nuclear
materials to prevent their diversion to purposes other than those declared.
The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
member States in January 1972. Britain thereby became a party to the two
separate Treaties of Rome establishing the EEC and Euratom, adjusted as
necessary to take account of enlargement. Accession to the ECSC was effected
by a decision of the Council of Ministers.
The Treaty of Accession provided for a transitional period during which
tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the original six
members have been progressively reduced; on 1st July 1977 they will be
abolished and the phased introduction of the common external tariff on British
imports from countries neither members of, nor having any special arrange¬
ments with, the Community will be complete. In addition, Britain has been
progressively adopting the Community system of agricultural support (the
CAP) during a transitional period ending on 3ist December I977- The treaty
provided for a slightly longer period of adjustment with regard to payments
to the Community budget. Other provisions included those relating to
participation in the Community’s institutions and to its relations with
Commonwealth and other countries.
The European Communities Act became law in October 1972 and made the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community, and to exercise the rights of membership.
The Act gave the force of law in Britain to that part of Community law which
is directly applicable in member States. It also contained detailed legislation (in
part repealing or amending existing statutes) to implement Community obliga-
Community Law
Institutions
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY 75
tions. Other Community obligations are being met under existing powers to
make subordinate legislation, introduced as the measures become applicable.
Community policies are implemented by means of regulations, which are
legally binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives,
which are binding on those member States to whom they are addressed regard¬
ing their objectives, but allow national authorities to decide on the means of
implementation; decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are
addressed (for example, member States, firms, or individuals); and recommen¬
dations and opinions, which have no binding force.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three Com¬
munities were merged in 1967. The Community institutions, comprising the
Council of Ministers, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Assembly
or European Parliament and others, including a number dealing with specific
subjects, provide a framework within which the interests of the member States
are represented and reconciled and common policies formulated and adminis¬
tered. In each of the institutions Britain has a position equal to that of France,
the Federal Republic of Germany or Italy. English is one of the official lan¬
guages of the Community.
The Council of Ministers is the final decision-making body for all major
Community questions and is the only institution established by the treaties
whose members, usually the foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to
the subject of discussion, directly represent each member country. Most
council decisions are taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
Where member States’ vital interests are involved, the council’s practice is to
proceed only on the basis of unanimity. Some issues may be decided by
majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to provisions in
the Treaty of Accession.
The Presidency of the Council (the chairmanship of meetings of the council
and its subordinate bodies) changes at six-monthly intervals. Britain will
occupy the Presidency for the first half of 1977.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. It has some limited powers of
decision relating mainly to the detailed administration of the CAP. It is com¬
posed of 13 commissioners nominated by the member governments; two are
from Britain. The President of the Commission, who is appointed for a two-
year renewable term, acts as the Commission’s representative and is respon¬
sible for its general administration. Each of the other commissioners is
responsible for one or more of the main Community activities. The Com¬
mission is pledged to act in complete independence of national or sectional
interests and to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the interests
of the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made only after extensive
consultation with officials of the national governments and with producers,
trade unions, employers’ associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Com¬
mission under them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Com¬
munity institutions, member States or individuals and gives preliminary rulings
on questions referred to it by courts in the member States. As a court of final

appeal its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest
courts in member States; its rulings are binding on member countries, Com¬
munity institutions and individuals. The Court of Justice consists of nine
judges, assisted by four advocates-general.
The Assembly or European Parliament is currently composed of nominated
members of the parliaments of member States, sitting according to party
affiliation and not nationality. Britain is entitled to nominate 36 members out
of a total of 198. The parliament is consulted on and debates all the major
policy issues of the Community. Members of the parliament may question
the Council of Ministers and Commission and have the power to dismiss the
Commission by a two-thirds majority. It may reject in its entirety the Com¬
munity’s draft annual budget; measures to strengthen its scrutiny of past
Community expenditure are being introduced. In future the Assembly is to be
directly elected and its size is to be increased to 410 members. It is hoped that it
will be possible to hold the first direct election in 1978.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives consists of representatives of
the member States of ambassadorial rank, whose task is to prepare for the
meetings of the council and perform whatever additional functions it might
delegate.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other interests—are consulted by the Council
of Ministers and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is
entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 144.
Other Community institutions include the European Investment Bank, and
the European Monetary Co-operation Fund and the Court of Auditors.
In addition to, and separate from, these Community institutions, the mem¬
ber States have set up the European political co-operation machinery for the
consideration of important problems of foreign policy. The Community
foreign ministers meet in this framework four times annually. Under the
foreign ministers there is a structure of official committees. The country having
the Presidency of the Council of Ministers provides the Secretariat. Close con¬
tact is maintained with Community institutions when this is appropriate, and
decisions are made on the basis of consensus.
The Community’s heads of Government meet at least three times annually
as the European Council in order to ensure progress and consistency in the
activities of the Community. The European Council combines the functions of
a meeting of the Council of Ministers with those of a meeting held within the
context of political co-operation.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific pur¬
poses, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials FEOGA),
the European Social Fund (used for occupational retraining and re-adaptation
programmes and programmes designed to further manpower mobility), the
Regional Development Fund, and administrative costs. Under the direct in¬
come system, which came into effect for the original members in January I97I>
the Community finances this budget directly from the revenue of customs
duties and of levies on agricultural imports. Except for a 10 per cent rebate
to cover collection costs, all levies on agricultural imports and all customs
revenues are handed over to the Community budget by the original six mem¬
ber States. The remaining proportion of the necessary income (taking into
account the new members’ contributions, described below in the case of
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
77
Britain) is made up by contributions from the six original member States
according to their shares of the Community’s gross national product (GNP);
eventually this will be replaced by a proportion (equivalent to up to a i per
cent rate) of the proceeds of the value added tax.
The Treaty of Accession gave Britain a transitional period up to 1980 in
which to adopt this system. The treaty set a percentage (or key) based on
Britain’s share of the total GNP of the nine countries in the enlarged Com¬
munity. This represented the proportion of the budget which Britain would
nominally have been expected to pay in the first year of membership. During
the transitional period, Britain is paying a proportion of its nominal contribu¬
tion, increasing in annual steps, from some 8-75 per cent of the budget in 1973
to about 19 per cent in 1977. For the two-year period after 1977, the British
contribution is not to increase by more than a limited amount.
A ‘correcting mechanism’ has been established providing for repayments to
a member State whose contribution to the Community budget is seriously out
of line with its share of total Community GNP and its economic situation.
4 Justice and the Law
Sources of Law
Branches of the
Law
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law applicable universally within its limits. England and Wales on the one
hand and Scotland on the other have their own distinctive legal systems and
law courts. Common opinions on broader issues, and a common final court of
appeal in civil matters have resulted in substantial identity on many points, but
considerable differences remain in law and in procedure and practice. In
Northern Ireland legal procedure and practice have for centuries closely
resembled those of England and Wales but there are often differences in
enacted law. However, a large volume of modern legislation, particularly in the
social field, applies throughout the United Kingdom.
The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common law
and European Community law. Legislation consists of laws made by or under
the authority of Parliament and may be Acts of Parliament; ‘delegated legisla¬
tion’—orders, rules and regulations made by ministers under the authority of
an Act of Parliament; or by-laws made by local government or other authorities
exercising powers conferred upon them by Parliament. Common law is the
ancient law of the land as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges.
Generally speaking it has never been precisely defined or codified but forms the
basis of the law other than where it has been superseded by legislation.
Community law (see p. 75), which arises out of the United Kingdom’s
membership of the European Community, is largely confined in impact to
economic and certain social matters. It stands alongside both domestic legisla¬
tion and the common law and in the event of conflict takes precedence over
them. The law is normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the European Court of Justice (see p. 75)*
A feature common to the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. The criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole while civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
society between themselves.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Four distinct stages are involved in the British system of criminal justice: the
enactment of criminal legislation which, for instance, defines prohibited acts,
establishes criminal courts and provides for the treatment of offenders; the
prevention of crime and the enforcement of the law—largely matters for the
police service; the determination by the courts of the guilt or innocence of
people accused of crimes and the selection of appropriate sentences for the
guilty; and the treatment of convicted offenders, both within the com¬
munity and within prisons and other custodial centres.
The Criminal
Law
Crime Statistics
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 79
The criminal law, like the law generally, undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet
new circumstances. Substantial changes in the law are the responsibility of
Parliament through the normal legislative process. In practice most legislation
affecting the criminal law is government-sponsored, but there is often con¬
sultation between the government departments concerned and bodies repre¬
senting the legal profession and the police. Less formally, the views of
commentators and interested parties are taken into account in determining
policy.
Local chief officers of police have a duty to supply statistics relating to offences,
offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their areas. Abstracts
of this information are published every year and further information about
crime trends (as well as about police matters) is contained in the annual reports
of the Chief Inspectors of Constabulary and (for London) the Commissioner of
Police of the Metropolis.
The differences in the legal systems of the constituent countries make it
impractical to analyse in detail trends in criminality for the United Kingdom
and even within one area the accuracy of statistics is reduced by a number of
factors; for instance, the public’s readiness to report incidents, the general level
of tolerance towards certain types of anti-social behaviour and the amount of
police resources allotted to different aspects of their work may all vary from one
time to another. Nevertheless, it is clear that, as in western Europe generally,
there has been an upsurge in crime since the early 1950s.
Of the serious offences known to police in England and Wales in 1975,
however, offences of violence against the person formed less than four per cent
and sexual offences less than two per cent. Over 85 per cent of the known
offences comprised burglary, theft and the handling of stolen goods and a
majority of these crimes involved property worth less than £25.
The number of recorded offences per 100,000 people in England and Wales
*n I975 was about 4,280 (see Table 5). The police ‘clear-up’ rate was 44 per
cent, although this figure conceals regional variations (the rate for England and
Wales outside London was 49 per cent) and wide variations for different types
of offence; for example, 81 per cent of known offences of violence against the

person were cleared up, compared with 38 per cent of criminal damage
offences.
Most offenders are proceeded against in court (some 2 million people, less
than 10 per cent of them women, were convicted of offences in England and
Wales in 1975) but some may be given written or oral cautions by the police
(136,000 in 1975). Of the people convicted of offences, about a fifth were guilty
of indictable (the more serious) crimes. Of these, just under half were under 21
years of age.
A wide range of criminological and other social research is carried out by the
Home Office Research Unit which also co-operates on research matters with the
Scottish Home and Health Department. Research is carried out in university
departments, much of it financed by the Home Office and the Scottish Home
and Health Department. The principal university research establishment is the
Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.
Studies undertaken in the Home Office Research Unit are mainly concen¬
trated on subjects of direct interest to home departments. The results of the
unit’s work are published in learned journals and in the Home Office Research
Studies series. First degree courses (normally in law, sociology or social
administration) which include some study of criminology, one-year post¬
graduate courses and research facilities are available at a number of universities.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was established in 1964 to
provide ex gratia compensation to victims of crimes of violence and people hurt
as a result of attempts to arrest offenders and prevent offences. It is administer¬
ed by a board which consists of legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation with
the Lord Chancellor. Compensation, which is assessed on the basis of common
law damages and usually takes the form of a lump sum payment, has totalled
some £31 million since the scheme began. A review of the scheme is in progress
with a view to putting it on a statutory basis.
The scheme does not apply in Northern Ireland where there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for compensation from public funds for
criminal injuries caused to people and also for malicious damage to property
(see p. 81). Compensation for property damage includes consequential
losses (of profits) arising from the damage.
Various temporary measures to deal with terrorism in connection with
Northern Ireland have affected some aspects of the British criminal justice
system. The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976,
for example, contains powers of three main kinds: it enables organisations
to be proscribed which are concerned in terrorism connected with Northern
Ireland affairs; it enables the Home Secretary to exclude from Great Britain
or Northern Ireland, or in certain cases from the United Kingdom as a
whole, people concerned in terrorism designed to influence public opinion
or government policy over affairs in Northern Ireland; and it provides
powers of arrest and detention for people concerned in terrorism, and
enables a system of travel controls to be imposed between Great Britain and
Ireland.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 creates extra-territorial offences under
Northern Ireland law so that it is possible to try in the province a person
accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It also enables
evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences in the

Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation has been passed by the Irish Parliament.
Trials in Northern Ireland criminal courts of offences involving terrorism
are heard by a judge sitting alone (that is, without a jury, see p. 104, to
obviate the possibility of intimidation of juries or of perverse acquittals by
partisan juries).
As a result of the civil disturbances in the province since 1969, some £20
million has been paid from public funds in compensation for personal
injuries and about £140 million for damages to property (see p. 80).
Crime prevention and crime investigation, the preservation of the peace and
the bringing to trial of offenders are primarily the concern of the police service,
although it has been recognised since the days of the earliest police forces that
public approval and co-operation are essential to the maintenance of law and
order. The sanction of the British police in enforcing the law rests mainly upon
common consent, in particular because of the small number of officers in
relation to the population (roughly one officer to 500 people), because of the
strict limitations on police powers and because of the fact that officers do not
normally carry firearms (their only weapon is a wooden truncheon).
The police service in Great Britain comprises 51 independent forces linked with
local government—43 in England and Wales and eight in Scotland. Central
government ministers, the Home Secretary (for England and Wales) and the
Secretary of State for Scotland, have overall responsibility for the preservation
of law and order. Each force is responsible for law enforcement in its own area,
but there is constant co-operation among them. The Northern Ireland police
service is organised in a single force (see p. 84).
Outside London most counties (regions or islands in Scotland) have their
own police forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined
their forces. In London, the Metropolitan Police Force, with headquarters at
New Scotland Yard, is responsible for an area within a radius of about 15 miles
(2 \ kilometres) from the centre but excluding the City of London, where there
is a separate force. The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is
about 118,000 (including over 6,000 policewomen), the size of individual police
forces depending on the area and population which they serve. The strength of
the Metropolitan Police Force is about 21,000.
In addition to the regular police forces, constabularies are maintained by the
British Railways Board and some other public authorities and by the Ministry
of Defence. Considerable numbers of people are employed by commercial
security organisations (which are subject to the ordinary law of the land).
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority. The
authority is a committee consisting of local councillors and (in England and
Wales) magistrates. The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is
the Home Secretary.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. Its functions, some
of which are subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the chief
constable and deputy and assistant chief constables and, if necessary, calling
upon them to retire; fixing the establishment of the force and the number of
officers in each rank; appointing traffic wardens; and providing and maintaining
buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the chief officer of
police and his immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation
of the Home Secretary.

Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below deputy or
assistant chief constable; they are, however, generally answerable to the police
authorities on matters of efficiency, and must every year submit a written report.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are concerned
both in the general organisation of the police service and in its administration
and operation. They approve the appointment of chief constables, and may
require a police authority to retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency,
call for a report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the policing
of his area, or cause a local inquiry to be held. They are also empowered to make
regulations, with which all police authorities must comply, covering such
matters as rank; qualifications for appointment, promotion and retirement;
discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and uniform and equip¬
ment. Some of these regulations are first negotiable on the Police Council (a
negotiating body on which are represented the police authorities, police staff
associations and ministers); others are discussed on representative advisory
bodies, together with any general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection on behalf
of ministers. Inspectors of constabulary carry out, under Her Majesty’s Chief
Inspector of Constabulary and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary
for Scotland, a formal annual inspection of the forces in their regions, inquiring
into efficiency and reporting to the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for
Scotland. Annual reports are published, covering the whole range of police
matters. The inspectors also maintain close touch with forces for which they are
responsible, and have various advisory functions.
The income of police authorities derives from central Government, the ‘rates’
(a form of local property tax) and various other local sources. The Government’s
contribution, a half of approved expenditure (a third in the City of London),
is conditional on the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland
being satisfied that the force is being efficiently administered and maintained.
Officers and In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men and women between
Ancillary Staff the ages of 18 J and 30. An individual chief constable may approve the appoint¬
ment of especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan Police
area, are: chief constable, assistant chief constable, chief superintendent,
superintendent, chief inspector, inspector, sergeant and constable. The chief
officer in the Metropolitan Police area, the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis, is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commission¬
ers. Next in rank are deputy assistant commissioners, and then commanders;
from chief superintendent the ranks are the same as in the regions. In
the City of London the ranks are the same as in the regions except that the chief
officer is the Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an assistant
commissioner, and there is one commander.
Cadet training is designed to prepare boys and girls between 16 and i8| years
of age for a career in the police service. They have no police powers but, in
addition to their educational studies and physical and adventure training, are
instructed in elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for opera-

tional duties police authorities employ over 35,000 civilians on administrative
duties (pay, records, finance and other general subjects), technical duties
(fingerprint, scenes of crime and control room work) and other duties,
including catering and domestic work.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are over 7,000) are extensively employed to
discharge specified duties connected with road traffic, vehicles and pedestrians
normally undertaken by the police. In this connection they may be authorised
to serve fixed penalty notices1 for some aspects of minor offences; to man police
car-pounds (except in Scotland); to enforce some aspects of the vehicle excise
laws; and to obtain the names and addresses of people thought to have com¬
mitted certain types of traffic offence. They may also be authorised to direct
traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as school¬
crossing patrols, if the police agree. Wardens remain under the control of
the chief constable of the force to which they are attached, whatever their
duties.
Each police force has an attachment of special constables, who are volunteers
willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England and
Wales the function of special constables is to act as auxiliaries to the regular
force when required. In Scotland they are employed only in emergencies
although they may be assigned for duty for training purposes.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office and
exercises his powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by com¬
mon law, by virtue of his office. He is an agent of the law of the land, not of the
police authority nor of the central Government and, although his chief officer of
police has a vicarious liability for any wrongful act he may commit in the
performance of his functions as a constable, he himself may also be sued in
respect of his own wrongful act. Strict procedures govern the way complaints
against police officers are handled and an independent element is being
introduced into the way complaints are investigated in England and Wales.
Similar proposals are to be made for Scotland.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political
bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have their own
associations which can make representations to ministers or to police authorities
on matters of interest or concern to their members.
The many functions of a police officer as a constable range from the pro¬
tection of people and property, road or street patrolling and traffic control to
crime prevention, criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
Modern police work inevitably includes many ‘social’ functions—ranging from
special juvenile liaison and community relations schemes to involvement with
family and health matters.
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department, the
criminal investigation department and the traffic department. Many forces also
have specialised departments, including river police (in districts with stretches
of navigable waterway), a mounted branch and dog handlers.
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments for the benefit of all forces to supplement those provided by the police
authorities for their own use and by communal arrangements made between the

forces themselves. The most important of these services are: training services, a
forensic science service in England and Wales which provides eight regional
laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory); telecom¬
munications services, including depots which in England and Wales supply and
maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central and provincial criminal
records which are' available to all forces. In addition, regional crime squads,
consisting of teams of experienced detectives from several forces, operating
under a committee of chief constables, are employed in England and Wales to
investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one police area. The
Scottish Crime Squad operates in the same way throughout Scotland.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropoli¬
tan Police Force. The services of the force are available, on request, to assist
any other police force in England and Wales in criminal investigation, as are
the services of the Fraud Squad, which is run jointly by the Metropolitan
Police and the City of London Police for the investigation of company frauds.
Research into technical services is organised in separate units within the
Home Office’s Police Department: the Forensic Science Service, with its
regional laboratories; a Central Research Establishment staffed by scientists;
a Directorate of Telecommunications with one section of engineers engaged
solely on research and development; and the Police Scientific Development
Branch, staffed by scientists and technicians assisted by seconded police
officers "from the Police Research Services Unit—both being concerned with
operational research into police methods and the development of equipment
for police forces. Co-ordination and policy are the responsibility of a separate
division. The Economic Planning Unit, composed mainly of economists and
accountants, is responsible for the development of a planning-programming¬
budgeting system for the police; this includes the production of programme
accounts and studies of the use of resources.
In all aspects of police work, the application of scientific aids has reached an
advanced stage. A national police computer is being developed to rationalise
the keeping of records and speeding up the dissemination of information.
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland has a statutory duty to maintain an
adequate and efficient police service. As in Great Britain, the chief constable
is responsible for the control and direction of his force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which has a strength of nearly 5,000. Ranks, conditions of
service, pay and general duties follow closely on the lines of the service in Great
Britain. The regular force is assisted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve,
a largely part-time body of men and women.
Criminal proceedings in England and Wales are held either in magistrates’
courts, where cases are tried under summary procedure without a jury, or in
the Crown Court, where the more serious cases are tried on indictment with a
jury. Magistrates’ courts also conduct preliminary investigations into the more
serious cases. Average waiting times for people committed by magistrates for
trial in the Crown Court are about ten weeks.
One of the principal features of criminal courts in England and Wales is the
important part played by laymen who have no special legal qualifications—as
magistrates who are the justices of the peace (the ‘judges’ in most magistrates’
courts), as members of juries and as prosecutors (most criminal prosecutions
are initiated by the police). About 98 per cent of all criminal cases are finally
heard and determined by magistrates.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Magistrates’
Courts
The Crown Court
Appeals
85
The 900 or so magistrates’ courts normally consist of a ‘bench’ of three lay
unpaid magistrates whose function is to ascertain the facts of a case and apply
the law to them. The magistrates are advised on points of law and procedure by
a clerk to the justices (or one of his assistants) who is normally legally qualified
and is also in charge of the administrative matters of the court.
In inner London and some other large urban areas where the pressure of work
is heavy and continuous there are also professional ‘stipendiary’ magistrates who
are full-time, salaried and legally qualified. They usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a more serious case to see whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify committal for trial in the Crown Court the evidence must not be reported
in the press at the time except at the defendant’s request, unless the magistrates
discharge him.
Magistrates cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months’
imprisonment or a fine exceeding ^40°* If an offence carries a higher maximum
penalty, they may commit the offender for sentence to the Crown Court if they
consider their own power inadequate.
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court in
‘care’ (see p. 96) or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for
the adoption of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts. Juvenile
courts sit either in a different room or building from other courts, or at a
different time, and only limited publicity is allowed. If a young person
under the age of 17 is charged jointly with someone of 17 or over, the case
is heard in the ordinary magistrates’ court. If the young person is found
guilty, that court remits the case to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to
dispose of the case by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court is responsible for trials of the more serious cases, the senten¬
cing of offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts and appeals
from magistrates’ courts. It has about 90 centres and is served by High Court
judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and recorders, who sit on a part-time basis.
All trials in the court take place before a jury. Lay magistrates have a role
to play in the court; a circuit judge or recorder sits with between two and
four magistrates for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’
courts and may sit with magistrates to try the less important cases. For the
most serious cases a High Court judge sits alone.
Of nearly 68,000 people tried in the Crown Court in 1975, 63 per cent pleaded
guilty to all charges, 22 per cent were convicted after trial and 15 per cent were
acquitted on all counts.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal against the conviction or
against the sentence to the Crown Court. Where the appeal is on a point of law
either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’ court
to the High Court. Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or
against sentence, are normally made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division).
The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) normally consists of three judges, who
may be Lords Justices of Appeal or judges of the High Court, although the Lord
Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal usually presides. A further appeal
from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to the House of Lords can be
brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance is
involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point is one
that ought to be considered by the House. A prosecutor or defendant may appeal
to the House of Lords from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
86
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point
of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his consent.
Scotland Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff courts are tried under
solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure in the less
serious cases in the sheriff courts, and in the district courts.
District Courts The system of lay summary courts is based on the district and islands areas of
local government. Judges in the district courts are justices of the peace, includ¬
ing up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands authorities who
may be nominated as ex o^zczo justices. In Glasgow there are three stipendiary
magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
Sheriff Courts For purposes of sheriff court jurisdiction, Scotland is divided into six sheriff¬
doms and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts. A
sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs who are legally
qualified and act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an
extensive civil as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both a
of Justiciary trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled to try
cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord
President of the Court of Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 18
Lords Commissioner of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court of Session.
The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at
trials in other towns.
Appeals A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may
appeal to the High Court of Justiciary {a) against his conviction on any ground
which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or upon
the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case for appeal,
on any ground, and (6) against his sentence, with the leave of the High Court,
unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard by three or more
judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
Children’s Hearings Children under 16 years (and in some cases people between 16 and 18) who are
considered to need compulsory care are normally brought before an informal
children’s hearing comprising three members of the local community. (Pro¬
secution in the criminal courts is rare, and may take place only on the instruc¬
tions of the Lord Advocate.) An official ‘reporter’ decides whether a child
should come before a hearing. The hearing’s main task is to decide, after the
grounds for referral have been accepted by the child and his parents, what
measures of compulsory care (if any) are most appropriate. If the grounds for
referral are not accepted, the case must first go to the sheriff court for proof. An
appeal lies from the decision of a hearing.

JUSTICE AND THE LAW 87
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor local criminal cases in
Northern Ireland is carried out in petty sessions districts by magistrates’ courts
presided over by a professional, paid resident magistrate. Young offenders under
17 years and young people under 17 who need care, protection and control are
dealt with by juvenile courts consisting of the resident magistrate and two lay
members (at least one of whom must be a woman) with special qualifications for
dealing with juveniles. Appeals may be made to a county court.
The county courts and the High Court of Justice share a similar jurisdiction
in criminal matters, except that the most serious cases, such as murder, are tried
in the High Court only. Other cases are in practice heard at the court where the
trial can be heard soonest. For people convicted of serious crimes there may be
an appeal to the Northern Ireland Court of Criminal Appeal and from there
to the House of Lords.
Most of the work -of coroners’ courts nowadays involves the investigation of
violent and unnatural deaths or of sudden deaths where the cause is unknown.
Cases may be brought to the notice of the local coroner (a senior lawyer or
doctor appointed by local government) by doctors, the police, various public
authorities or members of the public, and it is his duty to hold an inquiry into
how, when and where the deceased died. If the death is a sudden one of which
the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest in court, but may
order a post-mortem examination to determine cause of death. If, however, he
has reason to believe that the deceased died a violent or unnatural death or died
in prison or other circumstances provided for by statute, he must hold an
inquest. Moreover, if he has reason to suspect that the death was due to murder,
suicide, manslaughter or infanticide or was caused in a road accident, he must
summon a jury.
The courts’ other functions include dealing with ‘treasure trove’ matters.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown
Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
Coroners in Northern Ireland are mostly senior lawyers; the work of their
courts is broadly equivalent to that of coroners’ courts in England and Wales.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces and
in certain circumstances their dependants and other civilians who accompany
them outside the United Kingdom. The courts do not deal with certain serious
offences if committed in the United Kingdom, such as treason, murder, man¬
slaughter, treason-felony and rape. Other non-military criminal offences
committed by servicemen in the United Kingdom are also normally dealt
with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and a number of serving
officers) may be convened by an authorised officer. A judge advocate is appointed
to sit with the court in more serious Army and Air Force cases (and at every
Navy trial) to advise upon law and procedure and in the former case, to sum up
the evidence.
There is a system of appeals for people convicted by a court martial.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the police
and in Scotland and Northern Ireland with public prosecutors. Police have
powers to issue cautions (warnings in Scotland) instead of prosecuting,
especially in the case of young people.
88
Arrest
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a ‘contest’ between
the Crown and the accused person. In England and Wales (and very exception¬
ally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal proceedings, but they
are usually initiated and conducted by the police.
Some offences in England and Wales can be prosecuted only by or with the
consent of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Where
the consent of the Attorney General is required (for example, under the official
secrets legislation), such prosecutions are invariably in the hands of the director
(a senior civil servant and prominent lawyer appointed by the Home Secretary)
who is responsible to the Attorney General. His other duties include. pro¬
secuting all serious offences, which must be reported to him by the police;
advising the police and others concerned with the administration of the criminal
law; and taking over, where necessary, criminal proceedings instituted by
another prosecutor. He is also concerned with complaints of criminal offences
by the police, extradition and offences committed by foreign servicemen
stationed in England and Wales.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these are
drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel appointed by the Attorney General.
Each year the director’s department conducts between five and ten per cent
of the prosecutions brought on indictment in England and Wales, it also con¬
ducts some summary prosecutions.
In Scotland the Lord Advocate, acting through the Crown Office and
subordinate prosecutors, is responsible for the prosecution of practically all
crimes before Scottish courts. The Crown Office is concerned with the pre¬
paration of prosecutions in the High Court; the public prosecutors in the sheriff
courts and district courts, known as ‘procurators fiscal’, are lawyers who are
usually full-time civil servants. The police make preliminary investigation of all
offences known to them, and report the details to the procurator fiscal, who can
decide whether to prosecute, subject to the discretion and control of the Crown
Office. Private prosecutions, though permitted in some circumstances, are
rare-
The Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, has functions which include the initiation of criminal
proceedings in certain circumstances, representing the Crown in criminal
actions, and prosecuting offences against statutory provisions on behalf of
government departments. The director also has functions in relation to the
granting of bail.
In criminal cases in England and W ales arrest may be effected either on a
warrant issued by a judicial authority on sworn information laid before it or, in
certain cases, without warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may
release the defendant on bail; that is, he may discharge him temporarily to
appear in court or at a police station at an appointed time. It is an offence to
abscond while on bail. If the defendant cannot be brought before the
magistrates’ court within a day, and his alleged offence is not serious, the
police must release him on bail. Magistrates also have discretion to grant
bail, which they exercise according to well-defined principles. If bail is
refused by the magistrates, the defendant is entitled to apply to the Crown
Court or the High Court, and he must be informed of this right. There is a
statutory presumption in favour of the granting of bail.
Some 85 per cent of people remanded by magistrates courts in 1974 were
granted bail, compared with 66 per cent in 1967.
Trial
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 89
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambiguity
in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges’ Rules
which do not have the force of law but carry very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person then being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or by
someone acting on his behalf.
In Scotland the police have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges’ Rules do not apply, but when
anyone is arrested he must be cautioned and have the charge read over to him.
Thereafter, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence at his trial, and
the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is satisfied that they
have been fairly obtained. As in England and Wales, when anyone is appre¬
hended in Scotland he must be brought before a court with the least possible
delay. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the accused is
brought before a judge for judicial examination and the judge may then
commit him for trial or for further examination. Eight days may elapse
between commitment for further examination and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or by
the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right
of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail, by
the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the amount
fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials must, in
any event, be brought to a conclusion within 110 days of committal to custody.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until his
guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage, apparent or
real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal adviser for his
defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal aid wholly or
partly at the public expense. If remanded in custody he may be visited in prison
by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly prepared. During the
preparation of the case, it is customary for the prosecution to inform the defence
of any relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and to
disclose them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also inform the defence
of any witnesses whose evidence may assist the accused and whom the pro¬
secution does not propose to call. The defence or prosecution may suggest
that the mental state of the defendant is such that he is unfit to be tried. A jury
must decide whether or not this is so. If they find that it is, the defendant will be
admitted to a hospital specified by the Home Secretary.
Criminal trials in England and Wales are (with rare exceptions) held in open
Lsmful grounds aie: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered;
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly authorised
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus applies in both criminal and civil cases.
9°
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
court and the law of evidence (which is concerned with the way facts may be
proved and what facts may not be proved) is rigorously applied. If evidence is
admitted in contravention of the law, a resultant conviction is liable to be
quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to cross-
examine (normally through his lawyer) all the witnesses for the prosecution; to
call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own free will,
may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either in person or
through his lawyer—the defence having the right to the last speech at the trial.
Moreover, the defendant cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be
sworn as a witness in his own defence. When he does testify, he may only be
cross-examined about his character or other conduct in very exceptional
circumstances and generally, the prosecution may not introduce evidence of
such matters. Although confessions made in the course of previous judicial
proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no
confessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it can be
proved that they were made voluntarily.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up the
evidence for the benefit of the jury, and discharges the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides whether,
on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, the defendant is guilty or not
guilty. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous; in certain circumstances
the jury may bring in a majority verdict provided that, in the normal jury of 12
people, there are not more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal against the verdict and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal on the part of the
defendant to the appropriate court.
At summary trials in Scotland the accused is asked to plead to the charge at
the first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a later date.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place in
the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not
guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ pro¬
ceedings in the appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and the case is to
be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a
High Court case, it is continued to the second proceedings in the Court for
disposal.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading proceed¬
ings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15. Evidence is
led (without opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecu¬
tion and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury
may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in
acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds
to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple majority. With a few
minor exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence of at
least two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances
which clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
PENAL SYSTEMS The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Treatment of
Offenders
9i
deterrence is in the probability of detection, public trial and punishment rather
than in the severity of the punishment itself.
Imprisonment and, for certain categories of young offender, other forms of
custodial treatment form an important part of British penal practice, but are
increasingly seen as the last resort in dealing with people who break the law.
Wherever possible and appropriate for the safety of the public, the treatment
of offenders within the community is regarded as preferable to custodial
treatment.
Traditional non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute or
(in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three
years (one year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made when there
is properly a conviction but the court feels that there is no need to impose
punishment; and ‘binding over’ where the offender is required to pledge
money, with or without sureties, ‘to keep the peace and be of good behaviour’.
The suspended sentence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland means that
an offender does not actually serve his sentence unless he is convicted of a further
offence punishable with imprisonment within a specified period (maximum
two years). If he is convicted of such an offence within the period of a suspended
sentence, the sentence normally takes effect and a further sentence may be
imposed for the new offence. An offender given a suspended sentence of
over six months may, in England and Wales, be made subject to supervision by
a probation officer for all or part of the period of the suspended sentence.
A recent innovation is the scheme for unpaid community service by offenders
convicted of imprisonable offences in England and Wales. The scheme began
experimentally in several areas but initial results were encouraging and the
arrangements have been extended to many other parts of the country. There
are provisions for probation hostels, intensive supervision and day training
centres. An offender may also with his consent have his sentence deferred for
up to six months to enable a court to arrive at the most appropriate sentence,
taking into account his conduct after, for instance, some expected change in his
circumstances.
The courts may order an offender to pay compensation for any personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from his offence and in the case of major crimes
against property bankruptcy proceedings may be brought against him in
England and Wales. In Scotland a committee is considering the potential role
of the criminal court in ordering reparation by the offender to the victim.
In certain circumstances the courts may order the forfeiture of property
involved in the commission of a crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime
may be disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
The mandatory penalty for murder in the United Kingdom is imprisonment
for life. This is also the maximum penalty in England and Wales for man¬
slaughter and certain other very serious offences, including rape, robbery
offences and arson, but in almost all other cases the courts have complete dis¬
cretion to select the sentence in the light of the nature and gravity of the offence
and the available information about the offender. In certain cases this discretion
is modified by statutory provisions designed to ensure that prison sentences are
kept to a minimum.
In Scotland, unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty
is determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indict¬
ment, the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up
to life and the Sheriff Court up to two years. In summary cases, the sheriff may
impose up to three or, in some cases, six months’ imprisonment.

Probation
Prisons
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In all parts of Britain, there are special provisions for dealing with children in
trouble and young adult offenders (see pp. 96-98). In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, a person who has not previously served a custodial sentence
of a particular kind may not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind
unless he is legally represented or has chosen not to be, and in the case of
imprisonment unless the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. On
the other hand, in England and Wales special sentences longer than the normal
maximum term (extended sentences) may be imposed on persistent offenders.
In the interests of the rehabilitation of offenders, anyone in Great Britain who
has received a prison sentence of up to 2| years and then has managed to avoid
further convictions for a specified period (the time depends upon the nature of
the original sentence) is entitled for most purposes to treat his ‘spent’ conviction
as though it had never occurred (for instance, in some judicial proceedings and
in most applications for employment).
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
continues his ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer, whose
duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. Before making a probation order
(which lasts for between one and three years), the court must explain its effects
and make sure that the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with
the requirements of the order he will be liable to be dealt with again for the
original offence. A probation order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of
age or over and must have his consent; it usually requires the probationer to
keep in regular touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to
lead an industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or in
appropriate circumstances to submit to treatment for his mental condition.
The probation service is administered locally by probation and after-care
committees. Probation officers are usually members of small teams, although
each has a large measure of independence in his or her casework with an
offender.
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days for intensive supervision and social educa¬
tion as a requirement of a probation order), bail hostels, probation hostels and
other establishments for use in connection with the rehabilitation of offenders.
The service is also responsible for administering the scheme of service to the
community, whereby courts have the power to require offenders to perform, in
their spare time, up to 240 hours (within 12 months) of such unpaid work as
painting and decorating for people in need, building adventure playgrounds and
clearing sites at redevelopment areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court.
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service, offenders subject
to probation orders or to after-care supervision following release from a penal
institution are supervised by specially approved local authority social workers.
Since 1950, the courts have made proportionately less and less use of prison as a
penalty for criminal activity, but there has been a steady rise in the prison
population as a result of the rise in crime. During i975> average number of
people in prison in Great Britain was about 45,000, roughly twice the 1950 level;
the number of prisons and similar establishments was 139, also about twice the
1950 figure; but the size of the prison service, some 21,000-strong, was treble
that of 25 years earlier.

Remission of

93
In spite of this increase in size and the problems that go with it, however, the
keystone of Britain’s prison service is still the ability of the individual prison
officer to handle relationships with difficult people in the exacting environment
of the custodial institution.
The aims of the prison service are, briefly, to provide for the detention of those
committed to custody under the law in conditions generally acceptable to
society, and to develop constructive methods of treatment and training in the
hope that they will lead to the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reform. To this end
prisoners are classified into groups, taking into account the likelihood of their
escaping, the degree to which their escape would offer a threat to the public or
the State, and the justification of high expenditure on providing secure con¬
ditions. People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and as far as practicable are separated from convicted prisoners.
Prisoners under 21 are separated from older prisoners.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
‘local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be open
or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons. Separate prisons cater
for women prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are un¬
satisfactory by modern standards; overcrowding is also a problem. To improve
conditions generally, new prisons are being built and existing establishments
redeveloped and modernised, as far as resources allow.
All prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for an actual term of more than
one month, except those sentenced to imprisonment for life, are allowed remis¬
sion of one-third of their sentence provided that this does not reduce their
sentence below 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission may be forfeited for
serious misconduct in prison. In addition, prisoners serving fixed sentences
totalling more than 18 months become eligible for consideration for release on
parole after serving one-third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever expires
later. (In Northern Ireland there is no parole scheme, but prisoners receive
one-half remission on determinate sentences subject to a liability, in the case of
those serving over a year, to be ordered to serve the outstanding balance of the
remitted period in the event of reconviction for an imprisonable offence.)
The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the prisoner
would have been released if he had not been licensed or, for prisoners serving
extended sentences (in England and Wales only) and offenders sentenced while
under 21 years of age, until the end of the sentence.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consultation with the judiciary and on the recommendation of the Parole Board.
Those released in this way remain on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall at any time should the circumstances warrant it.
The main aim of prison industries is to give an offender in custody a training and
experience that will fit him to get and retain a job on discharge. The primary
source of work lies in the domestic requirements of the prison service itself in
clothing and equipping prisoners and providing furniture and furnishings.
Goods and services are also supplied to other government departments and
public bodies, and there is a steady growth of sales of a wide range of products
in the open market—for example, textiles, woodwork and engineering
products. The profitable farming and horticultural industries also provide
work and training, and play an increasing part in contributing to the prison
food provision. A few prisoners are employed outside prison.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England, Wales and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for the
work they do; in some prisons, special incentive schemes provide an opportunity
for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill. In Northern Ireland there is
a progressive system of earnings, related to work done.
Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more may be considered for
employment in an ordinary civilian job outside prison for about six months
before his discharge. Prisoners selected for the scheme may live either in a
separate part of the prison or in a prison hostel; they are paid normal wages, from
which they support their families and meet their own expenses.
Education for those in custody is provided by local education authorities in
close liaison with central departments. Each prison in England and Wales has
an education officer and a number of part-time teachers.
In many prisons the education officer is nowadays increasingly assisted by
one or more full-time teachers. Attendance at evening classes is voluntary but
full-time day classes are provided for young people under 16 years of age (such
as those in borstals and in junior detention centres) and on a selective basis for
people over that age. Day release may be granted to certain prisoners to improve
their basic education standards or to pursue examination courses. Increasing
numbers of prisoners are taking Open University courses. All inmates have
access to the prison library. Other recreational activities include: films, plays,
concerts, lectures and discussions.
Selected prisoners take vocational training courses leading to recognised
qualifications. Others learn construction industry crafts, and their skills are later
used in maintaining and improving existing establishments and building new
ones. Facilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales.
Physical education in custodial centres aims to promote and maintain
physical fitness and development; to provide opportunities to attain externally
recognised standards of proficiency; and to ensure that men leaving prison are
physically competent to sustain the demands of employment outside. All
offenders under 21 must attend a certain number of classes, but adults may
choose whether to take part.
The physical and mental care of inmates is a statutory duty of the prison medical
officer. Large establishments have medical teams, while others need only the
services of a medical officer on a part-time basis. All have hospital and out¬
patient treatment facilities and the necessary support staff.
In a few prisons there are large hospitals where major surgery and treatment
can be undertaken by visiting specialists. The patients include inmates from
other establishments. There is one psychiatric prison in England and W ales
with accommodation for some 300 inmates. Many establishments have
psychiatric units to which inmates are transferred from other establishments.
Use is also made of hospital and specialist facilities of the National Health
Service, there are several joint appointments in forensic psychiatry with
regional health authorities and, if necessary, arrangements are made for treat¬
ment to continue after release from custody.
There has been a constant development of the application of psychological
principles to the tasks of the penal system over the past 30 years. The work of a
prison psychologist varies from one place to another. Psychologists are involved
in the analysis of operational processes, the evaluation of treatment programmes
and regimes, the assessment of individuals, contributions to management and

treatment and the selection and training of staff. The focus of their work is
primarily upon tasks involving design, development and evaluation.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a general right to write
and receive letters and to be visited by their relatives at regular intervals. They
also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of books,
periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the canteen
with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities available,
they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation in association
and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or board of
visitors (visiting committees in Scotland), who have power to order, among
other penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to prison welfare officers—probation officers seconded by the probation
and after-care service (in Scotland, social workers from local authority social
work departments). The functions of these officers include helping the prisoner
in his relationships with individuals and organisations outside the prison, and
making plans for the prisoner’s after-care, working closely in this connection
with colleagues in the probation and after-care service and with other agencies
in the community whose help the prisoner or his family may need either during
sentence or after release.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors
whose work is voluntary and in England and Wales is co-ordinated and guided
by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of England
(in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland of the Church
of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic priest and a
Methodist minister are appointed to every prison. Ministers of other denomina¬
tions are appointed or specially called in as needed. The chaplaincy programme
not only provides for worship, group work and pastoral counselling, but covers
involvement with other members of staff in treatment and in management.
Prisoners granted parole may have preparatory leave. After-care begins at the
commencement of a prisoner’s sentence, and probation officers arrange inter¬
views for offenders in the cells at court immediately after sentence. Officers
often visit prisoners families to discuss problems and in some areas set up
prisoners wives groups which meet informally and provide a source of mutual
companionship and support.
All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release preparations for
prisoners, varying according to the needs of the inmates concerned. At many
prisons they take the form of open discussion groups at which experts
consider with prisoners the domestic, social and employment problems with
which they are likely to be faced on release. For adult prisoners serving not
less than two years and for women and young prisoners serving not less than 18
months, home leave is extensively granted towards the end of their sentences
to enable them to re-establish links with their families and friends or to make
new contacts with people, including potential employers, who may be able
to assist them on release. For some male prisoners serving four years or more
and for some women serving 18 months or more there are special provisions
for work outside the prison before release.

Children in
Trouble
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are two systems of after-care in England and Wales, both run by the
probation and after-care service. A compulsory system applies to prisoners
released from life imprisonment or extended sentences, young prisoners and
young people discharged from borstals and detention centres; and a voluntary
system is offered to the remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of
voluntary societies, most of which are members of the National Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and other forms of accom¬
modation are provided, often with some financial help from the Home Office.
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are similarly carried out by probation
and after-care officers. In Scotland responsibility for statutory and voluntary
after-care is vested in local authority social workers.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of any offence.
A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an offence may be
the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings, both of which are
normally held before juvenile courts (see p. 85).
To make an order in care proceedings the juvenile court must be satisfied that
any one of a number of conditions is met, one of which is that an offence has been
committed. The court must also believe that the child is in need of care or
control which he is unlikely to receive unless an order is made. This means that
the commission of a criminal offence is not in itself a ground for a court care
order to be made in care proceedings. A care order made in criminal pro¬
ceedings is not subject to the care or control test and can be made where the
child is guilty of an offence which in an adult is punishable by imprisonment.
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal pro¬
ceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority, so that
the authority becomes responsible for deciding where the child should be
accommodated, for example, with foster parents or in a ‘community home’.
The care order generally lasts until the child is aged 18 or 19 unless it is in the
meantime discharged by a court. For children who are too severely disturbed or
disruptive to be treated successfully in other child care homes, youth treatment
centres’ are being provided by the Department of Health and Social Security.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer. He or she may be required to undergo inter¬
mediate treatment’ which is a compromise between measures involving complete
removal from home and those which do not. It consists of participation under a
supervisor in a variety of constructive and remedial activities through a short
residential course or attendance at a day or evening centre.
A court may also order a parent or guardian to enter into recognisances to take
proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him; or may order a
stay in hospital in accordance with the mental health legislation.
In criminal proceedings the courts may also order payments of compensation,
or impose fines or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. If the offender is a
boy, he may be ordered to spend a total of (normally) 12 to 24 hours of his spare
time on Saturdays at one of 60 attendance centres (up to three hours on any one
occasion). The centres are for boys found guilty of offences for which older
people could be sentenced to imprisonment, and provide physical training and
instruction in handicrafts or $ome other practical subject. For boys aged 14 or
over courts may make a detention centre order (see below), and young people of
15 and over may be committed to the Crown Court with a view to borstal
training (see below). In the case of a very serious crime, detention in a place
approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Scotland
Young Adult
Offenders
97
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years, but prosecution is
the exception, and no child can be prosecuted for an offence other than at the
instance of the Lord Advocate. Children under 16 years who have committed an
offence or need care and protection are generally brought before an informal
children’s hearing (not a juvenile court), where the aim is to discuss difficulties
and provide the most appropriate measures of care and treatment (see p. 86).
The hearing can commit a child to supervision by a local authority subject to
conditions appropriate to the child’s needs (this may include a requirement to
stay in a residential home).
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years are recognised as a category distinct from child
and adult offenders and special forms of custodial treatment are devoted to
them. The main non-custodial measures are generally the same as those used
in dealing with adults, although in the London and Manchester areas an
attendance centre order (usually made for younger boys, see above) may be
given. The custodial sentences available are: detention in a detention centre,
borstal training and imprisonment.
Some 12 senior detention centres provide a means of treating young male
offenders in Great Britain for whom a long period of residential training away
from home does not seem necessary or justified by the offence, but who cannot
be taught respect for the law by such non-custodial measures as fines or proba¬
tion. There are also six junior centres for boys aged 14 to 16 years. Detention is
usually for a period of three to six months (a fixed period of three months in
Scotland). Life in a centre is brisk and formal, demanding the highest possible
standard of discipline and achievement. The emphasis is on positive training
which provides a normal working week of 40 hours, including an hour each day
devoted to physical training, with considerable attention paid to education. All
offenders discharged from a detention centre are supervised for a year.
Borstal training aims to bring about a development in the trainee’s character
and capacities, progressively increasing scope for personal decision, responsi¬
bility and self-control, and to enable the trainee to develop as an individual.
Offenders are placed as near their homes as possible so as to maintain and foster
their ties with the local community. The system is essentially remedial and
educational, based on personal training by carefully selected staff. Emphasis is
placed on vocational training in skilled trades. There is much freedom of move¬
ment, and many borstals are open establishments. The training system is
available to offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16 to 20 years in Scotland and North¬
ern Ireland). Courts rarely order borstal training unless they have already tried
fines, probation or detention centre training, perhaps all three. The training
period usually ranges from six months to two years and is followed by super¬
vision in the community.
A person under 17 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment in England
and Wales, and no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender
aged 17 to 20 years unless satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is
appropriate. If imprisonment is imposed, the term must be of either less than
six months or more than three years, unless the offender has served a previous
sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment or a sentence of borstal training,
in which case the lower limit is 18 months. (In other cases, if the court
considers that a medium-term custodial sentence is desirable, the appropriate
sentence is one of borstal training.) Sentences of up to two years may be ordered
by a court to be suspended. Prisoners under the age of 21 at the time of their
sentence are classified as ‘young prisoners’, and serve their sentences separately
from older prisoners unless they are reclassified as adults and treated as such in

where neither borstal nor detention training is suitable for an offender aged
16 to 20 years, detention in a special ‘young offenders’ institution’ may be

CIVIL JUSTICE
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including such concepts as negligence, defama¬
tion and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional and
administrative law, which is particularly concerned with the use of executive
power, industrial law, admiralty law and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law
has its own, often analogous, branches.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates exercise quasi-administrative functions in relation
to the licensing of public houses and of betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are about 330) are so located that no part of the
country is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. In the busier
centres, the courts may sit every day; in others they may sit weekly, monthly, or
at longer intervals.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The jurisdiction of the county courts covers, for instance, actions founded
upon contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount claimed is
not more than £1,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount does not
exceed £5,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net annual value
for rating does not exceed £1,000. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the
county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circumstances be
transferred from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Acts, landlord and tenant and adoption cases. In addition, undefended
divorce cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court) and outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also
deal with complaints of racial discrimination and sex discrimination in
education and the provision of goods, facilities, services and premises. W here
small claims are concerned (especially those for less than £100 involving
consumers), there are special facilities for arbitration and simplified
procedures.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original

Sheriff Courts
The Court of
Session
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules of
court and the practice of the court. For instance, the Family Division deals with
all jurisdiction of a family kind, including matrimonial cases, and cases relating
to wardship, adoption, and guardianship; while Admiralty and prize jurisdic¬
tion rests with a specially constituted Admiralty Court of the Queen’s Bench
Division.
There are 70 High Court judges each of whom is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his term of
office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and of the
Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being the
responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s
Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who
ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family Divi¬
sion is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court sits at
the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 Crown Court
centres which are known as first tier centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
divisional courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the
appropriate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts lie to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court and the county courts
are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may (with leave of the
court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords, which is the
ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) are the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the
Master of the Rolls; the ordinary members are 16 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and some¬
times even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president
of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings
take the form of the normal proceedings of the House: judgments are given
as speeches to a motion, and the House’s decision is taken by a vote.
The main civil courts in Scotland are the sheriff courts which, in their
civil capacity, correspond roughly to English county courts, and the Court
of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is
normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the
sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal
or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action, subject to a few exceptions. The main exception is an action

Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other actions. The
court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and
the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided
into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first
division being presided over by the Lord President and the second division by
the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be made from the
Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House an appeal may
lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and
dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in magistrates’ courts, but
as in England and Wales most civil actions are heard in the county courts. The
superior civil law court is the High Court of Justice and appeal may lie to the
Court of Appeal. Together, these two courts comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature and their practice and procedure are similar to those in the corres¬
ponding English courts. The House of Lords is the final civil appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required.
Actions are usually begun in the High Court by a writ of summons served on the
defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff has a
claim against him and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant intends to
contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by informing the court to this effect
and documents setting out the precise question in dispute (the pleadings) are
then delivered to the court. County court proceedings are initiated by a plaint
served on the defendant by the court; subsequent procedure is simpler than in
the High Court.
A decree for divorce can be obtained only after a hearing in court, whether or
not the case is defended. Civil proceedings, because they are a private matter,
can usually be abandoned or compromised at any time without leave of the
court—the parties to a dispute being able to settle their differences through
their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought
to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases involving
claims for defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, when
either party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the defendant
may claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, the jury is responsible for
deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the amount of damages
to be awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s wages). Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do some¬
thing or to refrain from doing something may result in imprisonment for con¬
tempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a
wafrant of the court. . . ,
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barrister’s fees, solicitors
charges, court fees and other payments) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders them to be paid by the party losing the action.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
101
Restrictive
Practices
Court
Administrative
Tribunals
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a value
exceeding £so°) th6 sheriff court are initiated by the service on the defender
of a summons or initial writ. In Court of Session actions the next step is the
calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in the court lists.
If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter appearance’ within
two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences, otherwise decree in absence
can be obtained against him. In ordinary actions in the sheriff court there is no
calling of the summons; the defender is simply required to enter appearance
within a certain number of days after service of the initial writ, and if he does so
this is followed by the ‘tabling of the cause’ which involves a formal appearance
in court by solicitors or, in some cases, the parties to the dispute. Trial by jury
in civil actions in Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being
the usual form of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries in the
Court of Session. In the sheriff court it is relatively rare, being confined to
actions between employer and employee.
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than ^500) in the sheriff
court the procedure is less formal. The statement of claim is attached to the
summons, which in most cases is a printed form obtained from the sheriff
clerk. The procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through
without the parties involved having to appear in court. They (or their repre¬
sentatives) need appear only when an action is defended or there is some doubt
about the method of paying the debt.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies, restrictive trade practices and resale price main-
tainance. It comprises five judges and up to ten other people with experience
and expertise in industry, commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule,
they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by statute, which
also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions on
which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration, with a
group of people or with another individual. Consequently there has been a sub¬
stantial growth during the past 30 years of administrative tribunals with a
regular or permanent existence and the function of deciding or adjudicating in
disputes arising under regulatory or welfare legislation. Such tribunals include
those concerned with: land and property; national insurance; supplementary
benefits; industrial matters; the National Health Service; transport; taxa¬
tion; and many which do not fall into any specified group. Their constitution
follows a fairly general pattern; usually they consist of an uneven number of
people so that a majority decision can be reached; members are normally
appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but other authorities (for
instance, the Lord Chancellor) have the power of appointment in appropriate
cases; the Lord Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in
Scotland) makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer chairman or
member is required; and, with some exceptions, members hold office for a
specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example of
doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from the
statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.

England and

BRITAIN 1977- AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Appeals from all the more important tribunals may be made, at least on a
point of law, to the High Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An
appeal may also be made to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister
of the Crown or to an independent referee. The Employment Appeal 1 nbunal
which hears appeals on questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals
has High Court and Court of Session status. The Council on Tribunals
(appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate) exercises
general supervision over tribunals and reports on particular matters, those
peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and
is not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice lies upon the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The Prime Minister is concerned with the legal system in that he
recommends the highest judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords). He is the Cabinet minister responsible in England
and Wales for magisterial and all but the most senior judicial appointments.
He is concerned with court procedure and is responsible for the administra¬
tion of all courts other than magistrates’ courts. On the civil law side, law
reform and supervision of the legal aid and advice scheme are matters for him.
The Home Secretary, also a senior Cabinet minister, is concerned with the
criminal law, including law reform. He is responsible for the prevention of
crime, the apprehension of offenders and virtually the whole of the penal
system. He also exercises a general supervision over magistrates courts, with
some specific responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of Clerks to
the Justices). On matters relating to crime prevention and the treatment of
offenders, he is advised by the Advisory Council on the Penal System. Although
probation and after-care of prisoners is carried out by a locally organised
service, the Home Secretary is responsible at a national level for the service s
efficiency and he has wide regulatory powers, being advised by the Advisory
Council for Probation and After-care. Prison policy and the administration of
custodial centres are functions of the Home Office Prison Departments and the
Home Secretary appoints to each centre a board of visitors representing the
local community to investigate and advise him on the state of the buildings,
administration and the treatment of inmates. The boards have certain dis¬
ciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline and they hear
applications or complaints from inmates. The Home Secretary is advised by a
special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
The special provisions within the penal system applying to young offenders
are the responsibility of the Home Office and the Department of Health and
Social Security. (Local authority social services departments also have many
functions relating to children and young people.)
The Home Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to grant a free pardon in connection
with a person’s conviction, or to remit all or part of a penalty wffiich may have
been imposed on an offender by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for the building
and maintenance of county courts and providing accommodation for all the

JUSTICE AND THE LAW 103
superior courts in England and Wales, except the Central Criminal Court in
London, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the' Solicitor General, the Law Officers of the
Crown for England and Wales, are the Government’s principal advisers on
English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international
cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons
and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law in England and
Wales, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (see p. 88) is subject to his
superintendence. The Attorney General is concerned with the institution and
prosecution of certain types of criminal proceedings, but he must exercise an
independent discretion, and must not be influenced by his Government
colleagues. The Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney
General, with similar rights and duties.
In Scotland, all judges other than the most senior ones (and including justices
of the peace) are appointed on the recommendation of the Secretary of State,
who also appoints the staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of
Session and is responsible for the composition, staffing and organisation of the
sheriff court. District courts are staffed and administered by the district and
islands local authorities.
The Secretary of State is responsible for the administration of the penal
system and is advised on crime prevention and the treatment of offenders by the
Scottish Council on Crime. Prison policy is a matter for the Scottish Home and
Health Department and there are visiting committees for each custodial
centre similar to the boards of visitors in England and Wales. The Secretary of
State is advised on parole matters by the Parole Board for Scotland. Scotland
has no separate probation service; local authority social work departments
provide the services and officers required by the criminal courts in their areas.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal repre¬
sentatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord
Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administration,
he is responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and he is responsible
for the public prosecution of all major crimes. He delegates most of the work of
prosecution to the Solicitor General, to seven Advocates Depute and to Pro¬
curators Fiscal who are full-time legally qualified prosecutors. The permanent
adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown Agent who
is also head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of civil
servants known as the Crown Office.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary are appointed on the advice of the Lord
Chancellor. 7 he Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State, deals
with the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions courts
and is responsible for the penal system.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown is
the historic source of all judicial power) and all appointments to the High Court
or the Court of Session are made by the Queen acting on the advice of ministers.

Judges
Juries
The Legal
Profession
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor,
who, as well as being head of the judiciary and speaker of the House of Lords, is
a leading member of the Government. With the exception of lay magistrates,
judges are normally appointed from practising barristers, advocates or
solicitors and neither their training nor their careers are in any way dictated
by the State. Lay magistrates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
need no legal qualifications, being appointed for their qualities of integrity and
understanding and as broadly representative of the community which they
serve. On appointment, however, they give an undertaking to complete a period
of basic training, so that they may obtain a sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and may understand the nature and purpose of
sentencing. A special committee advises the Lord Chancellor on training
policies. Justices of the peace in Scotland likewise need no legal qualifications,
and the Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for providing such training
for them as is necessary. In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and Wales
and Northern Ireland may be removed from their position by the Lord Chan¬
cellor, and in Scotland, by the Secretary of State on a report by the Lord
President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from
the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet Minister, changes
with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the Sovereign
on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there is no
statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High Court
of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.
The jury system is an integral part of the more serious criminal proceedings in
all parts of the United Kingdom and can be a feature of certain civil cases,
although this is fairly rare outside Scotland. In criminal trials by jury it is,
broadly speaking, the judge’s duty to determine questions of law and to dis¬
charge the accused person or pass sentence on him, but the jury (comprising 12,
or, in Scotland, 15 people) has sole responsibility for deciding the question of
guilt or innocence. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous, but the rules
about majority decisions vary according to the legal system.
In some civil actions tried by jury the size of the jury is smaller. It may be
responsible not only for deciding questions of fact but also for fixing the amount
of damages to be awarded to an injured party.
Juries are also summoned to certain inquests at coroners courts.
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
Moreover, although there are provisions for both the prosecution and defence
in criminal trials to object to particular jurors, once members have been sworn
in, they are protected from interference of any kind.
Qualification for jury service is based on residence and the electoral register
(or in Scotland a low property qualification). People following certain occupa¬
tions are either ineligible or entitled to claim excusal and some people with
serious criminal records are disqualified.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the Bar , and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Each branch of the profession per-
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
105
forms distinct duties—solicitors undertake legal business for lay clients, while
barristers advise on legal problems submitted through solicitors and present
cases in the higher courts—though certain functions are common to both.
Although the law allows an individual to conduct his own defence if he
wishes, in important cases most people prefer to be legally represented.
Royal commissions are inquiring into the provision of legal services and con¬
sidering the structure, organisation, entry, training and remuneration of the
legal profession.
In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a
barrister must be a member of one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn, Inner
Temple, Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn). To become a student member of an
Inn, an entrant must normally have a law degree from a United Kingdom
university or polytechnic. People with other degrees and ‘mature’ students may
also be accepted, but they must pass a common professional examination. All
students must pass the professional examinations run by the Council of Legal
Education and must ‘keep terms’ in their Inn. After training, a student can be
called to the Bar, but may not practise independently until he has completed a
year’s pupillage with an established barrister. The governing body of the pro¬
fession is the Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar. The Bar Council (com¬
posed of those members of the Senate who are elected by the Bar) maintains the
standards and independence of the profession and improves its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career. The term of articles lasts for two to four years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and, unless he has been
a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he
may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and The Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including the
necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months or
of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption from
nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine months’
pupillage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must serve an
apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin his pro¬
fessional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is The Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
LEGAL AID,
ADVICE AND
ASSISTANCE
Legal aid is provided for people of limited means to pay for the cost of advice and
assistance and for legal representation in court proceedings. Lawyers’ costs and
the expenses of litigation are paid out of a fund provided by the State.
The fund is entitled to be reimbursed from contributions which assisted
people may have to pay according to their means and costs, damages re-

covered from legally aided people’s opponents in litigation and a government
grant.
Where court proceedings are not involved, people with limited means can
obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter for little or no cost. This includes
giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills and obtaining opinions from a
barrister. A solicitor may act for a client until his costs and expenses reach a
total of £25, but authority may be obtained for this limit to be exceeded. A
person seeking help has to give the solicitor brief details about his income and
savings to show that he comes within the financial limits allowed by the scheme.
The income limit laid down by the scheme is reviewed at least annually.
In some urban areas law centres exist to provide free legal advice; all have at
least one full-time salaried lawyer and most employ community workers. There
are also voluntary legal advice centres in many parts of the country, often linked
with Citizens’ Advice Bureaux.
Legal aid is available to people whose disposable incomes and disposable capital
do not exceed certain prescribed amounts,1 but a contribution is payable accord¬
ing to the level of the applicant’s income; if that is below a prescribed amount,
legal aid is given free of any contribution. As in the case of legal advice and
assistance, the qualifying income limits for aid are reviewed at least once a year.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by The Law Society, The Law Society of
Scotland and The Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
An applicant for legal aid must show that he has reasonable grounds for
taking or defending the proceedings. If his application is successful, he is
entitled to select from a panel a solicitor (who, if necessary, instructs counsel),
and the case is then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes
between the assisted person and his solicitor—payments being made in and out
of the legal aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses against
an unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if the court
so orders, be met out of the fund. Local committees have the right to refuse
assistance if it appears unreasonable that the applicant should receive it in the
particular circumstances of a case; both solicitors and counsel have a duty to
review the case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued unreasonably at
public expense. Legal aid is not generally available in cases where redress is
sought for alleged defamation or in proceedings in administrative tribunals.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and that a
defendant’s means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs
of the proceedings in which he is involved. An order must be made when a per¬
son is committed for trial on a charge of murder or applies for leave to appeal
from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Courts Martial Appeal
Court to the House of Lords. No person can be given a custodial sentence for
the first time unless he is legally represented, or has been refused, or has failed
to apply for, legal aid after having been informed of his right to do so.
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters for which a person may reasonably provide out of income, and deductions for
the value of a person’s house, furniture and other household effects from his capital.
LAW REFORM
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 107
Voluntary duty solicitor schemes at some magistrates’ courts provide ‘stand¬
by’ help for unrepresented defendants.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Home Secretary.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and
the ‘interests of justice’ test applies only in summary cases.
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies, in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform Com¬
mittee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing committees of
judges and distinguished practising and academic lawyers, appointed respectively
by the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the
civil and criminal law as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister.
The Criminal Law Revision Committee has produced 12 reports, ten
recommending legislation, of which nine have been wholly or partly enacted.
The Law Commission is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high
standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enact¬
ments, and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. It reports to the
Lord Chancellor. The Scottish Law Commission, which has a constitution
similar to that of the English body and similar functions in relation to the law
of Scotland, reports to the Lord Advocate. The work of the two commissions
has led to changes in many areas of the law, the repeal of over 500 obsolete Acts
and the pruning of the contents of more than 1,000 others.

5 Defence
Europe
The decisions taken in the 1974 Defence Review, which aimed at reducing
defence costs as a proportion of national resources while maintaining a modern
and effective defence system, continue to form the basis of Britain’s defence
policy. As a result of the review, completed in early 1975 following consulta¬
tions with Britain’s allies, defence forces are being concentrated on those areas
in which a British contribution to collective defence will be most effective in
ensuring the nation’s own security and that of its allies. Thus the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) remains the first and over-riding
charge on Britain’s defence resources, and Britain is withdrawing from its
non-NATO commitments wherever this is consistent with its fundamental
military and political obligations. At the same time, general purpose forces
are being maintained as insurance against the unforeseen.
Reductions in planned defence expenditure for the period 1977/78-1979/80
were announced in February and July 1976 as part of the overall reductions in
public expenditure programmes (see p. 193). The savings will come mainly
from those areas of the support structure not directly associated with front-line
units and from rephasing the works programme. They will not cause any
reductions in Britain’s front-line forces committed to NATO.
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance,
and it is to NATO that by far the greater part of Britain’s military forces is
committed. Britain makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent
capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, required to maintain NATO’s
defensive posture. Within NATO, Britain plays an important part in the efforts
of the European members to assume, through closer co-operation, an increasing
responsibility for Western defence. In the Eurogroup Britain and nine other
European members are working to improve their contribution to the Alliance
and to achieve a more effective collective result from the available resources.
The sub-groups of the Eurogroup, each of which concentrates on a specific
area such as training, logistics and, most importantly, the procurement of
equipment, make an important contribution towards the strength of the
Alliance by increasing co-operation among its members. In addition, NATO
is pursuing a proposal, first put forward in the Eurogroup, to establish a
‘two-way’ street’ in defence procurement between Europe and North America.
Britain also participates in the independent European Programme Group
of all European members of the Alliance; the group has been set up to explore
the potential for extending co-operation among European countries in the
production of defence equipment and for co-ordinating the European end of
the ‘two-way street’.
Britain is playing a major part in the efforts to reduce tension and achieve
more lasting peace in Europe, and is working to ensure that the agreements
with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries on security and
co-operation in Europe, concluded in August 1975, will contribute to increased
stability and improved relations. It is also helping to achieve progress in the
negotiations for mutual and balanced force reductions in Central Europe.

Britain is a member of the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the
South-East Asia Treaty Organisation1 (SEATO) and participates with
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore in the Five-Power defence
arrangements in Malaysia and Singapore. Britain is also responsible for the
defence and internal security of its remaining dependencies. In addition, the
armed forces continue to give assistance to communities overseas, particularly
in such activities as disaster relief and development work.
Britain also plays an active part in the UN and other international bodies
working to eliminate the sources of tension and conflict between nations and
to promote arms control and disarmament. It supports the peacekeeping
efforts of the United Nations—supplying the largest national contingent to
the UN Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus. Britain is a frequent contributor to
debates in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and has played a
leading part in strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons, through the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Review
Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister and
the Cabinet, who are responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence
policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence. In recent
years the emphasis in defence organisation has been on increased central

chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The Chiefs of Staff Committee,
comprising the Chief of the Defence Staff as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff
of the three Services, is responsible for giving professional advice on strategy
and operations, and on the military implications of defence policy. The day-
to-day management of the three Services is the responsibility of the Admiralty,
Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided in an annual
Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 6432 in i97^> published in March).
The defence estimates for 1976-77 totalled ,£5,632 million, which represents
about 5-5 per cent of the estimated gross national product. Of the total expen¬
diture £2,566 million (45 per cent) is on personnel (pay, allowances, pensions),
£1,990 million (36 per cent) on equipment and the remaining £1,076 million
(19 per cent) on buildings and miscellaneous stores and services. (See also
diagram on p. 109.)
DEPLOYMENT
The basis of the present NATO strategy of flexible response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military aggres¬
sion of all kinds is essential. While NATO must be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary, its conventional forces must be maintained to enable it to respond
to aggression at a variety of levels, the level of response being that which enables
NATO to restore the territorial and maritime integrity of the Alliance and
thereby to gain time for negotiations to end a conflict. The strategy requires a
comprehensive range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces and
tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. The British Polaris force makes a unique contribution to NATO’s
strategic deterrent. Virtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked
for assignment in an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes
to NATO’S Standing Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel,
and the Naval On Call Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR) and RAF Germany are deployed in the Federal Republic of Germany
and there is an independent brigade in Berlin. BAOR is organised as a corps of
three divisions with five armoured brigades, one mechanised brigade and two
artillery brigades. (The corps is being reorganised, involving the abolition of
the brigade command level, and by 1979 will comprise four new-style armoured
divisions, an artillery division, and a new infantry formation.) Its peace-time
strength of around 55,000 would be more than doubled on mobilisation from
Britain’s reserves (see p. 115). Virtually all the RAF’s combat and combat
support aircraft are now allocated to NATO. Royal Air Force Germany is a
tactical air force including strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and
air-defence aircraft. In addition, combat units based in the United Kingdom
provide an important part of NATO’s mobile reinforcement capability. These
include the ground elements of the United Kingdom Mobile Force, and the
British contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land).
RAF Strike Command provides forces for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close
support, air defence and maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, together

with transport forces and air elements for the United Kingdom Mobile Force
and Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Air).
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.
Britain continues to maintain forces in certain dependencies, such as Hong
Kong, Gibraltar, Belize, and the Falkland Islands and also at the sovereign
bases in Cyprus. The forces stationed in Malta are to be withdrawn by 1979.
In the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, occasional deployments of British
naval vessels will continue to be made. In Malaysia, British forces make a small
contribution to the integrated air defence system of the Five-Power defence
arrangements (see p. 109).
THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces consist of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the
Army and the Royal Air Force.
The Royal Navy has four main arms: the Naval General Service, which
mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who primarily provide an amphibious striking
force.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Guards division and divisions of infantry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the
Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Household Cavalry, the Corps of Royal
Engineers, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Corps of
Signals, the Royal Corps of Transport, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Army
Ordnance Corps and the Royal Army Education Corps.
The Royal Air Force is organised in commands, on a functional basis at
home and on a geographical basis overseas. These comprise Strike, Training
and Support Commands (which will merge in 1977) and Royal Air Force
Germany. The Royal Navy has a unified sea command, Commander-in-Chief,
Fleet; shore commands have been reorganised under a single Commander-in-
Chief, Naval Home Command, Portsmouth, with subordinate area commands
based at Plymouth, Chatham and Rosyth. At home the Army is under a single
command, United Kingdom Land Forces; overseas commands are British
Army of the Rhine, Near East Land Forces, Land Forces Hong Kong, and
British Forces Malta and Gibraltar.
The three women’s Services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAF), are integral parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve
alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing services are provided by
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal
Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Britain’s armed forces excluding non-United Kingdom personnel totalled
338,500 on 1st January 1976, 75,900 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines,
170,900 in the Army and 91,700 in the Royal Air Force. The forecast total for
1 st April 1977 is 327,000. Recruitment to the armed forces in 1975-76 totalled
46,900, an increase of 4>700 on tire previous year. The average number of
civilian staff expected to be employed by the Ministry of Defence during

Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to
22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
Recruits to non-commissioned ranks of all three Services are committed for
only a minimum period of productive service (about three years) and, subject
to that minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months notice. Discharge may
also be granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of
conscience (applications being assessed by an independent tribunal). Com¬
missions may be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services
there are opportunities for promotion from the ranks. Entry to commissioned

ranks is on the basis of educational and other qualifications (General Certificate
of Education O and A level and their equivalents or degrees): all three Services
have schemes for university cadetships which enable young men to take a
degree before commencing their training.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young service¬
men are encouraged to study for educational qualifications, all three Services
providing extensive facilities for the consolidation and development of their
personnel’s education. Trade and technical training, though primarily designed
for Service purposes, leads for about half the total number of servicemen to
nationally recognised qualifications including qualification for membership of
trade unions.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist such resettlement the Services
provide an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisa¬
tions and, for those without technical qualifications, opportunity and assistance
to study for suitable civilian qualifications. There are also opportunities for

short- and longer-term retraining both before and after discharge from the
Services.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the
Royal Air Force College, Cranwell or similar institutions. This is followed by
specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College at Latimer is designed to provide
mid-career officers with training for posts involving inter-Service staff work.
Specially selected and more senior officers from the Services, the Civil Service,
and from the Commonwealth, the United States, and allied European coun¬
tries attend the Royal College of Defence Studies (formerly the Imperial
Defence College) in London, which provides the wider background necessary
for senior posts in the direction of defence.
Considerable operational training is done through Joint-Service and inter¬
allied exercises. All three Services provide training facilities for the armed
forces of allied and Commonwealth countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided into the nuclear strategic force (costing
an estimated ^78 million in i97^_77)> Royal Navy general purpose combat
forces (£726 million), European theatre ground forces (£985 million), other
Army combat forces (£64 million) and Royal Air Force general purpose
forces (£906 million).
The British contribution to NATO’s strategic deterrent is provided by the
Royal Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—Resolution, Repulse,
Renown and Revenge. Each has indefinite underwater cruising range and is
equipped with 16 Polaris missiles with a range of about 2,800 miles (4,506 km)
and carrying thermonuclear warheads.
The naval general purpose combat forces comprise amphibious and naval air
forces, submarines (excluding the Polaris force), helicopter-cruisers, des¬
troyers, frigates, mine counter-measures forces and support and other ships.
The aircraft carrier Ark Royal operates Phantom and Buccaneer strike aircraft,
Gannet airborne early warning aircraft and Sea King anti-submarine heli¬
copters. Amphibious forces are provided by the assault ships Fearless and.
Intrepid (only one of which is operational at any time), while the anti-submarine
warfare carrier Hermes has a secondary role as a commando ship. The com-
mand-helicopter-cruisers Blake and Tiger also carry Sea King helicopters and
are responsible for directing and controlling naval forces. There are also
seven County class guided missile destroyers equipped with Seaslug and Seacat
surface-to-air missile systems; four of them have also been fitted with the
Exocet surface-to-surface guided missile system. The Type 82 guided missile
destroyer Bristol is equipped with the Seadart area air defence missile system
and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapon system. Sheffield, first of the
Type 42 Seadart destroyers, and four of the Amazon class Type 21 frigates
are in service, while another Type 42 destroyer will enter service in 1976. There
are also 26 Leander class and seven Tribal class general purpose frigates, two
anti-aircraft frigates, four aircraft-direction frigates, 15 anti-submarine
frigates, and the diesel frigate Mermaid. The frigate classes are variously
4
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
armed with automatic guns, surface-to-air missile systems, underwater
detection and anti-submarine weapons. Most carry the Wasp helicopter which
is to be replaced, where appropriate, by the Lynx. The balance of the fleet is
made up of the minesweeper and mine-hunter forces, patrol vessels, survey and
trials ships. Under construction is the Invincible, the first of a new class of anti¬
submarine cruiser, which will be equipped to operate Sea King helicopters and
will have the additional capability of operating maritime vertical-short-take-
off-and-landing (V/STOL) aircraft. In addition six of the new Type 42
Seadart destroyers and three of the Type 21 frigates are being built. The first
of a new class of frigate. Type 22, to be armed with the Seazcolf surface-to-air
missile system, is under construction, with a second on order and work is in
hand on a new class of mine countermeasures vessel in glass-reinforced plastics.
Besides the four Polaris submarines (see above) there are eight nuclear-
powered fleet submarines in service with a ninth due to enter service in i97^»
together with 19 conventional patrol submarines. A further two nuclear sub¬
marines are under construction. Tankers and store ships of the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary Service provide worldwide logistic support afloat.
European The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR, and the forces
Theatre Ground stationed in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support
Forces of NATO (see p. no).
Other Army Other Army combat forces comprise land forces stationed abroad to meet
Combat Forces treaty commitments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p. 109).
Equipment
Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank and the
Swingfire long-range anti-tank guided missile. A new series of tracked combat
reconnaissance vehicles are in service: the Scorpion and the Scimitar, mounting
respectively a 76-mm and a 30-mm gun, which will shortly be joined by the
Striker, carrying the Szcingfire anti-tank missile. The primary tracked armoured
personnel carriers used by mechanised infantry battalions are the FV 432> some
of which are fitted with 81-mm mortars or Wombat 120-mm anti-tank guns.
Artillery units are equipped with the Abbot 105-mm gun, 155-mm and 175-mm
self-propelled guns, and Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE).
Tactical nuclear support is provided by the Lance missile system (replacing
the Honest John) and the 203-mm self-propelled howitzer.
Air defence is provided by the Rapier low-level surface-to-air missile system
(replacing the Thunderbird mobile surface-to-air missile) and the L40/70 gun.
Royal Air Force
General
Purpose
Forces
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
strike/attack, reconnaissance, offensive support and tactical reconnaissance,
maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling,
together with RAF Regiment field squadrons.
Equipment Lightning and Phantom FGi and FGR2 aircraft, together with Bloodhound,
Tigercat and Rapier surface-to-air missiles, are employed in air defence.
Reporting and control are provided by the computerised Linesman system,
and a number of Shackletons have been converted to provide airborne early
warning over the sea. Jaguars, Vulcans and Buccaneers operate in the strike/
attack role. The primary role of some of the strike/attack and air defence
aircraft is the shore-based protection of naval forces at sea. I ulcans, Canberras
and Phantom FGR2S are employed in the reconnaissance role; Harrier

V/STOL aircraft and Jaguars for offensive support (the Harrier also having a
tactical reconnaissance capability); and Nimrods in maritime patrol and anti¬
submarine warfare. With the introduction of the Jaguar in the strike/attack,
reconnaissance and offensive support roles which began in 1974, the Phantom
FGRas are being gradually transferred to air defence, where they will largely
replace the Lightnings.
Strategic transport support is provided by VC10 aircraft. The Hercules, which
also has a strategic capability, is used for tactical transport support over
medium ranges. For short-range tasks the Wessex and Puma helicopters are
available. A force of Victor tanker aircraft provides in-flight refuelling which
gives added range and flexibility to operations of air defence, maritime strike
and other aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve); others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency. On
1st January 1976 regular reserves totalled 168,600 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 68,700. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to
recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 130,000.
The Royal Navy regular reserve consists of various categories of former full¬
time officers and ratings liable to recall in emergency, including the Royal Fleet
Reserve of men with recent experience of regular service. The volunteer
reserves comprise the Royal Naval Reserve, with its associated women’s
reserve, and the Royal Marines Reserve. Both carry out regular part-time
training, the former to man a number of operational minesweepers and support
maritime and other headquarters, the latter to reinforce the regular corps and
in particular the Royal Marine Commandos.
The Army reserves comprise ex-regular servicemen (organised as the Regular
Army Reserve of Officers, the Regular Reserve, the Long Term Reserve and the
Army Pensioners) and the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).
The TAVR’s primary role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support
of the forces deployed in Europe. It consists of independent units, organised
on a local basis with regular Army and permanent civilian staff, and sponsored
units of specialists recruited on a country-wide basis. They are liable for call¬
up in an emergency. There are also a number of miscellaneous units (including
university officer-training corps) and pools of individuals (known as Group B)
which have a variety of functions.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally recruited, part-time force designed
to support the regular forces in their security tasks in Northern Ireland.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of former regular officers and personnel
with a reserve liability, and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the university air squadrons. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists
of maritime headquarter units which would support regular formations in an
emergency.

CIVIL DEFENCE
Research
and
Development
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, local
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national
appeal in time of crisis. A central point of recent policy has been to improve the
preparedness of local government to meet a war emergency; there is much
common ground between such planning and the preparations and organisation
for a major peace-time emergency or national disaster. Activities have therefore
also been directed towards creating a closer relationship in local planning for
the different emergencies of peace and war.
Within an annual budget of £14-5 million emphasis is placed on a high
standard of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are
arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, including the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and strength of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive was set up in 1971 following a reorganisa¬
tion of the departments responsible for defence and civil aerospace, the purpose
of which was the establishment of a closer liaison between the Service users
and the machinery for procurement, closer co-ordination with industry in the
formulation of programmes, and stronger and more accountable management,
so ensuring a co-ordinated and cost-effective approach.
The major part of research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence s research
and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. The research and develop¬
ment establishments have a very wide technological capability, which has
civil as well as military applications: for example, support is given to civil
aerospace projects such as Concorde and advanced aero-engines. On the
development side, the establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry s
contractors by monitoring their progress, and by assisting in testing programmes
and in solving particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its develop¬
ment requires a high initial investment; in 1976—77 the total cost of British
equipment research and development is estimated at £702 million. The
search for a more efficient use of these resources has caused attention to be
concentrated on collaborative projects, which enable the cost of development
and production to be shared with other countries. On occasions, the outright
purchase of foreign equipment is the most economical solution. Nevertheless,
the importance of maintaining a sound national industrial base for defence
procurement is recognised, and there is close consultation between government
and industry both in the National Defence Industries Council and through
other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and European countries is already extensive,
DEFENCE
“7
and may be expected to increase, particularly through the work of the Euro¬
group. The most important single project is the Tornado multi-role combat
aircraft being developed by Britain, Italy and the Federal Republic of
Germany; agreement on its production was’reached in July 1976. A number
of Anglo-French projects—the Jaguar aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface
missile, the Puma, Gazelle and Lynx helicopters—are now in service. Britain,
the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy are collaborating in the develop¬
ment of 155-mm towed and self-propelled howitzers, while Britain and the
Federal Republic are studying the possible collaborative development of a
future main battle tank. Britain and Belgium are partners in a programme for
the development and production of a family of tracked combat reconnaissance
vehicles.
Britain has also co-operated with Australia on the Ikara anti-submarine
equipment.
Equipment collaboration also facilitates joint logistic support and training
arrangements, like those being discussed between Britain and four other
European countries which have agreed to purchase the Lance surface-to-
surface missile system from the United States.
National Projects A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include the Hawk jet trainer, the Rapier low-level
surface-to-air guided weapon system, the Sea Wolf short-range surface-to-air
guided missile, navigation and attack systems for aircraft, radar, sonar and
communications systems, the anti-submarine cruiser, a new range of logistic
vehicles for battlefield support, a new type of tank armour, Chobham Armour,
giving a high level of protection against all forms of attack, including guided
weapons and the Wisp and Wideye remotely piloted helicopters.
Production Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence
Sales organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry
and the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment
overseas. In 1976-77 the value of exports of British defence equipment is
expected to reach £700 million.
6 Social Welfare
Voluntary
Organisations
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
Central and local government are responsible for a wide range of health and
social services. Central government is responsible directly for social security and
the National Health Service which is administered by health authorities and
boards acting as its agents. It has an indirect responsibility for many local
authority services. Local authorities are directly responsible for education (see
Chapter 7), housing (see Chapter 9) and personal social services (described in
this chapter). They also have responsibility for environmental health. Public
expenditure on health and personal social services is given on pp. 349-50.
The State services are complemented by those provided by voluntary
organisations and by individual volunteers. Voluntary organisations, especially
the churches, pioneered the development of the social services by providing
schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries and social and recreational clubs. How¬
ever, these facilities were not uniformly spread throughout the country and
did not cover everyone in need. Gradually the State accepted responsibility for
the major services by developing a comprehensive structure to ensure a mini¬
mum standard of living and well-being for the population.
State and voluntary social services work in co-operation. Both central and
local government make grants to the voluntary agencies. Public authorities plan
and carry out their duties taking account of the work of voluntary organisations
which often specialise by meeting particular needs. Both local authorities
and voluntary agencies provide residential care for elderly, disabled, mentally
ill and mentally handicapped people and for children.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service is the
responsibility of the Home Office in England and Wales, the Scottish Office in
Scotland and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern
Ireland. The Volunteer Centre, a national centre for information and research
on voluntary work, was established in 1973 w^h the aid of a government grant.
About 130 volunteer bureaux have been established to give advice locally.
In England and Wales the Charity Commission, a Government agency, gives
free advice to trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or
facilitate their administration when necessary. It maintains central and local
registers of charities which are open to public inspection, and it investigates and
checks abuses, though it has no power to act in the administration of a charity.
The number of voluntary organisations in Britain runs into thousands, they
range from national organisations to small individual local groups. Most
organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented on
local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly con¬
cerned with giving personal service, others in the formation of public opinion
and exchange of information. Some carry out both these functions.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association, Family
Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
SOCIAL WELFARE
119
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisa¬
tions; the National Council for One-Parent Families; and the Samaritans, who
help people who are near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
the Young Volunteer Force Foundation, Community Service Volunteers, Task
Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school groups.
■* Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by—among
others—the British Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Women’s
Royal Voluntary Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends, but a number of
societies exist to help people with particular disabilities and difficulties. Such
societies, some of which are constituent members of the Central Council for the
Disabled, include the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf, MIND (National Association for Mental Health), the
National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their equivalents
in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Com¬
mittee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the Young
Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the
Society of Friends, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with
family problems and assists in hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work
in emergencies.
The main voluntary body in England which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned with social
service is the National Council of Social Service, which brings together most of
the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a
whole or in groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth
work. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service, the Council for
Social Service for Wales and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service,
which perform similar functions. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which
there are nearly 700, give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt
about his rights or who does not know about the State or voluntary services
which could help him. There are law centres and housing advisory centres in
some areas.
URBAN PROGRAMMES
An urban programme providing for government-aided local authority
expenditure was launched in 1968 to assist areas of special social need, in par¬
ticular to relieve problems resulting from overcrowding, inadequate housing
and schools and other forms of deprivation. Total expenditure for the period
1968-69 to 1975-76 was about £79 million. Projects approved include advice
and information centres, community centres, help for the homeless, literacy
schemes, play centres, projects of special help to ethnic minorities, summer
holiday schemes for deprived children and schemes to assist maltreated women
(‘battered wives’). Many projects are run by voluntary organisations.
120
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An experiment in community development is also being undertaken by the
Government in association with certain local authorities and universities in
selected small areas mainly situated in declining inner city districts. Local pro¬
jects comprise action and research teams who analyse the needs of their areas,
promote experimental programmes and make recommendations for changes in
policy and administration where appropriate. The experiment is expected to
end in March 1978.
Under the European Community anti-poverty programme, seven pilot
projects are being set up in Britain.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances, family
income supplement, supplementary benefits, and war pensions constitute a
comprehensive system of social security.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services in
Great Britain; within the department, the Supplementary Benefits Commission
is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland
the first five of these schemes are administered by the Department of Health
and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits Commission
for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their
dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social
Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims for the
various benefits are decided by tribunals.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (one major early statute was the 1601
Poor Relief Act in England and Wales), the modern social security system is a
creation of the twentieth century. In 1908 non-contributory old age pensions
were introduced and the first contributory pensions for old people, widows and
orphans came in 1926. A contributory scheme of health and unemployment in¬
surance was passed by Parliament in 1911, unemployment insurance being
extended in 1920 to cover the great majority of employees. Although Britain’s
social security provision was among the best in the world by the beginning of
the second world war, it lacked co-ordination because of its piecemeal develop¬
ment and not everyone came within its scope.
In the immediate postwar years a series of Acts established the main features
of a comprehensive social security system which became operative (together
with a National Health Service) in July 1948. In 1961 an earnings-related
supplement to retirement pension was started, based on graduated contribu¬
tions, and this principle was extended in 1966 to unemployment and sickness
benefit; in April 1975 the supplement became payable with maternity allow¬
ance. In the 1970s new benefits have included pensions for widows aged
betweeen 40 and 50 when widowed or when entitlement to widowed mother’s
allowance ends, and old persons’ pensions payable to persons aged 80 and
over who have not qualified for a national insurance retirement pension.
Increased provision has been made for sick and disabled people; in 1971
an invalidity pension was introduced for those who had received sickness
benefit for 28 weeks with an additional invalidity allowance for people becoming
sick more than five years before retirement age. This was followed by attendance
allowances for very severely disabled people. Further benefits became payable
in 1975 and 1976 to help disabled people and those caring for them. Statutory
provision for the war disabled goes back to the end of the sixteenth century,
but the main lines of the present war pensions scheme were laid down during

the first world war with further developments during and after the second
world war.
The Social Security Pensions Act 1975 introduces, from April 1978, a new
State pension scheme under which retirement, invalidity and widows’ pensions
will be earnings-related and fully protected against inflation. The new pension
will have two parts—basic pension (equivalent to the present flat rate pension) and
an additional pension. Rights to additional pension will build up year by year
over a 20-year maturity period, finally reaching 25 per cent of a person’s earn¬
ings between a lower earnings limit (equivalent to the basic pension) and an
upper earnings limit of seven times that amount. Women will receive equal
benefits as men with the same earnings and rights to basic pension will be
safeguarded during years of home responsibility. A married man with average
earnings will qualify for a combined pension for himself and his wife worth
more than half his pay. Employers providing occupational pension schemes
will be able to contract their employees out of part of the State scheme and
pay a lower contribution to it. Pension rights earned under the former
graduated scheme will be protected against inflation for the first time. The
same provisions will apply to Northern Ireland under the Social Security
Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1975.
Family allowances and social security benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment, sickness, invalidity, injury or disablement benefit,
are included in the taxable income on which income tax is assessed. On the other
hand various income tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or
liability for the support of dependants. Family income supplement, attendance
allowances and war disablement pensions are not taxable.
There are three kinds of social security benefit: those paid in return for contri¬
butions to the social security scheme (for example, retirement pension, sickness
and unemployment benefit, maternity benefits, widows’ benefits and industrial
injuries benefits); non-contributory benefits paid to certain groups of people
regardless of income (for example, family allowances, attendance allowances
and old persons’ pensions); and supplementary benefit (also non-contributory)
for people not in full-time work with incomes below specified levels. Family
income supplement is payable to low wage earners with children to support.
The Social Security Acts apply, in general, to everyone over the age of 16 living
in Britain. There are similar schemes in the Isle of Man.
The national insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
by contributions from individuals, by contributions of employers in respect
of their employees, and by a contribution made by the Treasury.
There are four classes of national insurance contribution. Class 1 is paid by
employed people, Classes 2 and 4 by self-employed people and Class 3 by
voluntary contributors. The Class 1 contribution (which includes a small con¬
tribution towards the cost of the National Health Service) is earnings-related
and amounts to 5-75 per cent of earnings up to ^95 per week provided that
these are at least £13 per week. The employer’s contribution per employee is
875 per cent over the same earnings range. Married women and most widows (if
employed) can pay full contributions or may opt to pay 2 per cent. If they pay
the lower contribution they rely on their husband’s (or late husband’s) insur¬
ance for maternity grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate), and death
grant; the right to choose paying lower contributions is to be phased out
122
Benefits

gradually from April 1977. The contributions are deducted at source through
the ‘Pay As You Earn’ income tax system.
The self-employed pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of ^2-41 a week (£2-20
for women) and in addition, may have to pay a Class 4 contribution amounting
to 8 per cent of net profits or gains between £1,600 and £4,900 a year. Self-
employed married women and widows must pay any Class 4 contribution due
but they have a choice whether or not to pay a Class 2 contribution.

There is also a Class 3 flat-rate contribution of £2-10 paid voluntarily by
employed earners or others who wish to safeguard entitlement to retirement
pension and some other benefits. Class 2 and Class 3 contributions are paid by
means of stamps bought from a post office which are affixed to a national in¬
surance contribution card or by direct debit of a bank or National Giro account.
Certain people do not have to pay contributions. In general an employed
person ceases to be liable for contributions at the age of 70 for a man and 65 for a
woman, or when he or she retires after reaching pensionable age (65 for a man
and 60 for a woman). The employer, however, remains liable for contributions
when the employee’s earnings reach the lower earnings limit of £13. Self-
employed people with earnings below £775 a year do not have to pay Class 2
contributions.
The graduated pension scheme initiated in April 1961 ended in April 1975
but entitlement to pension on the basis of contributions paid remains.
Class 1 contributions cover the employee for retirement pension, unemploy¬
ment and sickness benefit, invalidity benefit, widow’s benefits, maternity
benefits, death grant, child’s special allowance and industrial injury and dis¬
ablement benefit. All these benefits with the exception of unemployment, in¬
dustrial injury and disablement benefits are also covered by Class 2 contribu¬
tions paid by self-employed people. Class 3 contributors may receive retirement
pension, widow’s benefits, maternity grant, death grant and child’s special
allowance.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, certain contributions must actually have been paid
since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid
unless contributions have been paid or credited up to a specific level over a
specified period. There are special rules to help a widow who does not become
entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her children have grown
up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit in the period before she
can have established or re-established herself in insurance through her own
contributions; there are also provisions to help a divorced woman who was
not paying contributions during her marriage. The main national insurance
benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates quoted are those
effective from November 1976.

Retirement pension is ^15*3° f°r a single insured person and ^24*50 for a
married couple,'payable to men over the age of 65 and women over 60 when they
cease working full-time. The pension is paid to men over 70 and women over 65
even if they continue to work. Retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for
women) have their pensions reduced in step with their earnings over specified
amounts. An age addition of 25P is paid to pensioners over the age of 80. An
earnings-related graduated pension is payable to people who contributed to the
graduated pension scheme between 1961 and 1975. The maximum payable is
£2.10 for men and £175 for women.
Unemployment or sickness benefit is £12-90 plus £8 for an adult dependant
and £4‘°5 f°r each child inclusive of family allowances (see p. 125). Married
women under 60 who pay full contributions receive £9-20. Unemployment
benefit is payable for up to a year in any one spell of unemployment (spells
which are 13 weeks or less apart count as one spell) and sickness benefit is
payable for 28 weeks. Earnings-related supplement (up to a maximum of
£12-18 from January 197?) calculated on reckonable weekly earnings in the
relevant income tax year but it, together with the flat rate benefits, cannot
exceed 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings on which the supplement is
based. The supplement is payable for a maximum of six months from the 13th
day of a period of interruption of employment.
Invalidity pension is £15-30 plus £9-20 for a wife and £7-45 for a child inclusive
of family allowances and is payable when sickness benefit ends if the bene¬
ficiary is still incapable of work. An invalidity allowance (ranging from £1 to
£3-20 according to age) is paid with the pension to those people who become
sick more than five years before retirement age.
Widow’s allowance is £21-40 plus £7-45 for each child inclusive of family
allowances. It is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood and there may be
an earnings-related addition calculated on the husband’s reckonable earnings in
the relevant tax year.
Widowed mother’s allowance is £15-30 plus £7-45 for each child inclusive of
family allowances, payable when widow’s allowance ends if the widow has
dependent children.
Widow’s pension is £15-30 if the widow is over the age of 50 when her husband
dies or when widowed mother’s allowance ends. It reduces on a scale to £4-59
for widows aged 40 at that time. This continues until the widow has reached
pensionable age and retires provided that she does not remarry before that age.
On retirement she receives a pension not lower than her widow’s pension. All
widows’ benefits are payable regardless of a widow’s earnings.
Maternity grant is £25 for each living child born.
Maternity allowance is £12-90 payable normally for 18 weeks (11 weeks before
the expected week of confinement and 6 weeks after this or the actual confine¬
ment). The allowance is payable only to working women who have paid full
Class 1 or Class 2 national insurance contributions. An earnings-related supple¬
ment may be payable in addition.
A maximum of £30 is payable on death. Less is payable for a child.

Child’s special allowance is £7-45 inclusive of family allowances. It is payable
to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who has not
re-married, if her former husband dies and if she has a child to whose support
he was contributing before he died.
The industrial injuries insurance scheme provides benefits (from the national
insurance fund) for personal injuries caused by accidents arising from employ¬
ment and for prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers
practically everyone liable to pay Class 1 contributions and certain others.
Injury benefit for an adult is £15-65 a week plus £8 for an adult dependant
and ^4-05 for each child inclusive of family allowances. It is paid when the
insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or
prescribed disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks
beginning on the date of the accident or development of the disease. A person
entitled to sickness benefit who draws injury benefit instead, also receives any
earnings-related supplement (see p. 123) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss of
physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the disable¬
ment as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £25 a week for 100 per cent
disablement to £5 for 20 per cent disablement, but for disablement of less than
20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement at the weekly rate of £15'3°5 constant
attendance allowance of up to fiio weekly normally, or a special rate of
£15 or £20 a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of fiio a
week for exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance of up
to 1 o for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or to do work of an
equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which raises the benefit
to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the industrial
disability. Increases of disablement benefit for dependants are payable with
unemployability supplement. People receiving unemployability supplement
may also receive an additional allowance similar to invalidity allowance.
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit may
be paid to his or her dependants.
For a widow a pension of ^21*4° a week is payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-telated supplement that
would have been paid had she claimed widow s allowance under the main
national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive a pension of
^15‘85 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband s death, or has
dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives ^4*59 a week.
If she had been living apart from her husband, a pension is payable only if she
was receiving or entitled to receive at least ^0*25 a week for her maintenance
from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows they are fi'JAS f°r each child inclusive of family
allowances. Other beneficiaries receive ^4*05.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be en¬
titled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.

Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 and in Northern Ireland by separate legislation. They are paid in
Great Britain to about 4-4 million families and in Northern Ireland to some
142,000 families. The rate of the allowance is ^1-50 for each child in a family
other than the first. They are payable to families with two or more children who
are under minimum school-leaving age (or under 19 and either in full-time
education or apprentices with low earnings).
Allowances are paid from the Treasury and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they may be drawn by the wife or husband but they belong in
law to the wife who must claim them. Although the allowances are non-con¬
tributory, there are certain residence conditions.
In April, family allowances will be replaced by a child benefit payable to the
mother for all children in a family; it will be £1 for the first child and £1-50 for
every other child in the family. Benefit for the first child of one-parent families
is £1-50. Income tax allowances for children will be phased out.
Guardian’s allowance is a weekly benefit of ^7-45 payable to a person who has
in his or her family a child who has lost both parents, one of whom must have
been born a British subject in Britain or the Isle of Man or must have satisfied
certain residence conditions.
A pension of £5‘6o for a married woman and £<)’20 for any other person (in¬
cluding an age addition of £o'2^) is payable (subject to conditions of residence
in Britain) to people over 80 years old who were excluded from the national in¬
surance scheme when it started or who failed to qualify for a retirement pension
or qualified for one at a lower rate.
An attendance allowance of £12-20 is paid to severely disabled people requiring
a great deal of attention by day and at night. A lower rate of £8-15 may be paid
to those who need help either by day or at night. A non-contributory invalidity
pension of £9'2o is payable to people of working age unable to work and not
qualifying for the national insurance invalidity pension; this will be extended
in November 1977 to disabled housewives who are incapable of work and
unable to perform their normal household tasks.
In July 1976 a weekly invalid care allowance of £9-20 became payable to
people who cannot go out to work because they are caring for a severely disabled
relative receiving an attendance allowance. In addition the Government is
introducing (over a three-year period from 1976) a mobility allowance of £5 a
week for severely disabled people (aged between five and pension age) who are
unable, or virtually unable, to walk and are likely to remain so for at least 12
months. The allowance aims to assist all such severely disabled people in their
transport costs, d his is unlike the previous system when mobility help
depended on the use of a motorised vehicle.
The Supplementary Benefit Act 1966 provides for a scheme of supplementary
benefits which is administered by a Supplementary Benefits Commission within
the Department of Health and Social Security. There is a similar commission in
Northern Ireland.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are in¬
sufficient to meet his requirements, as laid down by Parliament, is entitled to
supplementary benefit. In Northern Ireland a residence condition must also be

satisfied. The benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people
under the minimum retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those
over. The benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his
available resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calcu¬
lation of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and
family groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each
case, an addition for rent. For the old and certain other long-term cases a higher
long-term scale rate is payable. Additions are payable for special dietary or
heating requirements. A single payment of benefit may be made to meet an
exceptional need. A claimant’s available resources include both income, subject
to some modifications, and capital (though a certain amount is disregarded);
the main national insurance and industrial injuries benefits, family allowances,
family income supplement and maintenance payments from a husband or the
father of the claimant’s children are taken into account in full.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
person of working age may be conditional on registering for employment at
a local office of the Employment Service Agency.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. In Great Britain the
commission provides temporary accommodation for them in 23 reception
centres, two of which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the
commission. For men who have been unemployed for long periods and who are
receiving supplementary allowances, it runs 16 re-establishment centres,
three of which have residential accommodation, where they are given help to
fit them again for work.
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families (including single
parents) with small incomes where the head of the family is in full-time
work and there is at least one dependent child. It is payable when the gross
weekly income of a family falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at ^39 a
week where there is one child plus ^4*5° ^or eac^ additional child. The weekly
rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family s income and
the prescribed amount up to a maximum of for a one-child family and this
is increased by j^o^o for each additional child.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through war or service
in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal Warrants and
other instruments administered by the Department of Health and Social
Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
^25 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of dis¬
ablement. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (^16*30 a week), constant attendance (up to ^10
and, exceptionally, £20 a week), comforts (^2*15 or X4*3° a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to 3^10 a week). An additional allowance of
or £10 according to the severity of the disablement is payable to war
pensioners who are receiving constant attendance allowance at a rate above the
normal maximum. An age allowance (between j£i-8o and ^5‘5° a week) is pay¬
able to disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is
40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate of
pension for widows of private soldiers is £19-80 a week, with additional allow-

ances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to a
week). There is an additional allowance of ^1-95 for widows aged 65 which is
increased to ^3'9° age °f 7°* Parents or other relatives who were depen¬
dent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may receive
pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners, war widows and war orphans which is available to help any
who require advice or assistance.
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The department’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these and
statutory bodies.
The European Community Regulations on social security, framed to protect
the benefit rights of people moving within the Community, apply to employed
workers (and to pensioners who were employed workers) who are nationals
of any of the Community countries. People covered by these regulations
are entitled to benefit under the social security arrangements of any Com¬
munity country, and Gibraltar, where they are working or visiting, on
the same basis as nationals of that country. There are also bilateral reciprocal
agreements between the United Kingdom and individual member states of the
European Community which apply to self-employed and non-employed
people who are outside the scope of the European Community Regulations.
Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family allowances and most
national insurance benefits are in operation with Austria, Finland, Jersey
and Guernsey, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. Agree¬
ments with Cyprus, Israel, Malta, and Turkey cover industrial injuries and
most national insurance benefits. With Australia and New Zealand there are
agreements on family allowances and most national insurance benefits. There
are limited agreements with Bermuda, Canada, Jamaica and the United States.
The Isle of Man is party to most of the bilateral agreements with other countries
and Jersey and Guernsey to a few; neither the nationals of these areas nor their
social security schemes are covered by European Community Regulations. The
social security and family allowance schemes of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland operate as a single system.
In addition to payments provided under the social security legislation, there are
a number of other benefits for which people with low incomes may be eligible.
These include legal aid and assistance (see p. 105), rent rebates and allowances
(see p. 180), rate rebates (see p. 69), exemption from health service charges (see
p. 130) and free school meals (see p. 147).
HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of the
years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half of the
nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental or public
health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal of refuse and
cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century for the develop¬
ment of publicly provided personal health services culminating in the introduc¬
tion in 1948 of a comprehensive National Health Service available to residents
and to visitors taken ill or meeting with an accident while in Britain. Reciprocal
health agreements have been made with some other countries (see p. 135).
128
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Scientific discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the
development of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 70 years,
particularly in maternity and child health, school health services and school
meals, are reflected in declining mortality rates and improved physique. The
infant mortality rate has almost halved since the National Health Service
was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among the lowest in the
world. The health of children has steadily improved, and deaths from such
diseases as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diphtheria have fallen so markedly
that they are no longer major health problems. As part of the general growth of
facilities under the National Health Service, staffing has improved markedly.
Since 1965, for example, the hospital medical staff in England, Wales and
Scotland has increased by nearly 50 per cent and the nursing staff by over 40
per cent. The numbers of home nurses and health visitors have also increased
by nearly 50 per cent and about 30 per cent respectively.
Although major advances have been made in the provision of health facilities,
certain problems remain, notably regional disparities in health provision and a
shortage of resources resulting from the need to restrain the growth in public
expenditure. An additional problem is the high cost of technologically advanced
equipment required for diagnosis and treatment. To help alleviate some of these
difficulties the Government is allocating more funds to the less-favoured
regions at the expense of those which have the best provision. Greater emphasis
is being placed on preventive services and on the development of primary health
care—the services provided by family doctors, dentists and ophthalmic practi¬
tioners, supplemented by the work of home nurses, midwives and health
visitors. Cuts in capital expenditure are being made but reductions will not
take place in services to patients. A continued rise in standards in general
practice is expected as a result of increased vocational training schemes for
family doctors, a development favoured by the medical profession.
A Royal Commission is considering the best use and management of the
financial and manpower resources for the National Health Service.
HEALTH SERVICE The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services in England
ADMINISTRATION anci the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—are
responsible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries.
The organisation responsible for administering these health services is three-
tier in England and two-tier in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Within
each of the four countries the health departments (the Department of Health
and Social Security in England, the Scottish Home and Health Department,
the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern
Ireland) are responsible for strategic planning. Area health authorities in
England and Wales, health boards in Scotland and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland are responsible for area planning and operational
control of all health services in their area. In England only, because of its greater
size and population, there is an additional tier of regional authorities responsible
for regional planning and certain services best administered on a regional basis
(for example, research and major capital building work).
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales and 15 health boards in Scotland.
They are all statutory agencies of central government and co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social work, environmental health, educa¬
tion and other services. In general the areas covered by area health authorities
and health boards correspond with those of the major local authorities. Health
and local authorities in England and Wales have a duty to co-operate in order
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
to secure the best provision of services. This is done through joint planning
arrangements and joint consultative committees.
In Northern Ireland the four health and social services boards act as agents
for the Department of Health and Social Services.
Area authorities and health boards in Great Britain have discretion to deter¬
mine the pattern of services best suited to their area but they have to take
account of national priorities. In most areas the day-to-day running of services
is carried out by management teams in districts which usually contain a district
general hospital and have a population of between 150,000 and 300,000, though
some are considerably larger (in Scotland they may be much smaller in the
remoter areas). In Scotland a Common Services Agency organises those
services that can be provided most efficiently by one agency. A Central Services
Agency performs similar functions in Northern Ireland.
The health authorities and boards consist of unpaid part-time members. The
chairmen and members of the regional authorities and health boards, and the
chairmen of the area health authorities are appointed by the health minister con¬
cerned after consultation with professional, local authority, university and other
interests. Two-thirds of the members of the area health authorities are appointed
by the regional health authorities in England and the health ministers in Wales;
these include at least one university nominee and some professional members
who work within the service. The remainder are appointed by the correspond¬
ing local authorities. Area authorities in areas containing a teaching hospital
are known as area authorities (teaching) and in addition to two university
nominees contain at least two members with teaching hospital experience. In
Scotland all board members are appointed by the health minister.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the health ministers
but it is their responsibility to provide hospital clinical facilities for the training
of medical students. The universities are responsible for teaching.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees and the
authorities have a duty to consult with these committees. The main national
advisory bodies are the Central Health Services Council in England and Wales,
the Scottish Health Service Planning Council in Scotland and the Health and
Social Services Council in Northern Ireland. The Health Advisory Service for
England and Wales reports to the Secretaries of State on conditions in hospitals
and the community health service.
The Scottish Hospital Advisory Service reports to health boards and the
Secretary of State.
Public representation in the service for England and Wales is provided by
district community health councils. These consist of about 20 to 30 members,
half of them appointed by local government councils and the rest mainly on the
nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health services. They have
access to the area health authority, the right to secure information and the right
to visit hospitals in this capacity.
In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health boards to
represent the interests of the public. District committees exercise this function
in Northern Ireland.
Health Service The three Health Service Commissioners (for England, for Scotland and for
Commissioners Wales) are statutory independent officers whose function is to investigate com¬
plaints from members of the public that they have suffered injustice or hardship
as a result of failure in a service provided by a health authority, or failure to
provide a service which it was its duty to provide, or maladministration. Health

authorities include regional health authorities, area health authorities, boards of
governors and family practitioner committees. Before a commissioner can
investigate, the complaint must have been brought to the attention of the
authority concerned, and an adequate opportunity given for it to investigate
and reply. Matters which are outside his jurisdiction include action taken solely
in the exercise of clinical judgment and the action of general practitioners and
dentists in connection with medical and dental services; these, however, may
be investigated under a separate procedure.
The commissioners report annually to the respective Secretaries of State who
lay the reports before each House of Parliament. The terms of reference of the
Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
(see p. 38), who also holds the three posts of Health Service Commissioner,
have been expanded to cover these reports.
In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints (see p. 70) investi¬
gates complaints concerning the health service, but not the actions of medical
practitioners or other professions supplementary to medicine.
Public expenditure on the health services in Great Britain was about £5,458
million in 1975-76. Most of the cost falls on the Treasury while the rest is met
from the national health service contribution paid with the national insurance
contribution and charges paid by people using certain services. There are
charges for medical prescriptions (except for children under 16 years, expectant
and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over,
patients suffering from certain medical conditions, war and Service disablement
pensioners, and families with very low incomes, including those receiving
supplementary benefits and family income supplement); for treatment in the
general dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to
people under 21 years or women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the
past year); for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school, and
women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the past year); for spectacles
(except children’s standard spectacles); and for certain other articles. Certain
low income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges (those receiving
supplementary benefit or family income supplement and those receiving free
prescriptions or welfare foods). A limited amount of accommodation may be
made available for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided that it is not
needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients; a charge for part of the
cost of the accommodation is made. Provision is also made at certain hospitals
for patients to be treated as private patients on payment of the whole cost of
their accommodation and treatment. The Government is, however, planning to
phase out private pay beds in National Health Service hospitals.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in the National Health Service
are paid according to the number of patients on their list with adjustments to
reflect differences in work and responsibility; certain practice expenses are also
directly reimbursed.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight test
made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and
type of pairs supplied.

Primary health care, the front line of the personal health services, is in the
hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists working within the service
as independent practitioners, and home nurses, midwives and health visitors
employed by the health authorities.
The family practitioner services cover the services given to individuals by
doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. They are
administered by family practitioner committees established by the health
authorities and boards. In Northern Ireland the family practitioner services are
administered by the Central Services Agency.
Some 24,500 general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in
Great Britain take some part in the service. The maximum number of patients’
names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average
number in Great Britain is about 2,400. In Northern Ireland there are some 740
general practitioners with about 2,100 patients each. Access to most other
parts of the health service is obtained through the family doctor.
There are over 13,200 dentists taking part in the health service.
Some 1,000 ophthalmic medical practitioners and about 6,500 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians are engaged in the general ophthalmic services which
provide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are about 13,000 retail establishments under contract to the National
Health Service with responsibility for the dispensing of all prescriptions
except for the small number dispensed by certain general medical practitioners
and hospital pharmacies.
Health authorities are under a duty to provide home nurses, midwives and
health visitors, to meet the demand of patients. Home nurses attend to people
needing nursing in their homes or elsewhere outside hospitals. Midwives assist
the family doctor at home confinements (about 6 per cent of all confinements),
and care for mothers and babies (whether born at home or in hospital) for about
10 days after the birth. Health visitors are concerned with the health of the
household as a whole, and have an important part to play in health education
and preventive measures. They work in close co-operation with general medical
practitioners, the paediatric and geriatric wards of hospitals and social workers.
Increasingly family doctors work as members of co-ordinated primary health
care teams. About three-quarters of them are in partnership or group practices,
and it is becoming more common for home nurses, midwives and health visitors
to work from the larger premises established for such practices. Nearly a fifth
of the doctors work in 830 health centres which are built and maintained by
the health authorities and which provide modern and well-equipped accommo¬
dation for primary health care teams consisting of general practitioners and
home nurses, midwives and health visitors. Additional services which may be
provided at health centres include dentistry, chiropody, family planning, ante¬
natal care, health education and sessions for children. Occasionally, when
necessary, provision is made for general ophthalmic services. In some cases, a
social worker is attached to or co-operates with the primary health care team.
Out-patient facilities for local hospitals may also be provided.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic facili¬
ties for in-patients, day-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity depart-
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
merits, infectious disease units, psychiatric and geriatric facilities, rehabilitation
facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of specialised treatment. A number
of specialist hospitals for mentally ill and mentally handicapped people are
also provided. In the long term the Government plans to replace the majority of
mental illness hospitals by facilities based on psychiatric units in district general
hospitals. Mentally handicapped people are cared for in hospital and in the
community; it is long-term government policy to shift the emphasis from
hospital to community care but, where hospital treatment is required, it will be
provided in small units near to the patient’s own home.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in
the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and a number of new
hospitals have been built.
There are nearly 2,770 NHS hospitals in Britain; they have some 498,000
beds and a nursing and midwifery staff of 258,000 full-time and about 170,000
part-time. There are 36,770 medical staff including over 13,600 consultants.
Rehabilitation Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today treatment is not
limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions but aims at helping
people to resume normal living as soon as possible. Rehabilitation has been
applied with advantage in the care of many patients, including the younger
disabled, the mentally ill and the aged and has enabled many patients to
become self-sufficient and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
Rehabilitation facilities are provided in the majority of hospitals and at special
centres. The work is carried out by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, remedial
gymnasts, occupational therapists and speech therapists together with social
workers acting as a team. The hospital departments work closely with the Dis¬
ablement Resettlement Service of the Employment Service Agency (the De¬
partment of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland).
Medical rehabilitation may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Very severely physically handicapped
patients may be issued with electrical control equipment which enables a person
to operate up to 11 electrical devices such as alarm bells, radio and television, a
telephone, and heating. The controls are operated by continuous depression
of a microswitch or by sustained suction through a pneumatic tube with a
pipe-stem mouthpiece. Nursing aids for the handicapped at home can be
borrowed through the service.
Local authority social workers, home helps and occupational therapists
are available to hospital patients who have difficulties connected with
their illness. Social workers help to solve problems and are concerned with the
rehabilitation and resettlement of patients especially where the illness has been
long or where the disability results in changes in the patient’s life.

Drug
Dependence
The hospital service plays a major part in the treatment of drug dependence,
either in specialised drug dependence units or as part of the general psychiatric
service. Only doctors licensed for the purpose by the Home Secretary may
prescribe heroin and cocaine to addicts in the treatment of addiction and all
medical practitioners are required to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the
Home Office of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain con-

trolled drugs. In Northern Ireland licensing of the doctors is the responsi¬
bility of the Department of Health and Social Services.
Preventive and rehabilitative services are available for drug misusers; these
include advisory and counselling services, day centres and therapeutic residen¬
tial care. Several voluntary organisations provide accommodation for addicts
needing care and help in establishing a new pattern of life.
Treatment is provided for alcoholics as part of the general psychiatric service.
In addition a number of specialised hospital units (including a day hospital)
have been set up. A few experimental detoxification centres are planned as an
entry point to treatment and rehabilitation services for habitual drunken
offenders. Closely linked with treatment are community services covering
prevention, advice to alcoholics and their families, and rehabilitation including,
where necessary, residential care.
Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Maternity and child
health centres are provided either in health centres, purpose built or rented
premises, or in mobile units. Special sessions are held for vaccination and
immunisation and for early testing of babies for vision deficiencies or hearing
loss. A feature of the service is the education of mothers before and after the
birth by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and classes.
About four-fifths of babies in their first year of life are taken to the centres.
Family planning advice and help is provided at many of the centres and
welfare foods (dried milk and vitamins) are distributed from them.
Whenever possible sick children are treated in their own homes, but for those
who need hospital treatment most hospitals have children’s departments under
the oversight of paediatricians and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, which is part of the National Health Service,
provides health surveillance of all children at school with medical and dental
inspection and treatment where appropriate. The staff of the school health
service work closely with local education authorities in the medical assessment
of handicapped children thought to need special attention.
Child guidance facilities provide help and advice concerning children with
psychological or emotional problems. These are run by local authority social
services and education authorities and by the health authorities. In Scotland
child guidance clinics are run by education authorities.
A free family planning service is provided to all irrespective of age, sex or
marital status through family planning clinics, hospitals and familv doctors.
The Abortion Act 1967, which came into force in Great Britain in 1968,
permits the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner if
two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that its continuance
would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical
or mental health of the pregnant woman or any children of her family greater
than if the pregnancy were terminated, or if there is a substantial risk that if a
child were born it would be seriously physically or mentally handicapped.
Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in premises
officially approved for the purpose.
The National Blood Transfusion Service is administered by regional health
authorities in England and by the South Glamorgan Area Health Authority
134 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(Teaching) in Wales. Donors give their blood voluntarily without payment.
There are three central laboratories: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory,
administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the Department of
Health and Social Security, which distributes blood grouping sera and investi¬
gates blood grouping problems referred to it; the Blood Products Laboratory,
administered by the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine on behalf of the
department, which prepares blood products and researches into the production
and uses of plasma fractions and plasma substitutes; and the Plasma Fractiona¬
tion Laboratory which is associated with the Blood Products Laboratory. In
Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the Common
Services Agency. In Northern Ireland the Blood Transfusion Service is
operated by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which provides a
service for all four boards.

Free transport by ambulance in England and Wales between home and hospital
is provided, where necessary, by the health authorities. The Hospital Car
Service (organised by St. John Ambulance, the British Red Cross Society, and
the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance service in
some areas. In Scotland ambulances are run by the Common Services Agency
and in Northern Ireland by the health and social services boards.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Central health education services in Scotland are
organised by the Scottish Health Education Unit, which is part of the Common
Services Agency. Expenditure for health education is met largely from central
governmment funds.
Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are respon¬
sible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of medicines
for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises the minis¬
ters on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of Medicines
advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines
and monitors adverse drug reactions. The Act also controls the advertising,
labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply of medicines.
Only people whose names are on the medical and dentists’ registers may
practise as doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. Dental
auxiliaries (who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental
hygienists (who have undergone a nine-month training course) may carry out
some kinds of simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The qualification for registration as a doctor requires six years’ training in
medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s experience in a hospital;
for a dentist, four or more years at a dental school are required. The governing
body of the medical profession is the General Medical Council and that of the
dentists is the General Dental Council. The British Medical Association is the
doctors’ main professional association; that of the dentists is the British Dental
Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick children s,
mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a two-year
course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England and Wales

and in Scotland are the General Nursing Councils, and in Northern Ireland the
Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Central
Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the Northern Ireland Council of
Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives are already registered general
nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year midwifery training
period is reduced to one year and for other registered and enrolled nurses to 18
months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are
the professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors are registered
general nurses who have undergone at least the first part of the midwifery course
or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s course in health visiting, promoted
by the Council for the Education and Training of Health Visitors. Home nurses
are state registered or state enrolled nurses, the majority of whom have under¬
taken additional training.
To practise as a retail or hospital pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist must
have his or her name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or, in Northern
Ireland, by the registrar appointed by the Department of Health and Social
Services. Four years’ academic study and practical training are necessary for
registration. The dispensing of all medicines on doctors’ prescriptions and sale
of certain specified medicines can be carried out only by, or under the super¬
vision of, a registered pharmaceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 1958
the General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispens¬
ing opticians may take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards,
corresponding to the eight professions, under the general supervision of the
Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. A professional training
lasting two to four years is needed to qualify for registration. Only members of
those professions who are state registered may be employed in the National
Health Service and some other public services.
Reciprocal health agreements have been concluded between Britain and a
number of other countries. In addition, under the terms of the social security
regulations of the European Community, United Kingdom nationals and
nationals of other Community countries who are resident in Britain and who
normally work for an employer or are pensioners are entitled to urgent medical
treatment in another Community country on the same basis as insured nationals
of that country; the regulations also apply to dependants.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of subscribers to the provident
schemes which make provision for private health care in return for annual
subscriptions. Although it is the Government’s policy to phase out private beds
from National Health Service hospitals, patients will remain free to seek
medical treatment, and doctors to practise, in private hospitals or nursing
homes. Some of these are run by charitable institutions.

DISEASES
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local authorities are responsible for environmental health. Environmental
health officers are employed by the authorities to assist them to carry out
functions concerning the control of air pollution and noise, working conditions
in offices and factories, the investigation of unfit housing, and refuse collec¬
tion and disposal. Community physicians (administrative doctors employed by
the health authority) are available to local authorities; they serve as Medical
Officers for Environmental Health and advise local authorities on the medical
aspects of environmental health. Community physicians may also assist the
water authorities (see p. 273) which have responsibility for water supply and
sewerage.
Environmental health officers are also employed at ports and airports where
they carry out a range of duties concerned with shipping, inspection of imported
foods and disease control.
In Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collec¬
tion and disposal of refuse, clean air and food hygiene.
The composition, labelling and description of food, food hygiene and the
safety and fitness of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Act 195 5
England and Wales and similar legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland
and statutory regulations. In England and Wales the composition, labelling
and description of food are the concern of food and drugs authorities (county
councils, London borough councils and the City of London Corporation)
while food hygiene and the safety and fitness of food are the concern of
district councils, London borough councils and port health authorities.
The Department of Health and Social Security and the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for
giving advice and making regulations. Premises where food or drink is prepared,
handled, stored or sold must conform to certain hygiene standards. Environ¬
mental health officers may take for analysis or for bacteriological or other
examination samples of any food for sale for human consumption. There are
special regulations for milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are regional and islands
councils who are responsible for food standards and labelling and district and
islands councils who have responsibility for food hygiene.
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of disease
and co-operate with the local authority environmental health services. The
area health authorities and health boards carry out planned programmes of
vaccination and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (females
only), poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Such protec¬
tion is given in family doctors’ surgeries, health centres or at child health
centres.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at
Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. In Scotland
there is no separate public health laboratory service and bacteriological
work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern Ireland a central
public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with hospital
laboratories.

Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services authori¬
ties (local authority social services departments in England and Wales, social
work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in North¬
ern Ireland). Many of the services which they provide are directed towards the
same groups of people who also have a great need for health services, for
example, elderly or disabled people. Other groups helped are young families
with social problems, children deprived of a normal home life, the mentally
disordered and young offenders. Many adults and children in these groups are
also in need of medical and psychiatric services. Close co-operation is main¬
tained between local authority social services departments and health authorities.
In England and Wales the powers and duties of local authorities to provide
these varied social services derive from a number of statutes; some of the main
Acts are mentioned in their context in the succeeding pages. In Scotland many
of the corresponding duties derive from the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968
in accordance with which Scottish local authorities also undertake duties
similar to those of the separate probation and after-care service in England and
Wales. The Personal Social Services Council advises ministers on policy issues
and provides information and advice to all concerned with the personal social
services in England and Wales, based on research projects or inquiries spon¬
sored by the council. Its members are from local government, voluntary,
educational and research bodies and professional organisations. There is cross¬
representation with the Central Health Services Council and the Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work. Finance comes from
central and local government. In Scotland there is an Advisory Council on
Social Work and in Northern Ireland a Central Personal Social Services
Advisory Committee.
Social services authorities have a duty to provide social services for disabled
people, the blind and partially sighted, those with impaired hearing and other
physically handicapped groups. Local authorities in Great Britain are required
to inform themselves of the number of handicapped people in their area and to
publicise services. A wide range of facilities may be available, including advice
on personal, social and occupational problems arising from disability; assistance
in overcoming the effects of disability; help in carrying out adaptations in the
home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways, ground floor toilets,
guide rails, and the provision of various aids to living to meet individual needs,
including, in certain circumstances, help towards obtaining a telephone and a
television set; social and occupational centres and clubs; residential homes;
teaching of handicrafts and other occupations either at home or in centres; and
the provision of recreational facilities, outings and holidays.
Help available from other sources includes social security, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, employment and training services and
specially designed housing and means of access to public buildings.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped children
see p. 148 and the child health centres and the school health service, p. 133.)
Services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by statutory and
voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible. These
include the advice and help of social workers, domestic help, sitters-in, night
attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, clubs, recreational work¬
shops and meals services. In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting
services are also arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation.
Chiropody services for the elderly are provided by area health authorities.

Social services authorities also provide residential accommodation for the
elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisa¬
tions or privately. The newer homes usually have accommodation for 30 to 50
residents. About 2,500 homes for elderly people are provided by local authori¬
ties in England which house about 1*5 per cent of the population over the age
of 65. Similar homes are provided in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided an
increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for frail or
infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help. Local
authorities may contribute towards the cost of employing a warden in such
specially designed housing.
Social services authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally ill or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention and
after-care services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness,
which enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social work support,
though helping to contain and reduce the need for in-patient treatment.
Arrangements include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day
centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential
care for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. Social workers
help patients and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental
illness or mental handicap.
Help to Families Social services authorities, through their own social workers or through a
voluntary organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special
problems.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is provided mainly for elderly
people but others receiving it include pregnant women and severely disabled,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people.
Some authorities make direct provision for the special needs of unmarried
mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done by
voluntary organisations and other bodies.
For the homeless, local authorities arrange temporary accommodation.
Child Care Social services authorities are responsible for child care. This includes the
provision of day care for children, often with special social or health needs, and
is done through day nurseries and part-time nursery groups, voluntary and
private day nurseries, child minders and play-groups.
The authorities have a duty to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties in order to promote the welfare of children. The aim is
to intervene at an early stage to diminish the need to receive children into care
or bring them before a juvenile court.
The authorities have a duty to receive into their care any child under the
age of 17 who has no parent or guardian or who has been abandoned or whose
parents are unable to provide for him. The child remains in care until he is 18
years old unless discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends
before that time. Under the Children Act 1975 local authorities in Great
Britain, when taking a decision on a child in care, have to give first considera¬
tion to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child. Where
children are in care, efforts are made to work with their families in order,
where appropriate, to enable the child to return home.

The Children and Young Persons Act 1969 (for England and Wales) provides
for children to be brought before a juvenile court if they are neglected or ill
treated, exposed to moral danger, beyond the control of parents, not attending
school or have committed an offence. At the same time it must be shown
that the child is in need of care or control which he is unlikely to receive
unless a care or other relevant order is made by the court. The Act gives
local authorities responsibilities for undertaking, through social workers,
inquiries and consultations with parents, schools and the police.
Children under 17 who are charged with offences or thought to be in need
of care or control are almost always dealt with in a juvenile court (or a children’s
hearing in Scotland).
In England and Wales a child may be committed to the care of a local
authority under a care order if the juvenile court is satisfied that he is in need
of care or control. A care order remains in force until a child’s eighteenth
birthday (or nineteenth if made after he is 16) unless revoked earlier by the
court. As an alternative the court may issue a supervision order for a period
of up to three years. Supervision is carried out by a social worker or a probation
officer. In Northern Ireland the court may send the child to a training school,
commit him to the care of a fit person (which may include a health and social
services board) or make a supervision order. In Scotland, under the provisions
of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, children’s hearings, composed of
people from the local community, have powers to impose compulsory measures
of care on a child by means of a supervision requirement which can remain
in force until he is 18 years old.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
the most suitable place for a child or if a suitable foster home cannot be found
for him, he may be placed in a children’s home, a voluntary home or other
suitable residential accommodation. Community homes for children in the
care of local authorities in England and Wales are provided under plans
formulated by regional planning committees in accordance with the Children
and Young Persons Act 1969. These homes comprise local authority and
voluntary children’s homes and community homes with education on the
premises which provide long-term care usually for the more difficult children.
In Scotland local authorities are responsible for providing accommodation for
children in their care and arrangements exist for the development of services
on a regional basis. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes for children
in the care of the health and social services boards, although training schools
and remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations regarding conduct of community homes and registered
voluntary homes and the boarding out of children in care are made for
England and Wales by the Secretary of State for Social Services and the
Secretary of State for Wales and, for Scotland, by the Secretary of State for
Scotland. There is similar control over the health and social services boards
and voluntary organisations in Northern Ireland.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations must be registered. Arrangements for the care of children and
their accommodation are subject to inspection by social work service officers of
the Department of Health and Social Security, the Welsh Office, the Scottish
Education Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Health and
Social Services.

Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own
homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its
Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported
cruelty or neglect.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. About 23,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400 in
Northern Ireland. Adoption is regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in Great
Britain, as amended by the Children Act 1975, and by the Adoption Act
(Northern Ireland) 1967 in Northern Ireland. The Registrars General keep
registers of adopted children. In Great Britain local authorities have had
the power since 1959 to act as adoption agencies and many do so. Under the
Children Act 1975 local authorities will be obliged to offer an adoption service.
Adoption societies (over 70 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered
with the local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of most European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised in Great Britain by virtue of the Adoption (Designa¬
tion of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973. The recognition does not confer on
the adopted person citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.
The effective operation of the social services is dependent upon the availability
of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of social
work. The length of training is usually two years. The Central Council for
Education and Training in Social Work is responsible for recognising social
work courses and offers advice to people considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are employed by social services authorities. Others work in voluntary
organisations or in the probation service (see p. 92).
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, one of the most comprehensive in the world,
came into force in December 1975 and makes discrimination between men
and women unlawful in employment, education, provision of housing,
goods, facilities and services and advertising. Sex discrimination is defined as
treating a person less favourably than another on the grounds of his or her sex.
Although the Act does not apply in Northern Ireland, similar legislation will
come into effect there on 1st December 1976.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 (and corresponding legislation in Northern
Ireland), which came into effect in December 1975, women are entitled to
equal pay with men when doing work that is the same or broadly similar. The
Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the enforcement of both Acts and
promotes equal opportunities between the sexes.
Employers must not discriminate against a man or woman because of his or
her sex. This applies to recruitment, promotion and training. It is also unlawful
for employers to discriminate against a person on grounds of marriage. There
is a limited number of exceptions including employment in private households
and employment in jobs where a person’s sex is a ‘genuine occupational
qualification’, such as acting. Employers of not more than five people are
exempt from the Act. Co-educational schools, colleges and universities may

not discriminate in the provision of facilities or in their admissions. Single sex
establishments are permissible, however, and there are arrangements for
such institutions to move gradually towards co-education if they wish.
It is unlawful to discriminate against a man or a woman in the sale or letting
of land, houses, flats and business premises. The law applies equally to public
and private housing, furnished and unfurnished. The Act does not apply to
lettings in a small dwelling occupied by the landlord.
Discrimination is also unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and
services. For example, banks, building societies or finance companies cannot
refuse to give credit, mortgages or loans to women on the same terms as would
be applied to men. Exceptions include services provided in certain special
care establishments such as hospitals; places used for religious purposes
where religious susceptibilities would be offended; places where it is necessary
to preserve privacy; competitive sports in which, for reasons of physique,
women would be at a disadvantage; and life insurance and similar matters
where risk is assessed on reliable actuarial or other data.
It is unlawful to publish or place discriminatory advertisements whether
for jobs, goods, facilities or services. These are not unlawful if they apply only
to the exceptions set out by the Sex Discrimination Act.
Complaints of discrimination may be brought before the county courts in
England and Wales or the sheriff courts in Scotland, except for complaints
concerning employment which are dealt with by industrial tribunals (see
p. ioi). Complaints concerning State educational establishments must first
be made to the relevant Secretary of State before they can be brought before
a court. The Equal Opportunities Commission is solely responsible for
handling complaints about discriminatory advertisements and can bring
proceedings in matters concerning advertising. Where necessary legal aid
(see p. 106) is available for complainants with low incomes.
The Equal Opportunities Commission helps to enforce the Sex Discrimination
Act and the Equal Pay Act. It has power to conduct formal investigations and
if satisfied that practices are unlawful, it can issue non-discrimination notices
requiring that they cease. For certain formal investigations, the commission
has the power to require a person to give information and to attend hearings
to give evidence. Another of its functions is to advise people of their rights
under the Act. In certain circumstances it may also assist an individual to
prepare and conduct a case before a court and may attempt to secure a settle¬
ment. The Commission also keeps under review the workings of both Acts
and may submit proposals for amending them to the Home Secretary.
IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to take up employ¬
ment, many with the intention of settling permanently. It is estimated that
coloured Commonwealth and Pakistani immigrants and their families num¬
bered some 1-33 million at the time of the 1971 census, (about per cent of the
total population of Great Britain) nearly 40 per cent of whom were born there.
The ethnic minorities make an important contribution to the economy and
public services and have settled mainly in urban areas where opportunities
for employment are greatest. Two-thirds live in the major urban areas of

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England—Greater London and Birmingham having the greatest numbers.
The difficulties experienced by residents of the older inner urban areas
are being alleviated by continuous social service programmes in housing,
education, hospitals, health and personal social services, which benefit the
whole community and by other social programmes which are directed at
areas of special need. Additional teachers have been appointed to schools in
immigrant areas and government grants are available to local authorities
with substantial immigrant populations towards the salaries of extra staff,
such as interpreters, health visitors and helpers in schools and community
homes. Language teaching is recognised to be of prime importance in schools
and schemes arranged for adults include classes at their place of work. The
welfare of immigrants and good relations between minority groups and the
local community are promoted by community relations councils and other
voluntary bodies.
The co-ordination of government action to promote harmonious community
relations is the responsibility of the Home Office. Voluntary efforts are co¬
ordinated nationally by the Community Relations Commission, a statutory
body set up under the Race Relations Act 1968. The commission co-ordinates
the activities of local community relations councils, of which there are about
85 operating in areas with significant minority-group populations. It makes
grants towards the salaries of community relations officers and assistants
and towards special projects which help to improve community relations and
makes recommendations to the Home Secretary on matters affecting com¬
munity relations. The commission gives specialist advice to those working
in social services, including education, employment and youth services. Under
the new race relations legislation before Parliament the commission s functions
will pass to the Commission for Racial Equality (see below).
Discrimination on grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin in
places of public resort was first made unlawful in Great Britain by the Race
Relations Act 1965, which established a Race Relations Board to secure
compliance with the Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 extended the provisions
of the 1965 Act, making discrimination unlawful in the provision of goods,
facilities and services in employment and housing and in advertising. The
board investigates complaints of discrimination, seeking to resolve them by
conciliation. If this fails, it may take court proceedings.
Under a Bill introduced in Parliament in February 1976 the legislation
would be further strengthened and brought into line with the law against sex
discrimination. The Race Relations Board and the Community Relations
Commission would be replaced by a new body, the Commission for Racial
Equality, which would be largely responsible for policy matters and would co¬
ordinate the work of the local community relations councils. Complaints of
discrimination would be dealt with mainly by specially designated county
courts in England and Wales (sheriff courts in Scotland) with the exception
of employment complaints which would be considered by industrial tribunals.
7 Education
There are nearly 12 million pupils and students in full-time attendance at
schools and institutions of further and higher education in Britain. The great
majority of schools, attended by over 95 per cent of school children, and most
further education establishments are publicly maintained or assisted. Univer¬
sities are autonomous self-governing institutions but are also aided from public
funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although some older-established schools and colleges continue to benefit from
private endowments. In 1975-76 estimated total public expenditure on educa¬
tion, including school meals, milk, local libraries and museums, amounted to
over £6,350 million, which was 12-4 per cent of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education started over a hundred years ago. In 1833 the Government had
begun to make annual grants to the voluntary societies which were providing
schools, but the Elementary Education Act of 1870 first established the prin¬
ciple of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century elementary
education had become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public
provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England
under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public educa¬
tion in England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational

Education (Scotland) Act 1962 and the Education and Libraries (Northern
Ireland) Order 1972, but the same general policy is implemented throughout
Britain, with some national variations.
A ten-year education programme for England and Wales was announced by
the Government in 1972. It involved substantially increased expenditure in
five sectors: a new programme of nursery education (see p. 147); a larger
144

building programme for the renewal of secondary and special, as well as pri¬
mary, schools; a larger teaching force to improve further the staffing standards
in schools; new measures to improve the pre-service and in-service training of
teachers; and the development in higher education of a wider range of oppor¬
tunities for both students and institutions. It also stressed the need to give
priority treatment to certain deprived areas. Similar proposals were made for
Scotland. The original programme has been somewhat scaled down as from
1975 in the light of the economic situation and of revised (lower) estimates of
future school population. Improved provision for those of compulsory school
age, however, remains a priority. Broadly parallel developments are taking
place in Northern Ireland.
As part of a policy of special educational help to children suffering from par¬
ticular social difficulties, including immigrants, the Government during 1974
established an Educational Disadvantage Unit and in 1975 set up a related non¬
government advisory centre. Both work in co-operation with an Assessment of
Performance Unit with the wider brief of finding out in England and Wales
why some children, of all ranges of ability, fall below their potential. In addition
government funds of about £3 million have been allocated to promote measures
to reduce adult illiteracy (see p. 157).
Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain: the Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, for further education in
Wales, and for universities, civil science and the arts throughout Great Britain,
the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for nursery, primary and secon¬
dary education in Wales; the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland have full educational responsibilities in their countries except that the
Secretary of State for Scotland is consulted about Scottish universities but is
not responsible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Northern Ireland Department of Education), local education authorities
(education and library boards in Northern Ireland), and various voluntary
organisations. Their relationship is based on consultation and co-operation.
The local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and most post-school education outside the universities, and provide
grants to students proceeding to higher education (including the universities).
In Scotland the central institutions (colleges of higher education) and colleges
of education (for teacher training), which are administered by independent
governing bodies, are financed directly by the Scottish Education Department
and grants to students are also paid by the department. In Northern Ireland
the Ulster College (an institution of higher education) is likewise administered
by an independent board of governors and is financed directly by the Northern
Ireland Department of Education. Colleges of education are controlled by the
department or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent and their governing
bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters or
statutory provisions. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation
to the universities through the University Grants Committee (see p. i52)-
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.

There were over n million children attending some 38,000 schools in
Britain in 1975. Most were receiving free education financed from public funds
(9-2 million in England and Wales and 1-05 million in Scotland), while a small
proportion were attending schools wholly independent of public financial
support (434,476 in England and Wales and 18,054 in Scotland). In addition,
131,204 children in England and Wales and 20,268 in Scotland were attending
schools receiving grants direct from the education department concerned. This
direct grant system is being phased out (see p. 148). In Northern Ireland
373,160 children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools and in an increas¬
ing number of secondary schools. Some 79 per cent of pupils in maintained
secondary schools in England and Wales and about 52 per cent in Northern
Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools are
mixed. In the independent sector most of the schools for younger children are
co-educational; but of those providing secondary education the majority are
single sex.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group), provided and maintained by local
education authorities wholly out of public funds; and voluntary schools,
mostly aided or ‘controlled’ by a voluntary body, usually of a religious denomi¬
nation. The local education authority is responsible for the running costs of all
voluntary schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools.
Each school has a group of managers or governors, some or all of whom are
appointed by the local education authority. Aided schools have more indepen¬
dence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of external
repairs and any building work (see p. 150). About a third of the 28,315 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary
schools and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are
2,646 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to
other religious bodies. In Scotland most of the schools supported from public
funds are provided by education authorities and are l^nown as public schools
(in England this term is used for a type of independent school, see p. 149). In
Northern Ireland controlled schools managed by education and library boards
and voluntary schools managed by maintained school committees, boards of
governors and individual managers (usually clergymen) are both grant-aided
from public funds.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools (over 94 per cent of the school population) and books and
equipment are free. In Scotland, education authorities have power to charge
fees where this can be done without prejudice to the adequate provision of free
school education. In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of
children attending grant-aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools,
where qualified pupils receive from the education authorities scholarships
which cover the whole or most of the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority, or, in the case of voluntary aided
secondary schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice there is a very high
degree of devolution to headteachers, particularly in nursery and primary
schools. In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main
or secondary medium of teaching in many schools. Her Majesty’s Inspectors of
146
Religion

Innovation
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Schools are responsible for the inspection of all schools including independent
schools. They review and report on the content and value of the education pro¬
vided and are available as advisors. Local education authorities also employ
inspectors to guide them on maintained schools. Teachers’ organisations and
institutions concerned with the education and training of teachers are additional
sources of advice. Further guidance and encouragement for school-based
research and development is available to teachers through the Schools Council
for Curriculum and Examinations. The council, an independent body repre¬
sentative of all educational interests, acts as an advisory body and carries out
research and development work on curricula, teaching methods and examina¬
tions in primary and secondary schools.
In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same;
the content and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous review by
the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Provision is made, where
appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic. Northern Ireland has a Schools
Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools Council;
the Inspectorate of the Department of Education provides help and advice to
teachers and is responsible for the inspection and evaluation of the work of all
schools.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and in certain cir¬
cumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of a non-denominational
character is given which may include the study of comparative religions. (In
areas with large immigrant populations this can take the form of lessons on
comparative cultures.) In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for
denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the indi¬
vidual conscience, religious instruction must be given, but the content is
determined by education authorities or, more commonly, by the schools
themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own schools. In
controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access which may
be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools corporate worship
and religious education are controlled by the management authorities.
The schools’ freedom to frame their own curricula has facilitated a rapid in¬
crease in study and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council and
other organisations. The general purpose is to adapt the curriculum to the
everyday life and needs of children and young people.
The rapid advance of knowledge, social change, technical progress and new
understanding of children’s emotional and intellectual development have en¬
couraged changes in the content and methods of teaching.
Among the most clearly observable general trends have been the increased
emphasis, particularly for younger children, on ‘learning by doing’; the efforts
to reduce or modify ‘streaming’ (grouping according to ability) in such a way
as to minimise its ill effects on children placed in a lower stream; and the in¬
creased importance attached to motivation. At the same time greater use is
being made of new educational aids produced by technical progress.
Broadcasting is a major resource for school teachers—about nine out of ten
schools can receive television, and almost all have radios. Nearly all primary
schools and some seven out of ten secondary schools use educational broadcasts.
Relaxation of copyright for educational purposes now enables schools to record
and replay programmes to pupils and greatly helps their efficient and flexible

use. Schools co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual presentation,
including (in addition to television, radio and tape recordings) films, colour
slides, wall charts, maps and models. The BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes for
schools use, for example, colour film strips in conjunction with a tape recording
of the broadcast, and a similar technique is used in the support activities
provided with some Independent Television schools broadcasts.
The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom and the
Educational Foundation for Visual Aids advise all bodies connected with educa¬
tion (and with training in industry and in the services) on the use of audio-visual
aids.
The language laboratory, the teaching machine and the computer have all
made their impact—notably through their general influence in teaching
methods (the oral approach to language, the programmed teaching book).
Computers are used to some extent to assist learning by means of calculation
and the simulation of situations; they are used widely in secondary schools
in the planning of timetables; and they help in the management of courses in
some schools.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have the
use of a playing field, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium. Organised
games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service (part of the National Health Service) provides for
medical inspection of school children and for advice and treatment of specific
medical and dental problems associated with children of school age.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint, ciq litre, a day) is given free to children
of 7 years or under, to children aged between 7 and 12 if they have a medical
requirement, and to pupils in special schools for the handicapped. The School
Meals Service provides a mid-day meal at a subsidised charge (remitted where
there is need). About 70 per cent of pupils in England and Wales, 50 per cent of
pupils in Scotland and 57 per cent of pupils in Northern Ireland schools make
use of the service. Education authorities have a statutory duty under certain
conditions to provide free school transport; and have discretionary powers to
assist financially in the provision of transport for pupils between home and
school and for other school activities.
In Great Britain the Government has allocated resources for the improvement
of educational facilities in ‘priority areas’ (educationally deprived areas) under
several schemes, including the Urban Programme (see p. 119), the Educational
Priority Area Project (sponsored jointly by the Department of Education and
Science and the Social Science Research Council) and the Community Deve¬
lopment Project (sponsored by the Home Office). Special annual increments
have been introduced for teachers employed in schools of exceptional diffi¬
culty, and additional funds have been allocated for school building in these
areas. Community schools, pre-school experiments and new approaches to
adult education have been encouraged.
Facilities for informal education and play for children aged two to five are pro¬
vided free in public sector nursery schools and nursery classes in public sector
primary schools, and are also available for a fee in a few independent schools
and a large number of ‘pre-school play groups’ organised by voluntary organisa¬
tions or by groups of parents. Apart from children only just under five, the
proportion ofchildren aged two to four who attend public sector schools remains
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
low (the supply of places being inadequate to meet the demand for them)
though attendance, and particularly part-time attendance, has been increasing
very rapidly in recent years. Compulsory education begins at five when children
in England and Wales go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on
to junior schools or departments. The usual age of transfer from primary to
secondary schools is 11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but an increas¬
ing number of local authorities in England are establishing ‘first’ schools for
pupils aged 5-8 or 10 and ‘middle’ schools covering various age ranges between
9 and 14. In Scotland, the primary schools take children from 5 to 12, normally
having infant classes for children under 7> although in some areas there are
separate infant schools.
Secondary
Schools
England and Wales
The public or State system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. About 70 per cent of the maintained secon¬
dary school population in England and Wales attend 3)°^9 comprehensive
schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and provide
a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of a district.
They can be organised in a number of ways including schools that take the full
secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; the middle schools whose pupils
move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12 or 13, leaving at 16 or 18; and
the comprehensive school with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a
sixth-form college for pupils over 16. Most of the remaining children receive
their secondary education in schools to which they are allocated after selection
procedures at the age of 11. Schools receiving pupils on a selective basis are:
about 740 grammar schools providing a mainly academic education (including
174 direct-grant grammar schools); some 1,216 secondary modern schools giving
a general education with a practical bias; a few secondary technical schools
offering a general education related to industry, commerce and agriculture;
and schools providing all three, or any two, types of education, in separately
organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
In 1975 the Government introduced legislation designed to hasten progress
towards a fully comprehensive system of secondary education including the
phasing out of the direct-grant system. A number of direct-grant schools have
agreed to end selection and join the State comprehensive system, while others
have announced their intention of becoming independent (see below).
Scotland Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised on compre¬
hensive lines and in 1975, about 98-6 per cent of all pupils in education
authority secondary schools were in schools with a comprehensive intake.
The majority of schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because of local
circumstances there are some comprehensive schools whose courses may
extend to four years or less and from which pupils may transfer at the end
of their second or fourth years to a six-year comprehensive school.
Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools and secondary (intermediate)
schools, the latter being the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in
England and Wales. Some comprehensive-type schools exist, and arrangements
for transfer between the other types of schools are flexible. In 1976 the Govern¬
ment published a consultative document containing a feasibility study on the
reorganisation of secondary education.
Special Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical

special schools (including hospital schools). It has long been government
policy not to send to special schools those handicapped children who can be
educated satisfactorily at an ordinary school. There are, however, some 1,800
special schools including hospital schools, day and boarding schools and there
are also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
There are 11 categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in
Scotland), epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped, autistic and children
suffering from speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in
Scotland. As many children have multiple handicaps there is a growing ten¬
dency to relate educational needs to over-all medical condition and to use the
system of categories for administrative purposes only.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public funds
but all are open to inspection and must register with the Department of Edu¬
cation and Science or the Welsh Office which has power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or in¬
struction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be
the proprietor of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can, in
effect, close a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent
Schools Tribunal against any of the requirements. The schools whose standards
are regarded by the department or the Welsh Office as comparable with those
of well-run maintained schools are, on application, granted the status of ‘recog¬
nised as efficient . Such schools (1,482 of 2,615 independent schools registered)
contain 80 per cent of the pupils in independent schools. In Scotland where
there are 103 registered schools, the position is generally the same except that
there is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status. In Northern Ireland there are only
four independent schools; these have to be registered with the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland and be open to inspection. As in England and
Wales they receive no grants from public funds.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most im¬
portant of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or 13
years of age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There are
about 260 public schools, most of them still single sex (about half of them for
girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some coeducational schools and
certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit some girls direct to their top
forms. Combined tuition and boarding fees in the public schools are usually
between £1,200 and £1,600 a year, but some of this may be remitted for
children winning competitive scholarships. A number of preparatory schools,
day and boarding, coeducational and single sex prepare children for entry to
the public schools.
Over the past decade there has been a large increase in the number of pupils
staying on at each age beyond the minimum school-leaving age, which was
raised from 15 to 16 in 1972.
There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
Public schools are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head-
™s.t<;rsc Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of

to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of
Education (GCE). The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’
secondary education and is normally taken at the age of 16. It is controlled by
14 Regional Examining Boards, consisting mainly of teachers serving in the
schools which provide the candidates. The highest grade in the CSE (grade 1)
is widely accepted as being of the same standard as at least grade C at GCE
‘Ordinary’ level. Control over the scope and standards of the examinations is
exercised by the Schools Council (see p. 146) to ensure national comparability.
The GCE is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels. Normally
candidates taking ‘O’ level are about 16 years of age, although some take it
earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most pupils in grammar, direct
grant and independent schools take the ‘O’ level examination, and so do a
number of pupils in comprehensive and other secondary schools.
Grade C or above in various subjects at GCE ‘O’ level and the equivalent
CSE grade 1 are usually considered to be qualifications for entry to courses of
further education and training. Since the inception of the CSE the number
achieving the highest grade has increased steadily as the popularity of the
examination has grown while GCE ‘O’ level subject performances have also
improved. The ‘A’ level examination is at the standard for entrance to university
and for entry to many forms of professional training. Since 1965 the number of
school-leavers obtaining two or more ‘A’ levels (the minimum qualification for
entry to first degree courses at university) has increased by about 25 per cent.
Entries for both levels of the GCE are accepted from candidates at further
education establishments and from candidates entering privately.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Edu¬
cation Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the Ordinary grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth year are presented for
the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the basis for entry to uni¬
versity or professional training. For those who have completed their main
studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in particular
subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and W ales.
School Building Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central depart¬
ments determine the maximum size of the authorities’ individual programmes
in the light of national priorities; they also offer guidance to authorities by
means of building bulletins and in other ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 16,300 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing State schools; over
9 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building
of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to exist¬
ing aided schools.
In Northern Ireland capital grants of 85 per cent are available for voluntary
schools managed by maintained school committees and voluntary grammar
schools which have entered into an agreement under statutory provisions.

The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well as to
have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor games.
Space is being used more flexibly, particularly in primary schools to meet the
needs of new teaching methods.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or school governing bodies or managers. Such teachers must hold
qualifications approved by the appropriate education department (see p. 144).
Their salaries are determined by nationally negotiated scales taking account
of qualifications, responsibilities and experience. In 1975 there were about
520,000 teachers (including the full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in
publicly maintained schools in Britain. The expected fall in school population
will, in the longer term, permit continued improvement in the pupil-teacher
ratio (about 20 to one) without further expansion of the teacher force.
Education for those who have left school is organised very flexibly. It is avail¬
able to everyone above school-leaving age, is provided at all levels and may be
part-time or full-time, vocational or non-vocational. Many courses lead to
recognised qualifications, varying from degrees and professional qualifications
through technician level to qualifications similar to those obtained before leav¬
ing school. Further education is a broad term usually taken to refer to all post¬
school education outside the universities. Higher education (postgraduate,
first degree and similar level work) is provided at universities and on advanced
courses at polytechnics and other establishments of further education. Adults
of every age make extensive use of widespread and varied facilities for the
educational and cultural leisure activities included under the term ‘adult
education’ (see p. 156).
The principal institutions of post-school education are the 45 universities (see
P- 153); the 30 polytechnics in England and Wales and the 14 Scottish central
institutions, in which advanced (or higher) courses outside the universities are
increasingly being concentrated; the Ulster College in Northern Ireland; and
about 790 other colleges, some of which have a very wide range of courses,
while others concentrate on particular subjects. These colleges include the
liberal arts colleges in England and Wales into which the former colleges of
education (for teacher training) have been assimilated. All these institutions
offer courses leading to recognised qualifications, while their premises as
well as school and other premises are often also used for adult education.
Apart from the universities, most general-purpose establishments of post¬
school education and many specialist establishments are maintained and
administered by the local education authorities. The Scottish central institu¬
tions, however, the Scottish colleges of education and the Ulster College do
not come under the control of the education authorities, but are managed by
independent governing bodies, representative of the authorities and other
appropriate interests.
In addition, there are many independent specialist establishments, such as
secretarial colleges, correspondence colleges and colleges teaching English as a
foreign language; a number of voluntary bodies and private undertakings
providing cultural and general education, sometimes with financial or other
assistance from local education authorities; and a large number of other
education and training schemes run by public or private organisations.

Education
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most establishments for post-school education are either maintained or assisted
from public funds. Tuition fees at these establishments are moderate and
nearly always remitted for young people under 18 years of age. Where in¬
dustrial training is provided by a college, the charges are the responsibility
of the employer, and broadly reflect the economic cost of provision. Many
full-time students are helped by awards from public funds. These awards are
mandatory for students who are taking university first degree and other com¬
parable courses. They are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance
grant; but parents who can afford to contribute towards the cost are required
to do so. In England and Wales these awards are made by local education
authorities up to first degree level, while in Scotland awards to students on
advanced level courses are made by the Scottish Education Department. In
Northern Ireland awards up to first degree level are made by the education and
library boards. Grants for postgraduate study and research are offered by the
education departments and the research councils. In all, about 90 per cent of
full-time students on advanced courses receive help from public funds. There
are also some scholarships available from endowments and from particular
industries or companies.
The universities, like most of the other main post-school educational estab¬
lishments, are ultimately dependent on public finance. They have, however,
remained autonomous institutions, largely because of the special system by
which they are financed. The University Grants Committee is appointed by the
Secretary of State for Education and Science to advise on State aid to the uni¬
versities; its members are drawn from the academic and business worlds. This
body acts as a link and buffer between the Government from which it receives
a block grant and the universities to which it allocates this grant. (The Open
University, see p. 154, is financed directly by the Department of Education and
Science, not through the University Grants Committee; and in Northern
Ireland, government grants are made direct to the universities by the Depart¬
ment of Education which first seeks the advice of the University Grants Com¬
mittee.) So, although the Government is responsible for financing about 90 per
cent of universities’ central expenditure (colleges within universities may have
their own investments, endowments and budgets), it does not control their
work or teaching.
In 1974-75 there were about 773,000 students taking full-time and sandwich
courses (courses where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with
periods of supervised experience on a relevant job) at universities and other
major establishments of further education in Britain. Of these about 258,000
were at universities while another 239,000 were following advanced courses
outside universities, mainly at colleges of education, polytechnics and Scottish
central institutions. Another 276,000 were taking non-advanced courses, over
80 per cent of them studying for recognised vocational or educational
qualifications.
Additionally, there were about 1 -66 million part-time students, some 630,000
of whom were mostly young people released by their employers for study
during working hours. The remainder were for the most part taking some of
the wide variety of adult education classes (see p. 156).
There has been a rapid expansion in higher education in the last 12 years; the
numbers in full-time higher education in Britain increased from 222,400 in
1962 to 497,000 in 1975. This expansion has been achieved by creating ten new
universities; by developing a number of colleges into universities, 30 of them

into polytechnics specialising in advanced work; by widening the range and
flexibility of courses; and by the establishment of the Open University.
There are 45 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. In addition, the University College at Buckingham, which
receives no assistance from public funds, began courses in 1976 but has not yet
achieved university status.
The English universities are: Aston1 (Birmingham), Bath,1 Birmingham,
Bradford,1 Bristol, Brunei1 (London), Cambridge, City1 (London), Durham,
East Anglia,1 Essex,1 Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury,1 Lancaster,1
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough,1 Manchester, New¬
castle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford,1 Sheffield, South¬
ampton, Surrey,1 Sussex,1 Warwick,1 and York1. The federated University
of Wales includes five university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medi¬
cine, and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The
Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,1 Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-
Watt1 (Edinburgh), St Andrews, Stirling,1 and Strathclyde1 (Glasgow). In
Northern Ireland there is the Queen’s University of Belfast, and the New
University of Ulster1 in Coleraine.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour, nationality or sex bar, though in practice there are
about twice as many men as women. Prospective candidates for nearly all the
universities apply for places through the Universities Central Council on
Admissions. The only students to apply directly are applicants to the Open
University and British candidates who apply only to the universities of Glas¬
gow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
Most students at universities are undergraduates: in 1974-75 there were
about 258,000 full-time university students in Britain, including nearly 49,000
postgraduates. Just under a half lived in colleges and halls of residence, over
one-third were in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder lived
at home. There were about 32,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly
from university funds. The ratio of staff to students was about one to eight, one
of the most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first degree courses are mainly full-time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses may
require five or six. A full-time course at a university remains the most usual way
of obtaining a first degree, in spite of the extension of facilities for obtaining a
degree in other ways. About four-fifths of all students on full-time first degree
courses are at universities. The range of courses is wide and has been increasing,
and becoming more flexible with greater choice of combinations of subjects.
Nearly half the university undergraduates, however, are taking courses within
the categories of science or social administration and business studies’.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university; in
England and Wales the commonest titles for a first degree are Bachelor of Arts
(BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), while in Scotland Master is used for a
first degree. On the other hand, uniformity of standards between universities

is promoted by the practice of employing outside examiners for all university
examinations, while the general pattern of teaching (a combination of lectures,
small group seminars or tutorials with practical classes where necessary) is
fairly similar throughout Britain.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio broad¬
casts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a network
of viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are
required to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the
same as those of other universities. The university’s first degree, the BA (open),
is a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course completed;
the average amount of study needed for a full course is estimated at 12 to 14
hours a week. The first courses began in January 1971 and in July 1976 some
50,000 students were following courses. The Open University has a consult¬
ancy service to make its advice and facilities available on a fee-paying but non-
profit-making basis to bodies throughout the world interested in ‘teaching at a
distance’ projects.
Until 1975 the majority of teachers in England and Wales qualified by taking a
three-year course at one of some 150 colleges of education, so as to obtain a
teacher’s certificate. Since 1970 professional training for newly qualified
people with degrees and certain other specialist qualifications (who before
then were entitled to teach without further training) has become mandatory
for all school teachers except, temporarily, mathematics and science teachers
in secondary schools. Such courses were at colleges of education and in uni¬
versity education departments.
Since August 1975, a basic reorganisation of the system of teacher training
in England and Wales has been started. All higher and further education out¬
side the universities including teacher training is being assimilated into a
common system under the control of local education authorities. A number of
the existing colleges of education have been merged either with each other or
with other colleges of further education to form ‘liberal arts’ colleges; some are
to discontinue completely the initial training of teachers. As the first move
towards a wholly graduate profession, three- and four-year degree courses in¬
corporating educational studies are being developed, although the three-year
certificate courses will also be maintained as long as they are needed.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. Courses in
colleges of education lead to the award of a Teaching Qualification (Primary
Education) or a Teaching Qualification (Secondary Education). Graduates and
holders of specialist diplomas undergo a one-year course; courses in practical
and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates extend to two, three or four years.
For primary teaching the course extends to one year for graduates and three for
non-graduates. Most Scottish colleges of education also offer four-year courses
leading to the degree of Bachelor of Education.
In Northern Ireland teacher training takes place in the two university edu¬
cation departments, three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one
technical college. The principal courses are three-year (certificate) and four-
year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also one-year courses for graduates or
holders of other appropriate qualifications.
The education departments, universities, local authorities and other bodies
provide a variety of short in-service training courses for practising teachers.

I55
In 1974-75 about 252,000 students, almost half of them full-time, were taking
advanced courses other than in universities and colleges of education in a wide
variety of subjects, including architecture, art and design, catering, engineer-
ing, natural sciences, social work and business and management studies. An
increasing proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the awards
of the Council for National Academic Awards. The council has power to
award degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in standard with
those granted by universities, to students who successfully complete approved
courses of study in establishments which do not have the power to award their
own degrees. In the academic year 1974-75 over 800 courses were being
followed by about 58,000 students. These courses ranged from science and
technology to the arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the pro¬
portion of technological, business or other explicitly vocational courses was
much higher than in universities and the proportion of arts, language and
science courses lower.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and the
former colleges of education is being concentrated within 30 major national in¬
stitutions named polytechnics’. They are comprehensive institutions providing
all types of courses (full-time, sandwich and part-time) on a wide range of
subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a concentration on advanced
level. In Scotland similar provision is made in 14 central institutions and a few
further education colleges managed by education authorities, though there is a
tendency for the Scottish establishments to specialise more by subjects than
do the English polytechnics. In Northern Ireland such higher education pro¬
vision is concentrated within the Ulster College.
The British educational systems offer facilities for obtaining all types of
vocational education and training and are notable for providing alternative
routes to higher qualifications for those who have found themselves unable to
continue full-time education after leaving school.
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of
up to five years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates
and Diplomas awarded by joint committees consisting of representatives of
education departments, teacher organisations and the appropriate professional
bodies. The Technician Education Council has responsibility for developing
a unified system of courses for technicians in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, leading to awards which will eventually replace those of the joint
committees. A similar council has been established in Scotland. Courses are
normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary National Certificate
(ONC) courses normally last two years part-time and students usually follow
them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the certificate is generally
considered to approach that of GCE ‘A’ level. The Ordinary National Diploma
(OND) courses are the full-time or sandwich counterparts of the ONC but
involve wider and deeper study. The Higher National Diploma (HND), which
requires a further two years’ full-time or three years’ sandwich study, is recog¬
nised, within its more restricted field, as approaching the standard of a pass
degree; the Higher National Certificate (HNC), after two further years’ part-
time study, is lower in standard because it is more narrowly based, but is
nevertheless classified as an advanced course.
Many further education colleges offer courses in shorthand, typing, book¬
keeping, and office studies. More advanced level work, however, is generally
concentrated in polytechnics or other colleges with a department of business
156

studies, notably those designated as regional centres of management education.
Courses for the post-experience postgraduate Diploma in Management
Studies are run by about 75 colleges; and some polytechnics run courses
leading to the Master’s degree of the Council for National Academic Awards.
Much business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; and courses leading to them are provided
in many further education colleges, although numbers of the candidates taking
such qualifications do so through correspondence courses. A Business Educa¬
tion Council was established in 1974 with the same functions as the Technician
Education Council (see above) in relation to courses of business education. In
Scotland, similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish
Higher National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business
Studies, awarded by the Scottish Business Education Council. Courses leading
to the certificate of business administration are provided for students in junior
administrative positions.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of post-school education
outside the main areas of higher, professional and technical education. In
1974 about 2-2 million people over the age of 18 attended such courses which
were provided by local education authorities, various voluntary and statutory
bodies, certain residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra-mural’)
departments of universities.
The residential colleges, the university departments and certain voluntary
bodies recognised as competent to provide adult education, receive government
grants. So do various national bodies which promote educational activities of a
non-political kind, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and
the National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations. Many of these
bodies also receive grants from local education authorities for services rendered
locally.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities and
provided mainly in their establishments, including schools (used for adult
evening classes). Most of the courses are part-time, and about 1-9 million
students attended such local authority adult education classes in 1973-74. In
addition local education authorities maintained or aided most of the short-term
residential colleges or centres, of which there are 33 in England and Wales,
and which provide courses varying in length between a weekend and a fort¬
night. Many of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities
for academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (six in England and Wales, one in Scotland)
which are grant-aided by the education departments, provide courses of one
or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges aim to provide
a liberal education and do not apply academic entry tests. Most students ad¬
mitted to them are entitled to full maintenance grants at mandatory rates. The
extra-mural departments of the universities and the Workers’ Educational
Association (WEA), the largest of the recognised voluntary bodies, provide ex¬
tended part-time courses of more academic studies, though recently there has
been a tendency for more short courses organised for special (including voca¬
tional) interests. Often the WEA provides the organisation and the teaching is
provided by the extra-mural departments, many of which have full-time staff
appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of other departments
of the university. In 1973-74 about 300,000 students attended such courses.
Similar work is promoted in some local education authority centres.
There are a large number of other organisations (both national and local,
EDUCATION

Learning and

some maintained or assisted and others commercially or privately financed)
which provide many kinds of education and training. Some make their facilities
available to the public as a whole, others to a particular group, such as the dis¬
abled or the unemployed, or the employees or members of an organisation.
A recent development has been the spread of community schools and col¬
leges and community centres. Community schools and colleges are secondary
schools planned to serve also as cultural community centres, providing educa¬
tional, social and cultural opportunities for the whole community. Community
centres have a more social character and, though aided financially by the local
education authorities, are usually managed by voluntary community associa¬
tions many of which are affiliated to the National Federation of Community
Associations.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations in Eng¬
land and Wales. It is mainly financed by contributions from local education
authorities and assisted by a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. The National Institute of Adult Education has created an Adult
Literacy Resource Agency to administer additional resources which the
Government is making available to assist local education authorities and other
organisations working to combat adult illiteracy. The Scottish Institute of
Adult Education and the Scottish Adult Literacy Resource Agency are the
corresponding bodies in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland extra-mural departments of the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the New University of Ulster organise and staff adult education
classes which are supplemented by classes organised by various non-official
bodies. The Workers’ Educational Association is responsible for classes at
other than university level and receives grants from the Department of Educa¬
tion and the education and library boards. The department has established a
Council for Continuing Education which will advise on the co-ordination of
the work being done and assist planning for the future.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses at universi¬
ties and colleges remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars or tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work. Nevertheless, each institution has different ways of preparing its course
material and different approaches and emphases in teaching it. They make
wide and varying use of the new teaching and learning aids provided by radio
and television and of other visual aids. Considerable use is also made of teaching
machines and language laboratories, and of computer-assisted and computer-
managed learning. Most universities and many colleges have closed television
circuits. All universities have ready access to computers for education as well as
research purposes and many have their own computers.
Radio and television programmes, both specially instructional and general,
are perhaps the most penetrating purveyors of adult education, and are often
linked to a range of supplementary publications and activities. Most BBC radio
study programmes are grouped in hourly sessions on five nights a week and
week-end afternoons. Television study programmes are shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and at midday and in the later evening on weekdays.
Both the BBC and Independent Television provide programmes at successive
intellectual levels from domestic, social and craft skills to progressive vocational
training. The BBC channels and production teams are also used to produce
radio and television programmes in support of Open University courses.

Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by the education departments,
local education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and
teachers’ associations. The Schools Council and the Social Science Research
Council are additional channels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and
Wales, an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities and from an annual grant from the Department of Education and
Science. There are also the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the
Northern Ireland Council for Educational Research.
Some research is undertaken at the former colleges of education, at poly¬
technics and by a few independent research organisations.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and some British teachers serve overseas
for a period.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer educational
ties with other member countries. Both at school level and in the colleges and
universities there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and
languages. Post-to-post exchanges of teachers have been encouraged by
government-sponsored schemes which are administered by the Central
Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. The bureau also makes appoint¬
ments available to European teachers wishing to teach in Britain and negotiates
posts on an in-service training basis for British teachers wishing to further
their experience in another European country. Britain has adhered to the
Statute of the European Schools (six of which have been established through¬
out the Community) to provide school education for children of people em¬
ployed in the European Community institutions. Negotiations are in progress
to promote recognition of professional qualifications which will enable qualified
people to practise anywhere in the Community.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1974-75 there were about 100,000 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about 28,000 were at universities, another 34,000 at technical
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, nurses, for
the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 46 per cent of all over¬
seas students were from the Commonwealth and about three-quarters were
from developing countries.
As part of British technical assistance to developing countries, the Ministry
of Overseas Development supports some 10,000 students with subsistence and
fees, encourages the development of special courses of particular value to
students from developing countries and of advisory and welfare services to
meet their needs.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from
other countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan,
the governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards avail¬
able at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from other
Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1975-76,

716 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. The Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme
provides opportunities for further training, study and research for teachers and
others with appropriate experience. In 1975-76 there were 600 study fellow¬
ships tenable for periods of between three months and three years.
About 590 British Council1 scholarships tenable usually for one year in
Britain, and 140 British Council Fellowships tenable for two to three years, are
offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Some 56 Marshall
Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are offered
annually by the British Government to graduates from the United States of
America. Over 70 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually *to graduates
from the Commonwealth, the United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany for two years of study at the University of Oxford. Other univer¬
sities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate
students of any nationality are eligible.2
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are available
under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the Special Com¬
monwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance pro¬
grammes for many countries. Over 1,400 awards for study or training in Britain
are also made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance
and by the United Nations specialised agencies such as UNESCO, FAO, and
WHO, and also under OECD and certain Council of Europe schemes.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held.
The Atlantic College at St. Donat’s, South Wales, provides two-year
residential courses for selected fee-paying pupils of different nationalities prior
to their entering university.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the British
Government in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students, and provides
certain services, such as meeting on arrival, introduction courses, an accom¬
modation bureau and a student centre in London which organises a varied
programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities and arranges
introductions of students to people who wish to invite them to their homes. In
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The council is governed by a board broadly representative of many elements
of British life, and including six members nominated by ministers. It is financed almost
entirely from public funds. The activities of the council, which has staff in 78 overseas
countries, are advising and assisting in English teaching and other educational work
including science, fostering personal contacts between British and overseas people,
especially in the educational, professional and scientific fields j running, or helping to
maintain, libraries of British books and periodicals overseas j and presenting overseas
British achievements and the arts. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with pro¬
fessional visitors and with the welfare of overseas students.
2 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes two handbooks Awards
for Commonwealth University Staff and Scholarships Guide for Commonwealth Post¬
graduate Students (see Bibliography p. 459) which include information about sources of
financial aid tenable in Britain. The association promotes co-operation between Com-
monwealth universities. Its activities include the provision of publication, information
and academic appointments services, and of secretariats for various bodies affecting its
member institutions, such as the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and the
Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission.
l6o BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the vacations there are courses in many parts of the country which offer oppor¬
tunities for getting to know more about British life in town and country. In
term time there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and concert
parties are arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are Rotary and Round Table clubs, the Victoria League, the Royal
Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union of
Students, the English-Speaking Union and churches of all denominations.
The United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, established in
1968, is an independent central body serving overseas students and organisa¬
tions and individuals concerned in overseas student affairs; it provides both a
forum for the exchange of ideas and machinery for consultation with govern¬
ment and other authorities. In many London boroughs and in other large cities
there are committees which help students to make contact with local residents
and organisations. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas stu¬
dents and many of them have established hostels with the financial help of the
Overseas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is administered by
the British Council. By the beginning of 1976 grants had been approved for
190 projects, providing places for about 6,000 students.
British Students In 1975-76 21 awards were accepted by British students in Commonwealth
Overseas countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (see
p. 158). In addition the Study and Serve Scheme, administered by the Inter-
University Council for Higher Education Overseas, enables British students
to spend two years in a developing country, the time being devoted equally to
study, which may or may not lead to a postgraduate qualification, and service,
usually in the form of university employment in the country concerned.
The United States-United Kingdom Educational Commission (still some¬
times called the Fulbright-Hays Commission) offers travel and maintenance
grants for postgraduate study in the United States. Notable among other
scholarships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study
at an American university, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and
women in all walks of life. British students are also offered scholarships at
institutions of higher education in many European and non-European coun¬
tries outside the Commonwealth.
Teachers
Serving
Overseas
Some 4,566 teachers were serving overseas in 1975, in schools, colleges of
education, technical colleges, universities, and as teacher trainers and educa¬
tional advisors in developing countries. Most of them were in Commonwealth
countries; almost all were supported by public funds. Recruitment is carried
out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the British Council and the
voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as Christians Abroad. Some devel¬
oping countries carry out their own recruitment of British teachers through
their offices in London.
During 1975 several hundred British teachers served in universities overseas,
most of them placed through the Inter-University Council for Higher Educa¬
tion Overseas, the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the British
Council. Government encouragement also includes support for a number of
schemes of assistance for overseas universities which are administered by the
Inter-University Council, including the scheme for Special Commonwealth
Awards, which are made to leading scholars from British universities who are
willing to work for a minimum of two years in important posts in the universi¬
ties of developing Commonwealth countries.

EDUCATION
Outside these schemes, four voluntary organisations, co-ordinated under the
British \ olunteer Programme (BVP), recruit graduate and qualified volunteers
for service overseas. Of the 1,915 overseas in 1975, 1,198 were teachers. The
BVP receives financial assistance from the Government.
Schemes under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year with
teachers overseas include one with the United States and another with Com¬
monwealth countries involving each year about*200 British teachers.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for assistants’ posts for language specialists.
The largest of these schemes is the modern languages assistants’ scheme,
administered by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges,
which enables students and young teachers to serve overseas, particularly in
Europe, and for their counterparts to serve in Britain.
Several schemes designed to assist interchange between institutions of higher
education in Britain and overseas countries through staff visits are adminis¬
tered by the British Council. Study and research visits by British and overseas
scholars are supported through programmes of the British Academy, the
Royal Society, the Science Research Council, and other British and inter¬
national bodies.
Britain provides assistance, on request, to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for specialist missions
and technical and consultant services. Areas of particular activity include the
introduction of new materials, methods and techniques. This assistance is
provided through various educational organisations, the Ministry of Overseas
Development and the British Council.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to help young people to broaden their interests,
to enjoy recreational pursuits, and to mix socially in their leisure time.
The service (which in Scotland forms part of the Youth and Community
Service) is provided by local education authorities and voluntary organisations,
in co-operation with the government education departments. Membership of
youth groups is voluntary and groups vary greatly in their activities, there
being no attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a
national youth movement.
Organised activities for young people were first promoted by voluntary bodies,
often of a religious nature, during the nineteenth century, and the number of
such organisations and the range of their activities have continued to grow
over the past 100 years. The involvement of local authorities and the education
departments in the youth service dates back principally to the 1940s when the
service first became recognised as part of the education system.
The education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievements through financial assistance and advice. They
make known the Government’s attitude by means of circulars to local education
authorities and through contacts between departmental officials and representa¬
tives of the authorities and the voluntary organisations. The Scottish Educa¬
tion Department is advised by a council representing both statutory and volun¬
tary bodies concerned in youth and community work, while in Northern Ireland
the advisory body is the Youth Committee for Northern Ireland.

Financially the education departments assist voluntary organisations through
grants towards their costs for central administration and building projects.
Local education authorities assist local voluntary groups by lending premises
and equipment and by contributing to their capital and running costs. Many
authorities also construct and run youth centres and clubs; in Great Britain
there are several thousand youth centres fully run by local education authori¬
ties. Most authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and
voluntary bodies are represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate
youth work in their areas and to arrange in-service training. In Scotland these
committees and organisers are normally concerned with services for both
young people and adults.
Although the number of local education authority youth clubs and centres
is growing, national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of
youth activities through local groups, which raise most of their day-to-day
running expenses by their own efforts; these have an estimated membership
of over 6 million. Some 50 national youth organisations and 42 local co-ordinat¬
ing bodies are full members of the National Council for Voluntary Youth
Services (NCVYS), a consultative body which takes action only in the name and
with the consent of its member bodies; a further 18 organisations are observers.
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are similar representative
bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations belonging to
NCVYS are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 600,000 and
800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (over 500,000),
the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (over 170,000) and the Youth Hostels
Association (about 276,000).
Certain pre-Service organisations for boys, which provide facilities for
social, educational and physical development along with training for possible
entry to the armed forces, are also members of NCVYS; they are assisted
financially by the Ministry of Defence.
Local education authority youth groups in England and Wales normally cater
for young people of both sexes mainly in the 14—20 age-range.
Some voluntary organisations cater for young people on a single-sex basis
and their membership often covers a wider age-range. An official survey
published in 1972 on the Youth Service and similar provision (see Bibliography
p. 461) showed that some two-thirds of young people aged 14-20 were members
of a club or association (including associations attached to schools, colleges and
universities, and places of work). The survey also indicated that 68 per cent or
more had at some time been members of a youth club. A smaller proportion of
girls than boys takes part in youth club activities and the main involvement is
between the ages of 14 and 20.
There are over 3,000 full-time youth workers in Great Britain and these are
supported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but
some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number
attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school teachers
are recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and com¬
munity workers. Provided at further education colleges, the course leads to
a professional qualification. In addition a number of colleges of education
provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject within

a teacher-training course. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are
provided by the Ulster College.
There are a number of organisations, which, although primarily concerned
with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people, operate in a con¬
text broader than that of any individual youth movement. Among the most
important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland (see p. 439)* which provide practical and advisory services for many
youth organisations; the National Playing Fields Association, which advises
local authorities and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout, construc¬
tion and use of sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust, which maintains
five schools in areas of outstanding natural beauty and offers full-time resi¬
dential courses designed to encourage a sense of adventure, responsibility,
confidence and achievement.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies
such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Some 200,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 25 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries took part in the scheme in 1975. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
The King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its
creation in 1935, has distributed more than £3-1 million in grants to voluntary
youth organisations and towards experimental youth projects.
The National Youth Bureau is a forum for association, discussion and joint
action for those concerned with the social education of young people. It pro¬
vides information services, training services and services to research and experi¬
ment including the maintenance of a research register. The bureau also has a
specialist information unit on social work with young people. In Scotland the
Board for Information in Youth and Community Service undertakes similar
functions.
There has been considerable growth in voluntary service by young people to
those in need in the community, for example, the elderly, the sick, the mentally
ill and the handicapped. Organisations such as International Voluntary Service,
Task Force and Community Service Volunteers receive grants from the
Government, and through them thousands of young people are doing full- or
part-time voluntary work for the community. Many schools organise com¬
munity service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Young Volunteer Force Foundation is an independent body which
advises interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving
young people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-
aided by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available
on request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in encouraging and promoting voluntary service. In Scotland,
a similar organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, exists to co-ordinate and promote
voluntary service to the community.
8 Planning and the
Environment
Development
Plans
Over many years successive British Governments have taken action to manage
and protect the environment, and have established a legal and administrative
framework, particularly of planning law, to control development, to reduce
pollution and to encourage positive planning to ensure the wise use of land.
The Department of the Environment (see p. 48) brings together the major
responsibilities for land use, planning, housing and construction, countryside
policy and environmental protection; all government departments in Great
Britain have a legal duty when exercising functions relating to land to keep in
mind the desirability of conserving the countryside’s natural beauty and
amenity.
The basis of the modern system of land use planning—derived from legis¬
lation passed in 1947—is contained in the Town and Country Planning Acts of
1971 (for England and Wales) and 1972 (for Scotland). There is a centralised
planning structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scot¬
land and Wales, and compulsory planning duties are imposed on all local
planning authorities. Large-scale strategic planning in England and Wales is
primarily the responsibility of the county councils and the Greater London
Council while district councils and the councils of the London boroughs and
the City of London are responsible for most local plans and development
control, the main housing functions and many other environmental health
matters. In certain areas of planning, the two types of authority exercise
concurrent powers. In Scotland, planning functions are undertaken by
regional and district councils whose responsibilities are divided on a basis
broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the more rural regions and
islands areas, all planning responsibilities are carried out by the regional and
islands councils respectively.
The Community Land Act of 1975 introduced a system under which
local authorities have new duties to consider the supply of land for develop¬
ment. Progressively, as resources are available, authorities will take on the
responsibility of supplying all land needed for private development. Under
associated tax legislation local authorities will buy development land at a
price net of the tax payable on its development value. A separate Land Authority
for Wales has been set up under the Act to assume in Wales the functions in
connection with acquisitions and disposals of development land carried out
in England and Scotland by local authorities.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which work closely
with the district councils and the local offices of the Housing Executive (see
p. 184). District councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
A new development plan system of structure and local plans was provided for
in legislation introduced in England and Wales in 1968. Structure plans are
prepared by county planning authorities and require ministerial approval.
Amenity
Societies
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT 165
They set out broad policies for the future use and development of land
(including measures for the improvement of the physical environment and
traffic management) and indicate ‘action areas’ where comprehensive develop¬
ment or improvement is expected to start within a specified period. Local
plans, which have to conform generally with the structure plan, contain
detailed proposals including plans for ‘action areas’ and are normally prepared
by district councils, though sometimes by county councils. Local plans are
adopted by the planning authorities without being subject to ministerial
approval unless the Secretary of State calls in a plan for his own decision.
All plans are under continuous review and may be altered periodically. A
similar planning system was introduced in Scotland in 1975.
Within the context of these plans local authorities exercise control over
particular proposals for development. With a few exceptions, all other develop¬
ment (which in planning law includes most forms of construction, engineering
and mining and any material change in the use of land or existing buildings)
can be carried out only after the local planning authority has given its per¬
mission.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. These public
participation requirements are additional to provisions for objecting to
prepared plans. In the case of structure plans the Secretary of State holds an
examination in public of matters on which he requires more information in
order to reach a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be
heard and a public local inquiry is normally held for this purpose. Where
specific proposals for development differ substantially from the intentions of
a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other schemes affecting
a large number of people are usually advertised by the local planning authority
and applications seeking permission for certain types of development must also
be advertised. There is a right of appeal to the appropriate Secretary of State
if planning permission is refused or granted subject to conditions; in England
some 72 per cent and in W ales 70 per cent of appeals are transferred to inspec¬
tors for decision (a similar system of delegation was introduced in Scotland in
i9?6). An appellant always has the right to put his case before an inspector
appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of
national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature and if an
ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may
decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and
hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the govern¬
ment minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he considers appropriate.
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and North¬
ern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and
has over 580,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns and protects
166

from harmful development 430,000 acres (174,000 hectares) of land, 200
historic buildings and large stretches of coastline. Properties in Scotland
covering some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) are protected by the National
Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded in 1931, which has over
70,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning in Britain, and helped to pro¬
mote, for example, the first new towns legislation. The Civic Trust, estab¬
lished in 1957, encourages higher standards in architecture and planning and
makes annual awards for good developments of all kinds. It supports and
advises over 1,200 amenity societies. Associate trusts exist in Scotland, Wales
and the north-east and north-west of England.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers’
Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Ancient
Monuments Society; the Georgian Group and the Scottish Georgian Society;
the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim
Trust; the Council for British Archaeology and the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust. The Committee for Environmental Conservation, com¬
prising many of the main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is
concerned with broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual
societies. In Wales, the Prince of Wales Committee promotes projects to
improve the environment and encourages a greater awareness of environ¬
mental problems.
Economic planning councils (see p. 192) in each region of England and Wales,
together with economic planning boards and local planning authorities,
jointly sponsor the preparation of regional strategies. These are intended to
advise the Government on the long-term development of particular regions
and to provide a framework for the preparation of structure plans by county
councils. In Scotland, regional reports are prepared and submitted for
comment to the Secretary of State by the regional councils after consultation
with the district councils.
The Location Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
of Industry measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p. 214). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires
the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives from the Govern¬
ment encourage the location of industry in particular areas.
New Towns In Great Britain the New Towns Act 1946, later consolidated in Acts of 1965
and 1968, gives the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and
Wales power to designate any area of land (which may include an existing
centre of population) as the site of a new town. The New Towns Act (Northern
Ireland) 1965 makes similar provision for Northern Ireland.
The appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned and
allow the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. A
development corporation is appointed by the Government to create and plan
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
167
the growth of the town. It is responsible for the master plan, which is pre¬
pared in consultation with the appropriate minister, government departments,
and the local authorities in the area. Residents are given an opportunity to state
their views and, if necessary, a public inquiry is held. When the plan has been
agreed, the development corporation draws up detailed proposals for parti¬
cular areas, based on the master plan, and submits them to the responsible
minister for approval which (given after consultation with the local planning
authorities) constitutes planning permission. A development corporation has
general powers to acquire by agreement or compulsory purchase any land or
property within the designated area necessary for its purposes, and is em¬
powered to provide houses, offices, factories and other essential buildings,
estate roads and, in certain circumstances, the main services essential to the
development of the town.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced from public funds
and is repayable over 60 years. Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament
approved a fund of £50 million to provide for advances to the development
corporations for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subse¬
quent Acts and now stands at j£i,750 rnillion, but may be further increased,
by an Order made by the Secretary of State, to a sum not exceeding £2,250
million. A total of ^1,721 million had been advanced by 31st March 1976.
The corporations submit annual reports (which include copies of their audited
accounts) to Parliament.
Of the 29 new towns1 designated in Great Britain since 1946, 21 are in
England, two in Wales and six in Scotland. Eleven of the new towns in England
(Basildon, Bracknell, Crawley, Harlow, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Milton
Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough, Stevenage and Welwyn) are designed
to help to relieve housing problems in the Greater London area. Of the others,
Aycliffe, Corby, Peterlee and Washington are serving the special needs of
their areas; Runcorn and Skelmersdale' are helping to meet the overspill
needs of Liverpool and north Merseyside; Telford and Redditch are taking
population from Birmingham and the West Midlands conurbation; and
Warrington aims to attract people from the Liverpool and Manchester areas.
Central Lancashire New Town has been designated to ease further the
housing problems of Liverpool and Manchester and to provide a growth
point for the region’s economy.
In Mid-Wales, Newtown is being developed to promote growth and to
stem depopulation, whereas Cwmbran in South Wales is serving the needs of
local industry.
The Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glenrothes,
Irvine, Livingston and Stonehouse1) are helping to relieve congestion in the
Glasgow conurbation and are major growth areas in the central belt of Scot¬
land. In Northern Ireland responsibility for the former new towns (Antrim,
Ballymena, Craigavon and Londonderry) now rests, through its Develop¬
ment Offices, with the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Four new towns (Crawley, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn) have
been substantially completed and are now the responsibility of the Com¬
mission for the New Towns, a government-appointed agency.
The population of the new towns in Great Britain is about 1-9 million.
Since the start of the new towns programme in the late 1940s, over 900,000
people have moved to live in them. Young people form a higher proportion

of new town populations than of the country as a whole. An extensive build¬
ing and civil engineering programme has provided houses, flats, factories,
schools, shops, churches, health centres and libraries as well as public build¬
ings including town halls and law courts. Roads, water supplies, sewerage,
gas and electricity, police, fire and bus stations, postal, telegraph and tele¬
phone facilities have also been provided; most of the towns are well equipped
with parks and sports facilities of various kinds. All the new towns have become
concerned with the increasingly high level of car ownership and are making
more adequate provision for parking and the segregation of pedestrians from
motorists; a few are creating special facilities for different modes of trans¬
port, for example, roads for bicycles or buses only.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and,
as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices,
hotels and department stores, as well as arts centres and full entertainment and
recreational facilities (skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools, sports stadia, golf courses and youth centres) are gradually being pro¬
vided. The expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton, Peter¬
borough and Warrington has the advantage, among others, that many of these
facilities are already available.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They
are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments,
both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.1
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large cities in England and Wales (such as London and Birmingham) by
encouraging the transfer of population, and industry where necessary, to
areas suitable for expansion. Schemes have been approved, providing some
163,000 dwellings in this way, of which about half have been built. Most of the
expanding towns (for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and Thet-
ford) are well established and are providing homes, jobs and amenities for
people from large cities. The Housing and Town Development (Scotland)
Act 1957 makes similar provision for Scotland, where the only congested
area so far involved is Glasgow.
Urban Existing towns and cities1 are being renewed and re-shaped to improve the
Renewal environment and to meet the growth in population and traffic. Local authori¬
ties have extensive powers (often aided by government grants) to clear slum
dwellings, to improve individual houses or whole residential areas, to reclaim
derelict land, to secure clean air and to manage traffic. Studies of six urban
areas in England have been undertaken by the Department of the Environment
and local authorities to emphasise an integrated approach to urban problems.
Three of the studies were concerned with the problems of industrial towns.
The other three studies are investigating those of ‘inner city’ areas, in particular
the nature of ‘urban deprivation’ and ways of dealing with it.
Research into urban planning problems is also undertaken by a number of
institutes and university departments and by the Centre for Environmental
Studies, which is financed jointly by the Government and other sources, in¬
cluding the Ford Foundation.
1 In a policy statement in September 1976 the Secretary of State for the Environment
announced the Government’s intention to review the future role of the new and expand¬
ing towns and future policies on population dispersal in the light of the need to attract
industrial and residential development back to inner city areas.

Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; over 250,000 buildings
are already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England) and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales have an opportunity to make a photographic
record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation notices’ can be
served by the local planning authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the appropriate
Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the repair or main¬
tenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding interest, and local
authorities can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or
historic interest even if it is not listed. Over 3,300 buildings in Great Britain
have received grants and loans totalling some £15 million under the Historic
Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953. Local planning authorities
have designated for special protection over 4,000 ‘conservation areas’ of
particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and loans are also available
under the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 1972 for works
for the preservation or enhancement of conservation areas designated as
outstanding. Studies have been made in Bath, Chester, Chichester and York
of the difficulties of preserving features of historic interest in ancient towns
in the face of commercial development and increasing motor traffic. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are responsible
for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protection of
ancient monuments of which about 800 are in their care. Some 15-3 million
people visited them in 1975. The Ancient Monument Boards for England,
Scotland and Wales recommend to the respective Secretaries of State which
monuments are considered to be of national importance and therefore worthy
of preservation. In Northern Ireland 138 historic monuments are maintained
and protected by the state, and there is planning legislation on the listing of
buildings of special architectural or historic interest (over 1,000 have been
listed since work started in 1974). Grants for repairs and maintenance are
made by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, which is also
responsible for the designation of ‘conservation areas’.
During European Architectural Heritage Year 1975 more than 1,300 projects
of restoration and rehabilitation were undertaken in Britain and there was a
net gain of more than 19,000 listed buildings. A government-supported
Architectural Heritage Fund was established to provide loans for local
historic building trusts. Additionally, £180,000 was set aside for projects of
enhancement and preservation in non-outstanding conservation areas and a
further £150,000 is being made available for this purpose in 1976-77.
The local planning authorities have power to preserve trees and woodlands
in the interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders; when granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must,
wherever appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting
of trees; and landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’ trees,
which die or are removed or destroyed.

character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where people can seek recreation) have been established or
proposed around all or part of certain urban areas. About three-quarters of
London’s green belt is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be
used for recreation. There are also country parks, public open spaces, playing
fields and golf courses specifically for recreational use. In Scotland there are
green belt areas around the main cities.

Commissions
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast, for example, providing recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coasTs natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of
scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales was under¬
taken by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70 which recommended that
certain stretches of underdeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Policies for these areas are being incorporated in the
planning authorities’ structure and local plans.
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to
raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. Nearly £3 million has been raised so far and
as a result the National Trust has brought under its protection over 360
miles (580 kilometres) of coastline in England and Wales. Over 70 miles
(112 kilometres) of coast in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements
with the National Trust for Scotland; and to deal with the planning questions
raised by oil-related developments the Secretary of State for Scotland has
issued coastal planning guidelines.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment and the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and
heavy costs for the maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection
schemes drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949
are investigated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from
central funds (up to a maximum of 80 per cent) may be made to the authorities.
Protection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the
responsibility of the water authorities (see p. 288). To help to prevent the
pollution of the sea and coastline, international conventions restrict the dis¬
charge of oil into the sea (see p. 175).
The display of outdoor advertisements 'is controlled by planning legislation.
General consents have been issued for certain classes of advertisement but
these can be withdrawn in particular cases where there is a serious threat to
amenity or public safety. Consent for advertisements outside these classes
must be sought from the local planning authority. Rural areas and urban
areas requiring special protection can be designated as areas of special contro
which may impose more restrictive standards.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) encourage the development of facilities for open-air recreation in
the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (some¬
times in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country
parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
National Parks
171
areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. By 1976, 126 country parks and 155 picnic
sites had been recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Com¬
mission. In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the provision
of a variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant aid. The
Countryside Commission for Scotland has approved six country parks.
The commissions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting
measures to conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside and may undertake research projects and experimental schemes,
working in consultation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 172) and the Sports Councils (see p. 439). In
England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may give financial assistance
to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and
amenity projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation
of long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover some 5,250 square miles (13,600
sq km), or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is
based on local authority representation, with a third of the members appointed
by the Government. By 1976 33 areas of outstanding natural beauty had been
designated, covering some 5,600 square miles (14,500 sq km).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and
the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit
of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas,
and information centres. All national parks and some other designated areas
have warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national parks
is met by central government grants. Some 1,500 miles (2,414 km) of long¬
distance footpaths and bridleways had been approved by 1976. Large stretches
of these paths are already public rights of way. A number of the routes are
open and further routes are being established.
Under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 the Ulster Country¬
side Committee advises on the establishment of national parks and the designa¬
tion of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas have been designated.
Thirteen amenity areas, acquired by the Northern Ireland Department of
the Environment, are being managed as country parks. Although there are
no national parks as such in Scotland, there are five national park direction
areas, within which all planning applications are subject to scrutiny by the
Secretary of State. The areas are: Loch Lomond-Trossachs; Glen Affric-
Glen Cannich-Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis-Glencoe-Black Mount; the Cairn¬
gorms; and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch Broom. Ministerial
supervision, with the advice of the Countryside Commission for Scotland, is
exercised over planning permission in ‘areas of special planning control’ which
are areas of particular beauty, designated as such by the Secretary of State.

One such area forms part of the Pentland Hills to the south of Edinburgh.
Over 98 per cent of the land in Scotland has been designated as countryside
within the jurisdiction of the Countryside Commission for Scotland.
The Forestry Commission (see p. 297) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. Camping and other recreational facilities are provided
in all the parks. The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a
forest park, is also open to the public. The parks and the New Forest together
cover some 491,000 acres (196,000 hectares). In addition, the Forestry Com¬
mission welcomes the public to many parts of the 3 million acres (i*2 million
hectares) under its. management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of
Agriculture has established five forest parks (Tollymore, Castlewellan,
Gortin Glen, Drum Manor and Gosford) and there are also five forest
scenic drives; in some 50 forests recreational facilities have been provided.
Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 county
councils in most areas of England and Wales have prepared maps showing all
public rights of way, which must be kept free of obstructions and properly
maintained. If a path is not shown on the map, a private citizen can show
that it is a public right of way if it has been used and regarded as such without
interruption for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are maintained by local
highway authorities who must also provide signposts and supervise the duty
of landowners to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths and ways, close existing paths which are no longer in public
use, and divert paths to secure a more efficient use of the land or simply a
shorter route. Local planning authorities can convert minor roads into foot¬
paths or bridleways and provide recreational facilities.
The 1949 Act is also concerned with access to open country, which includes
mountains, moors, heaths, downs, cliffs and foreshores, woodlands, rivers
and canals and their banks, but not farmland unless it is used for grazing.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, but local
planning authorities can secure access by means of agreements with land-
owners; if agreements cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or
make orders for public access. These powers have been extended to Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 1-5 million acres (600,000 hectares) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
1965 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens. Under
the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities for enjoyment
on any common land to which the public has access.
The Nature Conservancy Council is the official body responsible for nature
conservation in Great Britain. By May 1976 there were 151 national nature
reserves, covering 296,000 acres (120,000 hectares). Over 40 nature reserves
are run by local authorities; in woodland areas there are nine forest nature
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Land
Reclamation
i?3
reserves; in addition a number of reserves have been established by voluntary
bodies. There are also 3,500 sites of special scientific interest in Great Britain,
notified because of their flora, fauna or geological or physiological features:
local planning authorities must consult the Nature Conservancy Council
before granting planning permission for development affecting them. In
Northern Ireland over 30 nature reserves have been established by the Northern
Ireland Department of the Environment on the advice of the Nature Reserves
Committee.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations co-operate in the conservation
of nature (and in many cases establish their own reserves or other specially
protected areas). These include: the National Trust, the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the
County Naturalists Trusts and the Council for Nature (which consists of
some 350 natural history and conservation societies).
Local authorities, and in Scotland and Wales the newly formed Development
Agencies (see p. 211), bear the main responsibility for reclaiming land so
damaged by industrial or other development that it is incapable of beneficial
use. Local planning authorities have powers for reclaiming land in pursuit of
the general well-being of their districts—for example, in the course of
providing open spaces and schools; they can acquire and develop land and
carry out restoration and improvement; and they can require an owner of
land which is damaging and offensive to the surrounding area to improve
its condition. Exchequer grants are available to cover half the cost of individual
restoration schemes, higher grants being available for clearance of dereliction
in the designated areas (see map, p. 209) and in national parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty.
New arrangements were introduced in December 1975 under which the
entire net cost of derelict land reclamation in the designated areas is met from
the Exchequer. In Scotland and Wales responsibility for financing and
implementing reclamation schemes has been transferred to the Development
Agencies. In England responsibility for the clearance of dereliction remains
with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment continues
to administer government financial assistance and provides central informa¬
tion and advice.
Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that, when
permission is granted for mineral working, various measures are required to
minimise the disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restora¬
tion is practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of
land for tipping is also subject to conditions restricting height or requiring
treatment on completion.
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
Responsibility for the control of environmental pollution is shared by central
government departments, local authorities, water authorities and the Scottish
river purification boards. Industry co-operates with these authorities and
voluntary organisations help to focus public interest on the process of control.
An independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution,
set up in 1970, advises the Government on national and international matters
concerning the pollution of the environment, on the adequacy of research
(see p. 398) and on the future possibilities of danger to the environment.
The commission has so far published five reports.

The Land
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Secretary of State for the Environment has a general co-ordinating
role concerning pollution matters as a whole, exercised through a Central
Unit on Environmental Pollution within his department. Specific responsibili¬
ties of the Department of the Environment in England include air pollution
control, fresh water pollution control, waste disposal, control of radioactive
wastes, of oil on beaches and of noise other than aircraft noise and noise in
the workplace. Most of these responsibilities in Scotland are exercised by
the Scottish Development Department, in Wales by the Welsh Office and in
Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the control of oil pollution at
sea and of aircraft noise. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland and the Northern
Ireland Department of Agriculture are responsible for the control of agri¬
cultural chemicals such as pesticides, for the protection of fisheries from
pollution and for the prevention of food pollution. Pollution arising within
factories is the responsibility in Great Britain of the Department of Employ¬
ment and is controlled by HM Factory Inspectorate which forms part of the
Health and Safety Executive (see p. 345); in Northern Ireland it is the responsi¬
bility of the Department of Manpower Services. Other departments such as
the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and
Social Security and the Scottish Home and Health Department have an
interest in health aspects of pollution control.
Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and disposal
of domestic wastes; sewerage and sewage treatment and disposal; control
of air pollution from domestic and certain industrial premises and noise
abatement measures. The regional water authorities in England, the Welsh
National Water Development Authority in Wales, the river purification
boards and islands councils in Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department
of the Environment are responsible for control of water pollution.
The European Community has adopted a programme of environmental
improvement for which decisions are taken by Community Environment
Ministers.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974 is a major legislative measure extending
earlier statutory provisions dealing with certain aspects of public health and
pollution control in Great Britain; these relate particularly to waste on land,
including waste collection and disposal, pollution of inland and coastal waters,
noise and pollution of the atmosphere. The Act also increases the penalties
for a large number of pollution offences. It is, as yet, only partly in operation.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the deposit or dumping of waste
materials of all kinds in tips or elsewhere, application of pesticides and
chemicals, fall-out of materials from the atmosphere and the deposition of
materials from floodwater. The Control of Pollution Act 1974 will* when
fully implemented, lay a duty on the waste disposal authorities (the councils
of counties in England, of districts in Wales and of districts and islands in
Scotland) to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made for the disposal
of all ‘controlled waste’. It also makes special provision for regulations govern¬
ing the disposal of dangerous waste. Contravention of any such regulations or
of the licensing system is subject to penalty.
The non-statutory Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme ensures that new
pesticides intended for use in agriculture and gardens, forestry and food
storage, or new methods of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until

enough experimental work has been done on their possible hazards (including
those to users, consumers of treated produce, livestock or domestic animals
and wild life) to allow the Government to make recommendations for their
safe use. A key role in the administration of the safety scheme is played by
the Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic
Chemicals which reviews all risks that may arise from the use of pesticides.
Under the Litter Act 1958 and the Dangerous Litter Act 1971 it is an offence,
subject to a fine of up to j£ioo, to leave litter on land in the open air to which
the public have free access. Under the Civic Amenities Act 1967 the deliberate
dumping of rubbish attracts a similar maximum fine with the possibility of a
£200 fine and three months’ imprisonment for subsequent offences.
Recycling and reclamation of waste materials is undertaken both to reduce
pollution and to help in the conservation and re-use of scarce resources. It
is estimated that materials to the value of over £1,500 million are reclaimed
annually. The Government has a Waste Management Advisory Council
which is looking at possibilities for extending reclamation and reducing waste.
There is extensive government research and development on such aspects
as mechanical sorting plants. The Department of Industry has a Waste
Materials Exchange which brings together producers and possible users of
industrial wastes beyond obvious categories such as scrap. The waste disposal
authorities already have powers under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 to
undertake the recycling of waste materials and are responsible for operating
a licensing system for waste disposal facilities.
The general provisions of the Food and Drugs Acts (see p. 136) make it
illegal to sell food which is injurious to health, not of the nature, substance or
quality demanded, or unfit for human consumption. Expert committees of
the agriculture, food and health departments periodically review regulations
dealing with food, including contaminants.
The water authorities and the Scottish river purification authorities (see pp. 273
and 274) are responsible for the control of pollution in rivers and certain tidal
water in their areas, and their approval must be sought before effluents are
discharged. The Government’s aim is to improve the quality of water in all
the main rivers by the early 1980s. The River Pollution Survey and the Scottish
report, Towards Cleaner Water, 1975, record in detail progress made in
reducing river pollution. (As a result of pollution control policies, the Thames
is now believed to be one of the cleanest metropolitan estuaries in the world).
The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
The United Kingdom is a party to the International Convention for the
Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954, as amended in 1962.
Amendments to the convention agreed upon in 1969 prohibit the discharge
of persistent oil or mixtures containing any oil anywhere at sea except at a
rate which has been shown not to cause harmful pollution; no oil whatever
may be discharged from cargo spaces of tankers within 50 miles (80 kilo¬
metres) of land. The 1969 amendments are not yet in force, but Britain already
enforces these restrictions on United Kingdom registered ships through the
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, administered in respect of ships by the
Department of Trade. The Act also covers discharges of oil, or mixtures of
oil, arising from the development of offshore oil and it was amended in 1975
to allow certain exemptions to be made in respect of off-shore installations and
176

associated onshore terminals. This part of the Act is administered by the
Department of Energy. The Department of Trade and coastal local authorities
are equipped to deal with oil spills which, threaten or cause coastal pollution
or are likely to endanger wildlife.
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
1973 will, when in force, replace the 1954 convention (see p. 175) by more
stringent requirements and will regulate pollution by chemicals, sewage and
garbage as well as by oil.
The loading of wastes for dumping at sea by means of vehicles, ships,
aircraft, hovercraft, marine platforms and conveyor belts is controlled by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the appropriate departments
in Scotland and Northern Ireland, through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974,
which gave statutory backing to voluntary arrangements which had been
operated for several years. Under the Act a licence has to be obtained for the
permanent deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea.
Dumping at sea is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the
annexes to the Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention
of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the
London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of
Wastes and Other Matter 1972. The Act does not, however, control discharges
of liquid effluent from pipelines, which will be covered by the Control of
Pollution Act 1974 when fully implemented, nor discharge incidental to or
derived from the normal operation of a ship, aircraft, hovercraft or marine
structure.
Clean Air Responsibility for clean air in towns and cities rests with local authorities
who may, under the provisions of the Clean Air Acts 195^ ^nd 1968, declare
‘smoke control areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence; over half the premises in the conurbations are now
covered by smoke control orders. Central government is responsible through
the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive
(the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland) for controlling certain
industrial processes which give rise to particularly dangerous or offensive
emissions or which are technically difficult to control. The Clean Air Council
(set up in 1956) and a similar council for Scotland review the progress made
in abating air pollution in Great Britain. (London no longer experiences
dense fogs or serious smogs and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by 70 per cent since 1958. Similar improvement has been achieved
in other cities such as Glasgow.) Emissions from motor vehicles are separately
controlled by regulations.
Noise Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of noise control
and are required to inspect their areas for noise nuisances and to take action
(which can be enforced by the courts) to secure abatement. Measures against
noise, based on recommendations of the Noise Advisory Council (set up in
1970), were included in the Control of Pollution Act I974- This improved
and strengthened local authorities’ existing powers and enabled them to set
up ‘noise abatement zones’ within which they can require noise levels to be
held constant or reduced and within which noise levels may not be increased
without their permission. The Act contained special provisions to control
noise from construction and demolition sites. There are also regulations
governing maximum noise emissions by motor vehicles and various noise
abatement measures are in force at airports, including the stipulation of maxi-

mum noise levels at take-off, routeing flights away from densely populated
areas and restrictions on night movement of jet aircraft. New subsonic aircraft
are required to satisfy noise criteria agreed by the International Civil Aviation
Organisation. {Concorde aircraft, see p. 320, are exempted from the statutory
noise limits at London’s Heathrow Airport, but revised operational pro¬
cedures are being introduced which should result in a reduction in the noise
experienced in the vicinity of the airport.) Where airports or new public
works such as roads cause unacceptably high levels of noise, powers exist to
provide insulation for houses.
In Britain radiation exposure of the population resulting from industrial
and other processes represents only a small fraction of that to which the
population is exposed from the natural environment. Nevertheless, that
fraction is subject to stringent control because of possible effects on health
or longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive Substances Act i960
users of radioactive materials other than those subject to licence under the
Nuclear Installations Acts (see below) are required to be registered by the
Secretary of State for the Environment. Authorisation under the i960 Act
is also required for the disposal of radioactive waste from all premises. Very
minor uses and disposals of waste are exempted from the i960 Act controls.
Comparable controls are exercised by the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The responsibility for granting site licences for
nuclear installations under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and subsequent
Acts rests with the Health and Safety Executive (see p. 345) to which the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate was transferred in 1974. Conditions
attaching to site licences ensure, among other things, an efficient system for
detecting and recording ionising radiations and adequate measures for
treatment and disposal of nuclear wastes and irradiated nuclear fuel.
Control of the disposal of radioactive wastes from sites operated by the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and from sites licensed under the
Nuclear Installations Acts is exercised jointly in England by the Secretary of
State for the Environment and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food; in Wales jointly by the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food; in Scotland by the Secretary of State; while in
Northern Ireland, should future developments involve the application of the
Radioactive Substances Act i960, the Secretary of State would be responsible.
The National Radiological Protection Board (see p. 398) established
under the Radiological Protection Act 197° provides an authoritative point
of reference on radiological protection and represents British interests
internationally.
9 Housing
There are over 20 million dwellings in Britain: nearly 17 million in England,
1 million in Wales, 1-9 million in Scotland and nearly 500,000 in Northern
Ireland. Nationally, the numbers of households and dwellings are about
equal, but they are unevenly distributed or the houses available may not be
the type in demand. Housing shortages persist in the more prosperous
commercial and industrial centres such as London and Birmingham.
Some 78 per cent of households in Great Britain occupied a whole house
according to the 1973 General Household Survey, 21 per cent lived in flats
including some in maisonettes or rooms, and the rest in accommodation
rented with business premises or mobile homes such as caravans.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, some 31 per cent
are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are
rented from private landlords. There are variations, however, in the distribu¬
tion of tenure between the different countries of Britain—in Scotland more
than half the dwellings are rented from public authorities—and in different
regions and areas of those countries. Private rented accommodation is
generally more common in the central districts of large towns, while owner-
occupation is more frequent in their outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction in Britain is undertaken by both public and private
sectors. Of the 320,700 dwellings completed in 1975 some 48 per cent was
provided by private interests, about 48 per cent by public authorities, and
nearly 5 per cent by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public
housing authorities provide dwellings mainly for renting while private
interests build mainly for sale to owner-occupiers. The construction of private
dwellings to rent has dwindled to a very low level.
Over 8-8 million new dwellings have been built in Britain since 1945 an<^
more than two families in every five now live in a post-war dwelling. There
remain a large number of older dwellings, some of which have been kept in
good repair and modernised, but many others—particularly in the centres of
cities—are unsatisfactory by modern standards. The demolition of slum
dwellings, improvement of sub-standard houses and more advanced standards
for new house-building (particularly in the public sector) have led to signifi¬
cant improvements in the quality of British housing.
Administration Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England
and by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
In Great Britain most of the public housing is provided by 459 local
housing authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of
housing in their areas is adequate. These are: in England and Wales (outside
London) the district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the
London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London;
and in Scotland, the district and islands councils. Other public housing
authorities in Great Britain are the new town authorities (see p. 166) and the
Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA), which was established in 1937
to supplement building by local authorities in Scotland.

The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced by the local
authorities. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
Besides providing public housing, local authorities are involved in many
other aspects of housing policy, including paying house renovation grants
to the private sector, granting mortgages to owner-occupiers and carrying
out slum-clearance and redevelopment programmes. A growing number are
establishing housing advisory centres to provide information on most aspects
of housing. Local authority social services departments and, in England and
Wales, housing departments arrange accommodation for homeless people.
The main objectives of government housing policy are to secure a decent home
for every family at a price within its means, and to ensure fairness between
one citizen and another in giving and receiving help towards housing costs.
Government subsidies are available to assist local authorities with the cost of
clearing slums and providing adequate public sector housing. The Govern¬
ment is concerned to ensure that best use is made of the existing housing
stock and subsidies are also available for the improvement of older houses.
Special emphasis is being placed on gradual renewal rather than clear¬
ance, on building for smaller households to match the changing demographic
pattern and on providing for the needs of the worst housing areas.
Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the social,
economic and design aspects of housing, is undertaken within the Depart¬
ment of the Environment, under the control of the Director General of
Research. It is carried out by the Building Research Establishment and the
department’s directorates of economics, statistics, and housing development.
The Research and Development Group of the Scottish Development Depart¬
ment also undertakes research. Sponsored work is carried out in universities
and local authorities may also have housing research programmes. The
Government is advised on the need for, and application of, research and
development by the Construction and Housing Research Advisory Council.
Advice on ways of increasing productivity in house-building is also provided
by the National Building Agency.
Public housing authorities in Britain own some 6-4 million houses and flats
and in 1975 completed over 159,000 new dwellings. The number of houses
owned by each authority varies widely, some having a stock of well over 100,000
houses. In 1974 the Government authorised additional public expenditure
on housing to enable authorities to increase their building programme.
However, as part of the cuts in public expenditure announced in July 1976
(see p. 193) controls are to be introduced in April 1977 to limit the rate of
approvals for new house building by local authorities. Reductions will not be
made in areas where housing needs are greatest. A start has also been made
on programmes for municipal ownership of privately rented housing in the
worst areas of housing stress.
Local authorities in Great Britain meet the capital costs of new house con¬
struction by raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public
\\ orks Loan Board (see p. 69). Current expenditure, including maintenance
and management costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents,
l8o BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
supplemented by subsidies from the Exchequer and (particularly in Scotland)
from the rates. Subsidies for public housing in 1975-76 totalled an estimated
£840 million in England and Wales and about £142 million (excluding
SSHA subsidies of some £11 million) in Scotland.
The Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 and the Housing Rents and
Subsidies (Scotland) Act 1975 introduced certain changes in the system of
rent fixing for public sector housing and in England and Wales a new housing
subsidy system. Local authorities are required to charge their tenants reason¬
able rents—which keep a balance between the interests of tenants and rate¬
payers—without making a profit. Under the new subsidy system most of the
help goes to new building, acquisition of land and housing and improvement
of existing stock. In Scotland certain changes were made in the existing
subsidy system, providing increased support for housing expenditure.
Supplementary subsidies are available to assist local authorities throughout
Great Britain with slum clearance. In addition, there is a national system of
rent rebates and allowances which assists poorer tenants in meeting rents of
accommodation suited to their needs. Payments are made by local authorities
and financed largely by government subsidy.
Tenants In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate houses according to their own schemes. Authori¬
ties normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants (outside priority
categories) in order of application; some require applicants to fulfil residence
qualifications before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Although a number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses, most
building is undertaken by private firms under contract. Some authorities work
in consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, one or two living rooms and a kitchen, bath¬
room and lavatory. In England and Wales in 1974 some 91 per cent of new
dwellings had central heating and houses built for families of five people had
an average floor space of 958 square feet (89 square metres) and cost an
average of about £7,300 to build.
In 1975 over 153,000 private sector dwellings were completed in Britain,
almost all of which were intended for owner-occupation. The number of
people owning their own houses has more than doubled in the last 20 years,
and the 10-7 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain now account for over
half of the total housing stock.
Mortgage Loans Loans to enable people to buy their own houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies (see also p. 365) are the most important of these agencies.
They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term loans on the
security of property bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up
to 80 per cent of their valuation of a house but it is possible to borrow up to
95 per cent, or in rare cases, 100 per cent. Loans are normally repayable over
periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain circumstances) by

equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. A scheme intro¬
duced in May 1975 enables people buying homes for the first time (subject
to certain conditions) to defer part of their mortgage payments in the first
five years until the eleventh and subsequent years. The average price in
Britain of new houses mortgaged to building societies in 1975 was £12,000;
new houses in London and the south-east of England cost some 30 per cent
more than the national average. In 1975 the societies advanced some £4,965
million. As a result of policy decisions announced in July 1976, local authority
mortgage lending, which amounted in 1975 to £636 million in England and
Wales, will be reduced from April i977< The building societies have expressed
willingness to help fill the gap.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments
on loans related to their principal private residences, and in 1975-76 this
amounted to about £865 million. An alternative form of assistance—the option
mortgage scheme designed to help those with smaller incomes was intro¬
duced in 1968. Under the scheme, borrowers receive, through the lending
agency, a subsidy (instead of tax relief) which reduces the rate of mortgage
interest which they pay by up to 5-2 per cent. Subsidy payments under the
option mortgage scheme in Great Britain amounted in 1975-76 to about £106
million. Associated with the scheme is the option mortgage guarantee scheme,
whereby mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the valuation of a house (not
exceeding £12,000) may be made to those participating.
For building in the private sector the National House Building Council
(NHBC) sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the council’s scheme which
carries a ten-year guarantee against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not
grant mortgages on a new house unless it is covered by a NHBC certificate.
During the last quarter of a century there has been a steady decline in Great
Housing Britain in the number of rented dwellings available from private landlords
(including tied accommodation)—from nearly 52 per cent of the housing
stock in 1951 to about 16 per cent (3-2 million) in 1975. Major factors in
this decline have been the increased demand for owner-occupation, the
greater availability of public rented housing, and the operation of rent
restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of Britain’s
older housing with most landlords being individuals with limited holdings;
some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including
property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants
have a wide degree of security of tenure, and eviction from any dwelling (with¬
out a court order) and harassment of occupiers are serious offences.
Rent restriction can take three forms: rent control, rent regulation and
the fixing of a reasonable rent by a rent tribunal. Rent control applies to
dwellings of low rateable value in which the tenant has lived continuously
since before 1957- Tenants of controlled dwellings pay fixed rents deter¬
mined by reference to 1956 rateable values or, in Scotland, to historic rent
levels. These are very low by comparison with other rents, but they can be
increased to reflect expenditure on improvements and repairs. Landlords of
controlled dwellings whose houses reach a satisfactory standard are able to
transfer them to the alternative system of rent regulation.

I§2 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Rent regulation was introduced under the Rent Act 1965 for private
unfurnished dwellings (but not while they remain controlled under previous
legislation) which fall within defined limits of rateable value up to 1973
values of £1,500 in London, £750 elsewhere in England and Wales, and £200
(values at 1965, or when first added to the valuation roll) in Scotland. The
Rent Act 1974 extended the system to apply to tenants of furnished accommo¬
dation whose landlords do not live on the same premises. Under the rent
regulation procedure, a ‘fair rent’ may be fixed for the premises by indepen¬
dent rent officers at the request of the landlord, the tenant, or both. Factors
taken into account by rent officers in determining rents include the age,
character and locality of the house and its state of repair. To eliminate any
artificial value derived from scarcity, the assumption is made that for similar
dwellings to let in the area demand does not substantially exceed supply. If
the landlord or tenant objects to the decision of the rent officer, the case is
referred by him to a rent assessment committee. Once determined, the rent
is not normally reviewed for at least three years. Where the new registered
rent is substantially higher than the previous one, phasing provisions have
the effect of applying the increase in equal annual steps over the three-year
period. Since 1965, some 850,000 fair rents have been registered.
Tenants with resident landlords and tenants of a few other types of fur¬
nished accommodation may refer their tenancy agreements to a rent tribunal
for determination of a reasonable rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security
of tenure for up to six months with a possibility of further periods.
Poorer tenants of private accommodation are eligible for assistance with
their rent under a national scheme of rent allowances. Operated by local
authorities, the scheme is financed mainly by government subsidies.
Housing Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of non-
Associations profit-making housing associations and societies, which between them own
and Societies over 250,000 dwellings in Great Britain; some 14,700 were completed or
acquired in 1975.
Voluntary housing associations, set up to provide low-rent accommodation
for people in need, fulfil an increasingly important housing function. There
is a National Federation of Housing Associations, of which 2,150 associations
are members. The associations have in the past borrowed money to finance
house building mainly from local authorities which provide the loan funds
for entire projects. A separate Scottish Federation of Housing Associations
covers housing associations operating in Scotland.
In 1964, a statutory Housing Corporation was set up, with government
funds, to stimulate the formation of co-ownership societies. Its role has been
considerably extended since then. In 1972 H°using Finance Act made
provision for housing associations to borrow from the corporation and in
1974 the Housing Act introduced a scheme under which housing associations
and societies, in order to qualify for government financial assistance, must
register with the corporation. The Act also provides that approved new
projects to provide housing by housing associations registered with the
Housing Corporation (whether funded by the Housing Corporation, by local
authorities or privately) qualify for a housing association grant which reduces
the debt to one which can be serviced from fair rents charged to tenants. A
register was opened in March i975‘ Projects lor riew and improved homes
approved by the Housing Corporation in i975~?6 numbered 36,000.
Early in 1976 the Government announced that it had accepted the
recommendations of a working party that the development of housing co-

operatives (a system which includes a range of types of house ownership,
tenure and management on a co-operative basis) should be encouraged on
local authority estates and within the housing association sector. The Housing
Corporation agreed to set up a specialist unit on housing co-operatives and
an advisory committee has been established by the Secretary of State for the
Environment to provide guidance for the corporation in this new role.
Rented dwellings owned by housing associations come within the fair
rent and rent allowance schemes.
Private owners in Great Britain can obtain grants from local authorities to
improve their houses by providing amenities such as baths, for carrying out
other modernisation works, and for converting large buildings into flats. These
are: ‘improvement grants’ for improvements to a high standard or conversions
into flats, which may be awarded on a maximum eligible expense of up to
£3,2°0 (sometimes £3,700); ‘intermediate grants’ on up to £700 for the
provision of standard amenities, and £800 for associated repairs; ‘special
grants’ (not available in Scotland) depending on the number of standard
amenities to be provided in a house in multiple occupation; and ‘repairs
grants’ on up to £800 expenditure and available only in ‘housing action areas’
and ‘general improvement areas’ (see below). The amount of the award
depends on the location of the dwelling: up to 75 per cent (sometimes 90 per
cent) of the eligible expense in housing action areas; 60 per cent in general
improvement areas; and 50 per cent elsewhere. A government contribution
amounting to 75 per cent (90 per cent in housing action and general improve¬
ment areas) of each grant is paid to the local authority. Aid in the form of
annual subsidy is given by the Government to local authorities and housing
associations, but this can include part of the cost of buying properties for
conversion and improvement as well as that of carrying out works.
Since renovation grants were first introduced in 1949, some 3-2 million
dwellings in England and Wales and (since 1950) some 397,000 in Scotland
have been improved with their aid; in 1975 house renovation grants were
approved for over 159,000 dwellings in Great Britain.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales were given powers under the
Housing Act 1969 to declare ‘general improvement areas’. The aim in these
areas is to encourage householders to improve their dwellings with the aid of
grants, while the local authority uses its comprehensive powers to improve
the environment, A government contribution is available of half the local
authority’s expenditure on environmental improvements on costs of up to
£200 a dwelling. Under the Housing Act 1974 local authorities in England
and Wales are empowered to declare ‘housing action areas’ in places of
housing stress. In such areas authorities have powers in certain circumstances
to compel landlords to improve their houses to a given standard and preferen¬
tial rates of renovation grant are payable. Compulsory powers are also
available to local authorities in general improvement areas. The Housing
(Scotland) Act 1974 makes broadly similar arrangements for Scotland where,
however, the term ‘general improvement area’ is not used and where the
‘housing action area’ powers are available for areas in which at least half the
houses fail to meet prescribed physical standards.
About 3*2 million people have been rehoused in England and Wales since the
mid-1950s as a result of slum clearance programmes and during 1975 some
60,000 houses were demolished or closed in Great Britain as a result of slum
184
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
clearance and other action. Some housing authorities have eliminated all their
slums and others expect to achieve this within a few years, but in certain of
the older industrial towns, clearance will take longer. Local authorities
receive special financial assistance from the Government if they incur a loss
on slum clearance operations.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners of
land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their com¬
pensation up to market value.
Northern Ireland The Northern -Ireland Department of the Environment is responsible for
housing policy in the Province and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
for the provision and management of all public authority housing (some
two-thirds of total output) and for dealing with unfit housing, whether
publicly or privately owned. The Executive is helped and advised by the
Northern Ireland Housing Council representing all district councils. Almost
half the Northern Ireland housing stock has been built since 1945.
In the public sector capital expenditure of the Housing Executive is
financed by loans raised on the open market or borrowed from the National
Loans Fund. New dwellings completed by the Executive qualify for govern¬
ment subsidy at a rate varying according to the number of persons for whom
each dwelling is designed. There is a scheme of grants payable to the Housing
Executive by the Department of the Environment for improvement and
conversion work to its property and for the provision of standard amenities.
(Where houses are basically sound, but have become derelict, vandalised or
abandoned, rehabilitation is 100 per cent grant-aided by the Government. A
major programme to bring such houses back into use has been begun by the
Housing Executive.) The Department of the Environment exercises a
statutory power of approval of rents of all public sector housing. There is a
rent rebate scheme, similar to that in Great Britain, to help poorer tenants.
In the private sector, home ownership is encouraged by subsidies payable
by district councils for houses built for owner occupation or for letting;
while improvement grants are also available. Grants are also payable towards
the cost of new or renovated farm houses and houses for farm workers.
Under a non-statutory scheme grants may be paid for rehabilitation of
private property when it has been the subject of action under the Public
Health Acts. The introduction has been recommended of a rent regulation
system broadly similar to that in Great Britain (see p. 182) for unfurnished
accommodation outside designated redevelopment areas and of rent allow¬
ances for poorer tenants.
A Northern Ireland Committee of the National Federation of Housing
Associations encourages the development of housing associations, particu¬
larly to help the elderly, the handicapped and those living in older houses
which can be improved. It is financed largely by the Department of the
Environment.
10 The Churches
Everyone living in Britain has the right of religious freedom and may mani¬
fest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without interference from
the community or the state. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may
own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and
writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public
office.
In the services administered by the state, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Churches of
England and Scotland provide the principal ministrations and are paid a
salary by the state for this part of their work. Clergy of other denominations
are also appointed. Voluntary schools (see p. 146) provided by churches of any
religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in Britain, since no inquiries are made
about religious beliefs in population censuses1 or other official returns, and
each church adopts its own criteria in counting its members. The membership
figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of
England
Church
Organisation
and Government
The Church of England’s status as the established church of England derives
from a long and stormy relationship between the Church and the state culmi¬
nating in the Reformation in the sixteenth century. The Church’s relationship
with the state is one of mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church
balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always
be a member of the Church, and promises on his or her accession to uphold it;
Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an oath of
allegiance to the Crown. The Church had to have Parliament’s consent to
change its form of worship until 1975, when the Worship and Doctrine
Measure became law. This gave the Church freedom to regulate its own
worship. The two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their
seniority as diocesan bishops) have permanent seats in the House of Lords
(see p. 29). Clergy of the Church of England (together with those of the Church
of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are
legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons (see p. 31).
The Church is organised into 43 dioceses, grouped into two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there are some 14,260. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is styled ‘Primate of All England’, and the Arch¬
bishop of York is ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and resident in
the two provinces (roughly 47 million in 1973), about 60 per cent are baptised
into the Church and some 20 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body of the Church, the General Synod, is invested
with both spiritual authority and legislative and administrative powers; and
1 In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people’s religious professions.

Communion
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
bishops, clergy and lay members are involved in decisions affecting the whole
range of the Church’s concern. In the dioceses, diocesan and deanery synods
are linked both with the General Synod and parish organisations. Certain
important issues must be referred for the approval of the dioceses before they
are finally decided by the General Synod. Lay members of the Church are
associated with church government in the parishes through the ancient office
of churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils on which are
members appointed by baptised members of the Church over the age of 17
who are on the church electoral roll of their local parish.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
various aspects of the Church’s work—such as education, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and church work at home and overseas. It is
concerned with the Church of England schools and some independent
schools (see p. 149); church colleges of education in England and Wales;
theological colleges; and establishments for the training of women in pastoral
work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central General Synod Fund which the Central Board of
Finance administers for the maintenance of central services, including capital
expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for training can¬
didates for ordination. (Although the state pays for or contributes towards
some services provided by the Church—see p. 185—it makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses.1) The Church’s endowment income (from
assets amounting to £505 million in 1975 in land and investments) is
mainly administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely respon¬
sible for the payment of clergy stipends and the provision of finance for
pensions. Increase in the total net income (^34-i million in 1974-75) has
meant a rise in the stipends of the poorer clergy and the introduction of
schemes for better parsonages, for church buildings in new areas of popula¬
tion, and for better pensions for clergymen and their widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 22 autonomous Provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four Provinces: the established
Church of England and the unestablished Church in Wales, Episcopal Church
in Scotland, and Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (the next meeting will be in 1978) the Lambeth Conference
meets for unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops: presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys
great prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two years—is designed to provide consultations
within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of common
action. The council met in Trinidad in 1976.
1 In 1975 the Government agreed in principle to provide a measure of state aid for
historic churches and other ecclesiastical buildings still in use. This aid is also available
for other denominations.
THE CHURCHES
The Church of
Scotland
The Free
Churches
187
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government. It has been
described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is established and yet
is free’. Its status as the national church derives from the Treaty of Union
1707 and the Church of Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church appoints its own officers and its
decisions on questions of doctrine and discipline are not subject to parliamen¬
tary discussion or modification.
All ministers of the Church of Scotland are of equal status, each of some
2,000 churches being governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and the elected elders of the church; above the Kirk Session is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually
under the presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The
Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Com¬
missioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is estimated at over one million.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England (which dissent from certain practices of the established
church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regarding organi¬
sation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain (apart
from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and religious
associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 558,000.
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is nowadays based on a 1932 union of most
of the separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (5,400 members) and the
Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,500 members).
The United Reformed Church, with some 187,000 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), with a total membership of about 187,000; in addition there are separate
Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist churches.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with some 123,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers nearly
97,000; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the
United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations in Britain include: the Unitarian and Free
Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States
of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the

Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational
Federation, formed from Congregational churches which did not enter the
United Reformed Church. The Society of Friends (Quakers)—with over
20,000 members in Britain—came into being in the middle of the seventeenth
century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace and the relief
of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 82
other countries. Within Britain it has some 100,000 active members operating
from more than 1,000 centres of worship and there is a worldwide community
strength of about 2 million. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian
concern, the Salvation Army in Britain also has 209 centres providing help for
people in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 300
branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 6 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 4-2 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in Britain are
staffed by members of the religious orders for men and women, who also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct of
homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
Anglo-Jewish community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some
410,000 people, including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal)
and Ashkenazi (from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the
largest groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group
(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Jewish congregations in Britain number about 45°- There has been an
increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in five Jewish children. The first woman to become a
rabbi in Britain was ordained in 1975.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.

The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. It is estimated that there are
nearly 1 million Muslims in Britain; there are mosques or Islamic centres
in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and in many
other large cities. The community’s headquarters are at the London
Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre. The Buddhist Society has its
headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room and a Buddhist library claimed
to be one of the finest in Europe; there are also Shrine Rooms in the two
Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai monks and supported by the
Thai Government. In Scotland there is a Shrine Room at the Tibetan Centre.
Hindu and Sikh temples have been established in many areas where Asian
immigrants have settled.
The British Council of Churches, composed of representatives or consultant
observers from all the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates
common action among the churches and seeks to further Christian unity. It
works with the Conference of Missionary Societies of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales and aims to promote unity and joint action among the Free Churches
and to provide a channel for communication with central and local govern¬
ment authorities.
The Permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches
is an associated national council) which links together some 250 churches in
over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common problems. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding among members
of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.
The New English Bible, a translation into modern English completed in
1970, is the result of co-operation among many of the Christian churches in
Britain.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
11 The National
Economy
Britain’s economy is characterised by the contribution of manufacturing
industry and services^ to national output—accounting, respectively, for about
30 and 45 per cent of total domestic income—and the importance of interna¬
tional trade (exports of goods and services equal about 30 per cent of gross
domestic product). Britain ranks fifth in world trade (after the United States,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and France) and accounts for 6 per
cent of total trade between the market economies. It takes over 9 per cent of the
world’s exports of primary products, and contributes about 9 per cent to the
main manufacturing countries’ exports of manufactured goods.
The discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil and gas resources is having a
fundamental effect on the economy.
As a result of a high level of agricultural productivity, Britain provides just
over half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 2-7 per cent of the
working population are engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than in
any other major industrial country. The remaining agricultural supplies are
imported, Britain being among the world’s largest importers of such products
as wheat, meat, butter, fodder grains, fruit, tea, tobacco and wool. Other
imports include raw materials (such as metallic ores, crude oil and timber) and
semi-manufactures (for example, chemicals and textile yarns), as well as manu¬
factured products.
Britain earns overseas currency by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods
and by invisible transactions—earnings on overseas investment, travel, civil
aviation, British-owned shipping, and financial, banking, insurance and other
services. Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor
vehicles, electrical equipment, finished textiles and most types of machinery.
The gross domestic product per head of population rose in real terms by about
19 per cent between 1965 and 1975.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
Earlier Develop¬
ment of the
Economy
As a result of the ‘Industrial Revolution’ during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character
of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It
occupied a leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker
and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increasing
population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear lead

banking, finance and business services, public health and education, and other services
excluding public administration, defence and ownership of dwellings.
The Second World
War and After
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 191
over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914, industrial competition
from Europe and North America grew, but its effects on Britain’s export
industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by a number of
factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on Britain’s large over¬
seas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
difficulties were increased by the world economic depression which began in
1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce imports. The
result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The decade saw a
strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (1939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained,
in a modified form, a permanent feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war ran
down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping
losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements.
Some ^1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in
North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated,
while exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. Quantitative restrictions on most
imports were gradually removed, exchange controls on transactions between
the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part lifted, and
convertibility of sterling on current account was introduced for non-residents.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of the Government in managing the economy are to achieve a
steady and sustainable rate of growth, rising exports and investment, a sound
balance of payments, a high level of employment and a more equitable dis¬
tribution of income. Its policies are carried out by the main government
departments with economic responsibilities on a national scale: the Treasury,
the Departments of Trade, Industry, Employment, Energy, Prices and Con¬
sumer Protection, the Environment, and Transport, and the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. Other bodies
responsible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see
p. 207) and the Office of Manpower Economics (which provides the secretariat
for the three pay review bodies, see p. 338).

Guidance of the
Economy
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
problems such as inflation, the Government makes known its purposes, and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy, by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy
rests with the Cabinet (see p. 41).
The Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibilities for regional
planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional Eco¬
nomic Planning Councils and Economic Planning Boards. There is a council
and a board in each of the eight economic planning regions: Northern, York¬
shire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South East, South West,
West Midlands and North West. The councils, which are advisory bodies,
comprise part-time members with wide experience of their regions. They help
in the preparation ofbroad economic and land-use strategies which provide a
regional framework for national and local planning and investment decisions.
The boards consist of senior officials in the regions of the government depart¬
ments concerned with aspects of regional planning. They co-ordinate the
regional work of departments and provide the councils with information and
advice.
Scotland also has an Economic Council and an Economic Planning Board;
there is a Welsh Council and a Welsh Planning Board; and Northern Ireland
has an Economic Council.
The period after 1945 was one of rising production and, until 1970, a low level
of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower); but economic growth,
which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to 1971 > was rather slower than in most other
western European countries. There were also certain persistent economic
problems, such as periodic difficulties with the balance of payments especially
during periods of relatively high pressure of demand. In spite of the contribu¬
tion from invisibles, there were substantial deficits on current account in a
number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems
in a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices. Fol¬
lowing the devaluation of sterling in 1967) from $2’8o to $2'40=^i, exports
recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record current
account surplus by 1971.
In 1973, the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about 5 per cent in
response to government policies introduced from 1971 onwards, designed to
raise the growth rate and so reduce unemployment. However, with the onset
of the world energy crisis towards the end of 1973, the growth rate began to
slow down. During 1974 the world economy entered a phase of recession,
caused mainly by accelerating inflation and the large increase in the cost of oil
(see p. 370). The main impact on the British economy came early in 1975,
rather later than in many other countries. By the third quarter of 1975 the gross
domestic product (GDP) had fallen by about 4-5 per cent in volume terms from
the level in the third quarter of I974> with a greater fall in manufacturing
output, and unemployment was rising.
In the April 1975 Budget, the Government took measures designed to
release resources for exports, strengthen Britain’s industrial base and reduce
the public sector borrowing requirement as a percentage of gross national pro¬
duct. More generally, the measures reflected the need to ensure greater
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

security of employment in the medium term and a balanced economic recovery
as the expected revival of world trade occurred. Towards the end of 1975, the
first signs of improvement were apparent. The rate of increase of retail prices
showed a sharp deceleration while the current deficit on the balance of pay¬
ments for 1975 was less than half that for 1974 (though with falls in both export
and import volumes). By the beginning of 1976, there were signs of rapid
growth in export volume in part at least reflecting the improvement of world
trading conditions. Unemployment continued to rise, however, and selective
measures designed to slow down the rate of increase were introduced in late
1975 and early 1976.
Measures were introduced in the April 1976 Budget designed to reduce
inflation further so as to enable the fastest possible achievement of full employ¬
ment, external balance and the regeneration of British industry. As part of the
strategy to reduce inflation, certain proposed changes in income tax were made
conditional on the acceptance by the Trades Union Congress of a new pay
limit (see p. 194).
The Government’s general aims for public expenditure and for growth
were reaffirmed in Public Expenditure to igyg-80, published in February 1976.
Further measures to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement
were announced in July 1976 including cuts in public expenditure plans
for 1977-78 which would give a total saving of over £1,000 million and an
increase in the employers’ national insurance contributions which would
yield over £900 million. The measures would reduce the borrowing require¬
ment from an estimated 9 per cent of GDP in 1976-77 to 6 per cent in 1977-78.
Control of Inflation Inflation, which began to gather momentum in the 1950s and 1960s, has con¬
tinued to rise in Britain, as in most other developed industrial countries, in the
first half of the 1970s. The relatively rapid acceleration in Britain from 1970
until mid-1975 was due first to sharp increases in world prices of food and raw
materials (especially oil) which Britain must import in large quantities, and
secondly to very high rates of pay settlements from mid-1974, which led to
substantial increases in industrial costs. From 1975, however, there has been a
decline. In the last 30 years successive governments have adopted policies
(including statutory controls of prices or wages or of both) to slow down the
rate of inflation. Since the Government took office in early 1974, counter infla¬
tion policy has had three phases, each related to the ‘social contract’ between
the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (see p. 341) under which the
Labour Party originally undertook to maintain free collective wage bargaining
without statutory control, to control prices, to help the lower-paid and pen¬
sioners and to aim at full employment; while the TUC acknowledged that, in
the absence of a statutory incomes policy, trade unions have loyalties not only
to their own members but to other members of the community, and should
therefore aim to keep pay increases in step with the cost of living.
In June 1974 the TUC issued a policy statement, Collective Bargaining and
the Social Contract, reviewing the situation and containing recommendations
(or ‘guidelines’) to unions and negotiators about the conduct of collective bar¬
gaining in the period ahead. The statement was a response to the Government’s
commitment to a wide range of economic and social policies (including the
payment of subsidies on certain basic foodstuffs, control of housing rents,
higher pensions and other social benefits).
While the majority of wage negotiations during the 1974-75 PaY round took
account of the guidelines, the social contract did not prove altogether effective
in restraining pay increases and in the first half of 1975, wage rates were running
I94
Price Control

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
at about 33 per cent more than in the preceding year and retail prices at about
25 per cent more. After urgent consultations between the Government, the
TUC and the CBI in mid-1975, the TUC issued a new statement, The Develop¬
ment of the Social Contract, which proposed a new voluntary limit on pay
increases of £6 a week, with no increases at all for those earning annual salaries
above a certain cut-off point. The limit was to apply for 12 months from 1st
August 1975. In The Attack on Inflation, published on nth July i975> the
Government endorsed the £6 limit and set the cut-off point at £8,500 a year.
It undertook for its part to continue its action on prices (including maintaining
the existing system of price control and spending more than previously en¬
visaged on food and housing subsidies) and to limit dividend increases to
10 per cent. The Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975 was introduced
in order to relieve employers of any contractual obligation to make pay in¬
creases in excess of the £6 limit. As a further measure to combat inflation, the
Government announced that it would be reinforcing control of public expendi¬
ture in 1976-77 by making extensive use of cash limits, to be applied to 75 per
cent of central Government voted expenditure (see p. 351) other than social
security benefits.
The £6 pay limit was universally observed and proved very successful. In
the year to July 1976, average earnings had increased by little more than half
the rate of increase over the year to July 1975. Largely as a result, the rate of
retail price inflation had also been dramatically reduced, again to about half
the level of the preceding year.
Nevertheless, Britain’s inflation rate continued to be appreciably higher than
that of its major overseas competitors. In the spring and early summer of 1976
there were, therefore, further discussions between the Government and both
sides of industry on a second round of voluntary wage restraint, to run
for another year from 1st August 197b and designed to bring Britain s inflation
down to the level of its competitors by the end of 1977. Again details of the new
pay limit were set out by the TUC in a report, The Social Contract 1976—77,
published at the end of May 1976. The new limit, to run for 12 months from
1 st August 1976, provides for a 5 per cent increase, subject to a minimum of
£2-50 and a maximum of £4 a week, and is expected to represent an average
increase of about 4-5 per cent. Following the TUC’s acceptance of the pay
limit, Parliament implemented a number of tax reliefs which had first been
proposed conditionally in the April Budget. In June 197b the Government
published The Attack on Inflation, The Second Year, endorsing the proposed
pay limit (see Bibliography, p. 4b3). A reaffirmation of continuing co-operation
on economic policy and a statement of priorities for the next three years was
endorsed by the TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee (see p. 342), in July
197b.
Since 1973 a strict system of price control has been operated by the Price
Commission, an independent statutory agency set up under the Counter-
Inflation Act 1973. The controls are set out in the Price Code, drawn up by the
Government and amended from time to time as appropriate. Generally speak¬
ing the Price Code is designed to ensure that any price increases are fully
justified on grounds of unavoidable rises in costs.
In controlling the money supply the Government is concerned to ensure that
industry’s financial requirements are safeguarded against other demands,
notably those of the public sector, and that monetary growth is prevented from
adding to inflationary pressures.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
195
Role of Public
Enterprise
Despite an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement, the pace of
monetary expansion experienced in 1972 and 1973 slackened substantially in
1974 and 1975 and the rate of growth remained modest to mid-1976. After
declining in early 1975, interest rates rose sharply in the summer but fell again
in late 1975 and early 1976, following United States rates. Rates became more
stable after the rise in minimum lending rate in May 1976 but minimum
lending rate was raised again in September 1976 to correct a tendency towards
increased monetary growth.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct state intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) is often effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. The most important are those which
in the public interest operate major nationalised industries—including coal,
electricity, gas, steel, railways, airports and air transport, commercial road
transport and postal services. These industries and services are described in
their relevant sections. Altogether about 8 per cent of all employees work for
these bodies. (The public sector employs about a quarter of the working popu¬
lation.)
Recent developments have included the establishment of the British National
Oil Corporation through which the Government exercises its participation
rights in the exploitation of Britain’s offshore oil resources and proposals for
the nationalisation of the shipbuilding and aircraft industries and the bringing of
privately owned commercial ports and cargo handling activities under public
ownership and control.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not gener¬
ally civil servants and although accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring depart¬
ments who are responsible for management. Certain of the nationalised indus¬
tries are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help them to carry
out duties with which they have been charged.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of
the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any informa¬
tion, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice, as the
responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are
reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to issue
a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual statu¬
tory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that
receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial targets
have been agreed by the Government with the different industries (or are under
discussion) ranging from 15-5 per cent gross return on capital employed to
‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have been allowed for. In addi¬
tion the industries are expected to apply a test discount rate of 10 per cent for
new investment. The responsible minister is usually empowered, subject to
Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which
may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the present system is
196
European
Community
Membership
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is provided mainly by
interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and in certain cases by borrowing
from abroad.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of repre¬
sentative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions made to
them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes they think
desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A House of
Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries examines their
reports and accounts. (Its powers of investigation also include several other
public corporations such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority, Cable
and Wireless Limited and certain activities of the Bank of England.)
State participation and intervention in industry takes several other forms
such as the majority share holdings in certain companies held by the National
Enterprise Board (see p. 206) and these are described on pp. 206-12.
The main economic adjustments consequent upon Britain’s membership of
the European Community are set out in Chapter 3 and in other relevant
chapters.
Overseas
Trade and
Payments
THE EXTERNAL POSITION
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services
increased rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current trans¬
actions of over j£i,ooo million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the
reserves stood at the high level of just over £2,740 million by the end of May
1972, after the repayment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate; imports were swollen by the
rapid growth of domestic demand, and exports were affected by various factors
including the slower growth of world trade. This deterioration, together with
growing fears about inflation, led to a large outflow of short-term speculative
capital in June 1972, and the Government decided to allow the pound to float
and applied exchange control to transactions with the overseas sterling area
countries (see p. 198). The lower sterling exchange rate made Britain highly
competitive, and the volume of exports, which had not changed from 1971 to
1972, increased by 14 per cent in 1973 and by 7 per cent in 1974. Nevertheless,
mainly as a result of rising prices of imports, including oil, and despite the
positive invisible balance, there was a large deficit on the current account in
both 1973 and 1974. There was a considerable improvement in 1975. largely
because of lower import volumes and more favourable terms of trade (see
p. 369). In future years increasing supplies of oil from the North Sea (see
p. 259) can be expected to bring considerable advantage to the balance of pay¬
ments. (For details of overseas trade and payments see Chapter 18.)
Exchange Rates In December 1971, following a period of uncertainty in international exchange
markets, particularly affecting the United States dollar, a general international
realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a meeting held in the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington, in which all the main currencies were in effect revalued

Agreements
against the dollar. (The rates of exchange fixed in that agreement are called
Smithsonian parities.) As part of this realignment, the sterling rate for the
dollar moved up by just over 8| per cent, the new middle rate being $2'6o57i
compared with the old par value of $2'40. At the end of August 1976 the effec¬
tive depreciation of sterling (since the float in 1972) in relation to the Smith¬
sonian parities structure was about ^9 per cent, and the market rate was
£1 =.$17764.
Five member countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands), as
well as Sweden and Norway, maintain a scheme, usually called the ‘snake’,
under which rates between any two of their currencies cannot diverge from
their cross parities by more than 2j per cent. Britain, France and Italy were
formerly members of the scheme.
The Committee of Twenty (representative of the major industrial and the
developing countries), which had been set up within the International Mone¬
tary Fund (IMF) framework, concluded its work on the reform of the inter¬
national monetary system in June 1974. The committee agreed on a method of
valuation of the special drawing right (SDR—an international reserve asset)
for an interim period, recommended guidelines for the management of floating
exchange rates, and agreed on some principles of corrective action for countries
with balance of payments disequilibria.
In January 1976, at a meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, agreement was reached
by the IMF’s Interim Committee, subject to ratification, on revised IMF
Articles of Agreement, which incorporate many of the recommendations of
the Committee of Twenty. Provision has been made for an eventual return to a
par value system but meanwhile members may operate individual exchange
arrangements, subject to firm surveillance by the IMF. The articles, as revised,
facilitate the use of special drawing rights and substantially reduce the status
of gold by providing for the abolition of the official gold price and of gold
transactions between member countries and the IMF. The IMF’s gold hold¬
ings are, moreover, being gradually reduced; one-sixth is to be returned to
members, and a further sixth is being auctioned, the major proportion of the
proceeds from the auctions being used to finance a trust fund which has been
set up to provide medium-term balance of payments support to the poorest
developing countries.
Discussions on reform have been accompanied by measures designed to help
recycle oil funds and to assist the developing countries with the problems
caused for them by the increases in oil prices and the depression of world
trade. After the oil price increases, the IMF set up a borrowing agreement for
1974 (which was continued in 1975), known as the oil facility through which
countries could draw on funds lent mainly by the oil-producers. Although the
facility has not been continued in 1976, the ordinary credit tranches of the IMF
have been temporarily widened by 45 per cent (permanent increases in quotas
have been agreed upon but not yet ratified). Other measures include a liberali¬
sation of the Compensatory Financing Facility to provide support for primary
producing countries and a Financial Support Fund which has been set up
within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (a
group of 24 developed countries) as a safety net for its members.
Sterling
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, sterling, in
addition to being Britain’s domestic currency, came to serve as a major inter¬
national currency, particularly for the countries constituting the Sterling

Area, who chose to tie their currencies to sterling and to keep most of their
exchange reserves in the form of balances with the Bank of England. The
Sterling Area came to include all the Commonwealth countries and their
dependencies, except Canada and Rhodesia, together with Bahrain, Iceland,
the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South
Africa, Namibia (South West Africa), the United Arab Emirates and the
People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen.
As trade and payments arrangements have become more diversified in
recent years, however, the international use of sterling has declined relatively,
with only a few countries retaining the special links with sterling that charac¬
terised membership of the Sterling Area, although many, even outside the
former Sterling Area, continue to hold sizeable portions of their reserves in
sterling.
NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
In 1975 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to £94,095 million. After allowing for price
changes, the increase over the to years since 1965 was nearly 22.5 per cent.
About a third of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry and
this proportion has remained more or less constant for a number of years. The
expanding industry groups in recent years (in relation to the economy as a
whole) have been most of the services, particularly insurance, banking and
finance, public administration and health and educational services. Agri¬
culture, forestry and fishing have accounted for a small and slowly declining
share, and mining for a small and more rapidly declining share. The relative
contribution of the distributive trades has also declined. Table 8 summarises
the contribution of each industry group.
Table 9 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services in 1965,
1970 and 1975 at 1970 market prices, divided between personal consumption,
public expenditure on goods and services, investment and exports.
The main trends since 1965 are a fall in the proportion of total available out¬
put devoted to personal consumption and a significant rise in the proportion
devoted to exports.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from over £30,000 million in 1965 to £95,700 million in 1975. Consumer ex¬
penditure amounted to 66 per cent of total pre-tax income in 1975 compared
with 76 per cent in 1965. The difference is accounted for by a higher incidence
of direct taxation and national insurance contributions and increased personal
savings.
Income from employment in 1975 totalled £68,200 million and accounted for
about 71 per cent of total personal income (a slightly higher percentage than in
1965). The three other main sources of personal income were self-employment
(9 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (9 per cent), and grants
from public authorities (11 per cent).
The combined effect of taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind
is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by

Note; Figures are preliminary estimates (rounded to nearest £10 million) and exclude items under £125 million
1972-73. The second report, on income from companies, shows that rather
more than one-third of dividends go indirectly to about 11 million members
of occupational pension schemes, 2-25 million taxpayers receiving occupational
pensions and 14 million taxpayers who save through life assurance; these
groups include many people of moderate means.
A rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in Britain
as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern. The pro¬
portions of expenditure devoted to food, tobacco and clothing have been falling
while the proportions spent on housing, alcoholic drink, and the running costs
of motor vehicles have risen. These and other changes are shown in Table 10.
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 29 per cent at 1970 market prices over the period
1965 to 1975 when it amounted to about 24.6 per cent of the gross domestic pro¬
duct (at current prices). The main cause of this increase was the continuing
growth of the social services, especially education. Defence has recent y
accounted for a declining share of public expenditure on goods and services—
22 per cent in 1975 compared with 34 per cent in 1965 and a peak of 48 per cent
in 1953-

In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp. 122 and 180). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 55 per cent of their current expenditure.

Gross domestic fixed capital formation represents about 22 per cent of the
gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value of fixed assets in Britain,
valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to have increased by 47 per
cent between 1965 and 1975 when their current replacement value, net of
depreciation, was some ^322,100 million, of which about two-thirds was
accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and machinery, and vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1975 (£9,967
million compared with £9>453 miHion in 197° at constant prices) private
sector investment accounted for 12-2 per cent of the gross domestic product at
factor cost (12-3 per cent in 1970) and the public sector for 8-9 per cent (9-5 per
cent). The approximate shares of industry groups in total fixed investment in
1975 were (1970 figures in brackets): manufacturing, 17 per cent (23 per cent),
gas, electricity and water, 6 per cent (8 per cent), transport and communica¬
tions, 12 per cent (13 per cent), distributive trades, 5 per cent (5 per cent),
dwellings, 18 per cent (17 per cent), social and other public services, 14 per cent
(15 per cent), and other industries, 24 per cent (16 per cent). There is a marked
cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry; it was
at a low point in 1967 and 1972, rose in 1973 and 1974, but fell again in 1975.
Among the trends over recent years have been increases in investment in
agriculture, mining (other than coal mining), North Sea oil equipment, ship¬
ping and retail distribution.

There was a marked improvement in the financial position of the company
sector in 1975, following the substantial deficit in 1974, largely as the result of a
rundown in stocks. The public sector’s financial deficit increased substantially
in 1975 to some £8,280 million, 56 per cent higher than in 1974; but more than
half of the public sector borrowing requirement in 1975 was covered by sales
of debt to the non-bank public. ^The personal sector’s surplus continued to rise
in 1975, mainly reflecting a continuing high personal savings ratio. A large part
of personal savings took the form of building society deposits. The surplus of
the overseas sector (which reflects the deficit on the current account of the
balance of payments) was substantially smaller than in 1974.
12 Industry
Statistics
Structure
Production industries (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and
gas, electricity and water) and distributive trades together account for more
than half of Britain’s gross domestic product, manufacturing for some 287 per
cent and distributive trades 9-8 per cent. About 51 per cent of Britain’s em¬
ployed labour force is engaged in these sectors, while over 80 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports consists of manufactured or semi-manufactured pro¬
ducts. The following sections discuss general industrial topics—such as invest¬
ment, productivity, location and the Government’s relations with industry—
together with manufacturing industry, construction and distributive and
service trades. For the energy industries (coal, gas, petroleum, electricity, non¬
fuel minerals and water supply) see Chapter 13 and for the agriculture,
fisheries and forestry industries see Chapter 14.
The main source of statistical information on industrial topics is the Business
Monitor series produced by the Business Statistics Office of the Department of
Industry (see p. 49), and compiled from returns made by firms in industry.
Monthly and quarterly Production Series Monitors cover some 150 manufactur¬
ing industries and their products, with information on output and overseas trade
concerning some 4,000 commodities. Annual Census of Production Reports give
total industrial figures for production, capital expenditure, stocks, wages,
salaries and employment. The Overseas Trade Statistics of the United Kingdom
contain detailed information on overseas trade, the December issue carrying
cumulative totals for the whole calendar year. The five-yearly Census of
Distribution is published in special reports; and short-term statistics on service
and distributive trades appear in a separate series of Business Monitor. The
weekly publication Trade and Industry includes regular statistics and com¬
mentary on industrial output, investment, retail sales and overseas trade, and
employment statistics are published in the monthly Department of Employment
Gazette. Many of the figures are brought together in summary form in the
Monthly Digest of Statistics and the Annual Abstract of Statistics. The inter¬
dependency between industries is shown in the input-output tables published
annually as Business Monitor PA 1004.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
such large-scale organisations as the General Electric Company (202,000
employees) and Imperial Chemical Industries (201,000), and the public
corporations such as the National Coal Board with about 321,000 employees, to
the many thousands of small firms. Most manufacturing is in the hands of
private enterprise. Under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill of
I975> ^ proposed to take into public ownership a large part of the aircraft and
shipbuilding industries. The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975
provides for greater public control of offshore oil and gas resources (see p. 261).
Most iron and steel production is already in public ownership. Other state-
204
Small Firms
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
controlled products include a small range of chemicals from the plants of the
British Steel Corporation; locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops
of British Railways; military equipment and supplies made in establishments
of the defence services; and fissile materials and radioactive isotopes, made by
two statutory companies. In addition, among other shareholdings, the Govern¬
ment has major holdings in British Petroleum Ltd. and through the National
Enterprise Board set up by the Industry Act 1975 (see P* 2°^) British
Leyland Ltd. and Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Census of Production igyi. This shows that some
68 per cent (60,900) of the 89,700 or so establishments which submitted returns
had fewer than 25 employees each and accounted for 7 per cent of total employ¬
ment; 26,000 establishments had between 25 and 500 employees and accounted
for some 38 per cent of the total labour force; 2,100 establishments, each with
between 500 and 1,500 employees, were responsible for 22 per cent of employ¬
ment, while one-third was in the hands of the 708 groups each with over 1,500
employees. A high proportion of the biggest establishments were in the heavy
industries. An enterprise, as defined in the 1971 census, normally consists of
either a single firtn or a parent company together with its subsidiaries. Over
35 per cent of all employment in British manufacturing industries in 197^ "^s
accounted for by) the largest 100 private enterprises. A further indication of
company size is the value of capital employed (net assets). For two companies,
British Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading, the figure exceeds £3,000
million; about 60 companies registered in Britain have over £200 million net
assets. Of the top 20 industrial groups in Europe in terms of annual sales, five
are British.
The trend/towards mergers and regrouping has gathered momentum as
competitioj/in the economy has intensified and, in many branches of industry,
profitable operation has become dependent on concentration and economies of
scale. The peak in terms of value of assets acquired was reached in 1972,
since when the trend has been considerably less marked. Larger units of control
have been established in almost all the leading industries and in some a small
number of big companies and their subsidiaries are responsible for a great
proportion of total production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal
smelting, motor vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics,
machine tools, brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine
publishing. Shares in these companies are, however, usually distributed among
many holders or are held by insurance companies or pension funds representing
a broad cross-section of the community, and it is rare for a few holders to have a
controlling interest. For example, more than 40 of the largest public companies
each have more than 100,000 shareholders.
Within the general arrangements for promoting industrial expansion and
modernisation, smaller firms, which account for about one-fifth of manu¬
facturing output and about one-third of employment, have recently received
more government attention. In the Department of Industry there is a minister
with special responsibility for the small firms sector and a separate division
responsible for the development, inter-departmental co-ordination and im¬
plementation of policy towards small firms and for the administration of the
official services provided for them. The most important of these is the network
of ten small firms information centres in Great Britain, which work in co¬
operation with Chambers of Commerce, trade associations and other orgamsa-

tions and are provided with a comprehensive data bank in order to guide small
firms towards appropriate sources of information and assistance.
In Northern Ireland, the Local Enterprise Development Unit, established
by the Government in 1971, exists to help with the creation of small industries,
usually employing fewer than 50 people initially. Financial assistance and
marketing advice are among the many services offered. By mid-1976 the Local
Enterprise Development Unit had promoted nearly 6,000 new jobs in Northern
Ireland.
Voluntary associations are formed by private enterprises for a number of
different purposes, including the provision of common services, the exchange
of information and representation of their members’ point of view; the regula¬
tion of trading practices; and negotiation with trade unions on wages and
conditions of work. These associations cover, with varying completeness, most
of British industry. Trade associations, concerned mainly with representation
to the Government, the provision of common services and the regulation of
trading practices, are normally composed of firms manufacturing a particular
product or group of products. Employers’ organisations which deal with
employment matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of
operation or manufacturing process. In an industrial sector concerned wholly
with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all the
required functions.
There are some 150 national employers’ associations concerned with negotia¬
tion of wages and conditions of work (see p. 340). The number of manufacturers’
associations concerned with providing common services is not known precisely
but is thought to total some 1,200 varying greatly in importance, structure and
activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government as a channel for
consultation between government departments and representatives of private
employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory and consultative
body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining their collective
views and representing them nationally to the Government and the public and
also internationally, for example in the Council of European Industrial
Federations. CBI representatives sit on the National Economic Development
Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and Safety Com¬
mission and other official advisory committees and voluntary bodies concerned
with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 10,000 companies and about 200
employers’ organisations and trade and commercial associations. Nationalised
industries have joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisa¬
tion in Britain and is widely represented abroad. In matters of common concern
the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers of commerce. These are open to all
kinds of producers and traders and exist to promote the interests of local,
regional and national industry and commerce. Most chambers provide export
facilities, including the sponsorship of outward trade missions and visits. The
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the co¬
ordinating body to which 87 local chambers are affiliated, together with 16
British Chambers of Commerce operating in Europe and elsewhere. These
chambers have a membership of about 50,000 firms. In Scotland there is an
additional central organisation, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, and in
Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
to which local chambers are affiliated.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government is giving priority to industrial development, in order to
reverse the relative decline in this sector that has been continuous for many
years. In view of the central importance to the economy of manufacturing
industry, government policy is concerned with improving its structure and
performance, while at the same time developing effective solutions to such
major problems as regional imbalance and unemployment. The industrial
strategy, launched at the National Economic Development Council in 1975,
involves a programme of tripartite studies involving representatives of Govern¬
ment, management and trade unions of key sectors of manufacturing industry.
These studies are aimed at recommending action to improve the prospects of
the chosen industries and developing medium-term strategies for them. The
Government influences industrial activity in a number of ways—through fiscal
and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure, by incentives for
industrial investment and by the provision of services, information and advice.
Legislative arrangements control aspects of employment, monopolies, mergers
and restrictive trade practices and new industrial and office building and
changes in land use.
One of the main measures by which the Government is implementing its
industrial policy is the Industry Act 1975* The Act established a statutory
body, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), as a new source of public invest¬
ment capital, with an initial borrowing limit of £700 million, which may be in¬
creased by order to £1,000 million. Its purposes are the development of or
assistance to the national economy, the promotion of industrial efficiency and
international competitiveness and the provision, maintenance and safeguarding
of employment in Britain. Among other things the NEB provides finance for
industrial investment and restructuring and assistance to companies in short¬
term difficulties. It has a holding company role for shareholdings previously
held by the Government, together with its own investments. The NEB is
expected to exercise a commercial judgement and to look for an adequate
return on its investments. In Scotland and Wales, broadly similar functions
are executed regionally by the Scottish and W elsh Development Agencies
in relation to companies which are predominantly Scottish or W elsh. In
Northern Ireland these functions are being carried out by the Northern Ireland
Development Agency. Another provision of the Industry Act 1975 rdcitfis to a
system of voluntary planning agreements between the Government and some
leading firms.
The Department of Industry is responsible for industrial policy as a whole on
both a national and regional level; 1975 marked the devolution of certain
responsibilities towards industry in Scotland and Wales to the Scottish and
Welsh Offices respectively. In Northern Ireland the Department of Commerce
deals with industry and industrial development. Related responsibilities (for
example, those of the Department of Employment for manpower affairs) are
discussed in the appropriate chapters.
There is close association between industry and the Government through
such channels as the National Economic Development Council, the main
forum for consultation between the Government, management and the trade
unions, and the Economic Development Committees (EDCs) which cover
particular industrial sectors.
The EDCs bring together leading representatives of government, manage¬
ment and unions to study, and make recommendations on, the efficiency and
prospects of individual industries.

207
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices and of powers to regulate
any structural changes or uncompetitive practices which operate against the
public interest. The relevant statute is the Fair Trading Act 1973 which con¬
tains all current legislation on monopolies and mergers; it also sets out recent
changes and additions to the restrictive practices legislation. The Director
General of Fair Trading has certain statutory responsibilities in respect of
monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices, in addition to his work on
consumer protection.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition in trade between member countries. The
Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of Rome,
apply to industrial and commercial practices likely to affect trade and prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the Community. Agreements which fall
within the rules must be notified to the European Commission; the Commission
has limited powers to exempt agreements which, though restrictive of com¬
petition between member countries, benefit the Community in defined ways.
Monopoly situations can be referred—by the Secretary of State for Prices and
Consumer Protection or by the Director General of Fair Trading—for investi¬
gation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The market share by
reference to which monopoly is defined is one-quarter; local monopolies and
monopolies in public sector industries can also be referred to the commission.
If the commission finds that monopoly conditions operate against the public
interest (for example, the commission must take into account the need to
maintain and promote the balanced distribution of industry and employment in
Britain) the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection has powers
to make orders and otherwise to remedy or prevent the harm which the com¬
mission considers may result. These powers are, however, not available to imple¬
ment reports by the commission on general references or references of restrictive
labour practices. The Director General of Fair Trading also has the duty, when
requested by ministers, of negotiating undertakings with the firms concerned
following a commission report, of advising on the use of the order-making
power and of supervising the observance of undertakings or orders.
A merger may be referred to the commission by the Secretary of State for
Prices and Consumer Protection if it results in, or intensifies, a monopoly
situation, or if the value of gross assets taken over exceeds £5 million. There are
special provisions relating to newspaper and certain other mergers. The Director
General of Fair Trading has the same task of advising on the action to be taken
following a commission report on a merger reference that he has in relation to
monopoly reports.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1956 and 1968, as amended by the Fair
Trading Act 1973, require the entry in a public register of the particulars of a
wide range of restrictive agreements (including those relating to common prices,
approved lists of dealers and the limitation of production) which affect the
supply of goods or commercial services for the British market. Such agreements
must be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading who is responsible for
bringing registered agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court. The
court, which was set up under the 1956 Act, has powers to prohibit the operation
of agreements which it decides are contrary to public interest. Registration and
judicial examination has applied to agreements relating to goods since 1956 and
2o8

to services since March 1976. Not all restrictive agreements are taken before the
court; there is a frequently used procedure by which those containing only
insignificant restrictions may effectively be exempted. The Secretary of State
for Prices and Consumer Protection may exempt proposed agreements of sub¬
stantial importance to the national economy or agreements designed to keep
prices down. Restrictive agreements relating exclusively to exports are not
subject to registration but they must be notified to the Director General of Fair
Trading (and to the Commission of the European Community if they fall
within its rules of competition).
Britain has a generous system of national incentives for industrial development.
Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in plant
and machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the whole
of such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in the year
in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 54 per cent initial allowance on new
industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down allowance of
4 per cent thereafter. Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged, and
overseas firms are offered the same facilities and incentives as those applying to
British-owned companies. Under the Industry Act 197^ other assistance may be
provided throughout Britain where it is judged to be in the national interest.
The Government has selected a number of key industries which have critical
roles in the economy but also some impediment to their increased efficiency and
is providing assistance in the form of grants, sometimes with the possibility of
additional selective assistance to enable these key industries to overcome their
problems.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and ship¬
building, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of regional
imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Financial and other
aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has been expanded
considerably over the years.
The map opposite shows those parts of the country where assistance is
offered by the Government to encourage industrial development and the move¬
ment of office and other service employment. The assisted areas cover the whole
of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and in England the Northern, North
West and Yorkshire and Humberside regions; parts of the South West and
East Midlands regions; and Oswestry in the West Midlands. There are three
different categories of assisted area; special development areas, where the eco¬
nomic situation and consistently high rates of unemployment give rise to the
most urgent need for assistance; development areas with similar but rather
less severe problems; and the intermediate area, where some assistance is
necessary but where the need is relatively less acute than in the other types of
area. Under the Industry Act 1972 regional development grants are available
in the assisted areas to help meet the cost of buildings and works on premises
used wholly or mainly for specified activities in manufacturing, construction
and mining and, in the special development and development areas only,

towards the cost of plant and machinery as well. These grants are not limited to
projects creating employment, and are thus available to help with impro\e-
ments and modernisation. In addition, they are not treated as reducing the
capital expenditure which qualifies for tax allowances.
The Industry Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects
which are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part of the
assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the usual forms
for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary rates of interest,
interest relief grants, removal grants and service industry grants. In the year
ended 31st March 1976 some £325 million was paid in regional development
grants under the Industry Act, and £75-5 million was offered in regional
selective assistance. Regional selective assistance is expected to lead to the
creation of 43,000 new direct jobs in the next five years.
The National Enterprise Board (see p. 206) set up under the Industry Act
1975 ^ intended, among its other functions, to stimulate investment and
employment in the areas of high unemployment. The Act enables the Secretary
of State for Industry to direct the board to act as a channel for selective financial
assistance on the same conditions as those that apply under the Industry Act
1972. The Scottish Development Agency Act 1975 and the Welsh Development
Agency Act 1975 enable the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales to
direct their respective Development Agencies to provide selective financial
assistance under the 1972 Act on a similar basis. The Industry Act 1975 also
enables regional development grants and selective financial assistance under the
1972 Act to be given to corporate bodies which have made planning agreements
(see p. 206) on the basis of the law existing at the time of the agreement.
Under the Finance Act 1967 a regional employment premium is payable to
firms with manufacturing establishments in the development and special
development areas.
Other forms of assistance available include the provision of modern factories
for sale or rent on favourable terms in the development and intermediate areas,
and grants to ease the transfer or establishment of a business and its key workers
in the development and intermediate areas. Factory building and estate manage¬
ment are the responsibility in England of the English Industrial Estates
Corporation and in Scotland and Wales of the Scottish and \\ elsh Development
Agencies. The Government also influences, in many cases, the location of in¬
dustry by requiring industrial development certificates for the building of
new factories and extensions to existing factories outside the development
areas. The purpose of this control is to direct potentially mobile projects towards
the areas of greatest employment need. In Scotland and Wales the administra¬
tion of regional selective financial assistance is the responsibility of the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales and is
carried on by the Scottish Economic Planning Department and the Welsh
Office respectively.
Britain is entitled to nearly 28 per cent of the funds allocated to the European
Regional Development Fund, set up by the European Community in 1975. For
the period 1975-77 the fund has been allocated some ^54° ndlli°n to spend in
regions of the Community suffering from problems of a preponderance of
agriculture, industrial change and structural under-employment. Britain’s
gross share of the fund was £35 million in 1975 and is planned to be about £58
million in both 1976 and 1977. Loans are also available on favourable terms
from the European Investment Bank and the European Coal and Steel Com¬
munity (see p. 74).

Within the Department of Industry an Industrial Development Unit helps
with the appraisal, negotiation and monitoring of projects referred to it and
also provides advice on request to the Scottish and Welsh Offices. An In¬
dustrial Development Advisory Board, made up of members prominent in
industry, banking, accounting and finance and international industrial invest¬
ment, advises on industry-wide problems and priorities, and considers
specific major cases for selective assistance. Scottish and Welsh Industrial
Development Advisory Boards have been established on a statutory basis to
advise the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales on the exercise of their
functions of providing selective financial assistance under the Industry Act
1972.
The Department of Industry’s regional organisation in England has an
important degree of authority for dealing with applications for selective financial
assistance. Regional industrial development boards operate in the North, North
West, Yorkshire and Humberside and South West regions. The boards advise
generally on regional industrial opportunities and on applications for selective
financial assistance for the development of industry in their regions. The links
between regional economic planning councils and boards (see p. 192) and the
department’s regional offices have been strengthened so that the process of
industrial regeneration in a region and the planning of its land use and other
physical resources can be properly co-ordinated.
The Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, set up at the end of 1971; and
the beginning of 1976 respectively, are working to stimulate industrial develop¬
ment in Scotland and Wales and to provide environmental facilities conducive
to such development. The agencies are responsible to the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Wales respectively and, in addition to an industrial investment
function similar to that of the National Enterprise Board, have responsibility
for the provision and management of industrial sites and premises (see p. 210).
In their environmental role, the development agencies are responsible for
rehabilitating land which has become derelict because of previous industrial
use and for improving the environment with an emphasis on areas in need of
economic regeneration.
Under separate legislation capital grants are available at 30 per cent of the cost of
new buildings, machinery and equipment for the manufacturing, construction
and extractive industries in Northern Ireland. Total expenditure, including
grants, qualifies for tax allowances. There is also provision for assisting firms by
means of loans to carry out major schemes of re-equipment, to move to another
area in particular need of industrial development or to undertake a rehousing of
their business in association with a major scheme of modernisation and re-
organisation. Help under the capital grants legislation is given without regard
to the number of jobs created.
As an alternative means of assistance in Northern Ireland comprehensive
and flexible powers are offered under the Industries Development Acts for
projects which offer a reasonable amount of employment. In such cases industrial
development grants of up to 40 per cent of expenditure on new buildings,
machinery and equipment are available, with tax allowances as above. For
those projects which offer exceptionally attractive returns in employment or
location within Northern Ireland, the assistance offered can include tenancy of a
government-built factory at low rent (including possibly a rent-free period),
grants towards operating costs in the initial stages, and grants towards costs of
removing existing machinery and installing it in a factory in Northern Ireland.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Since 1945 over 190 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and
others expanded with government assistance, and the number of people now
employed in grant-aided industry totals over 65,740.
Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associations
concerned with promoting local industry and sponsored mainly by local
authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry, including
the Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, to support the
efforts to attract new industry to Wales. In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands
Development Board, a statutory body, works to stimulate the economic and
social development of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. It provides
grants and loans to industrial, commercial and other enterprises; it may also
acquire land, provide management and other advisory services and set up and
carry on businesses. The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a
non-profit-making body, works to promote the general economic development
of Scotland.
Under the Development of Tourism Act 1969, the tourist boards in Great
Britain may give financial assistance to selected tourist projects in special
development and development areas. Britain’s national tourist organisation
consists of four independent government-financed statutory bodies (the
British Tourist Authority, which is responsible for the overseas promotion of
tourism in Britain and for certain general matters affecting the country as a
whole, and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards which are respon¬
sible for encouraging the development and improvement of facilities and
amenities for tourists in their respective countries, and for tourist promotional
work and publicity within Britain) and a separate statutory Northern Ireland
Tourist Board which receives assistance for tourist projects under separate
legislation.
The estimated total number of visitors to Britain in 1975, including visitors
from the Irish Republic, was a record figure of 8-9 million, an increase of 12 per
cent over the 1974 level. Their expenditure in Britain amounted to ^1,114
million.
Encouragement is also given to the development of rural industries. In England
and Wales, much of this work is done under the aegis of the Development
Commission set up under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act
1909 to encourage rural development; this service is provided by the Council
for Small Industries in Rural Areas (C0SIRA)1 acting in consultation with the
rural community councils through their small industries committees in the
counties. The Development Commission has funds to build small factories for
suitable industries to stop the depopulation of rural areas. Further assistance
in England and Wales is provided by the Council for Smaller Industries. In
Scotland this work is undertaken by the Scottish Development Agency and in
Northern Ireland by the Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU). All
these agencies provide advice and guidance to small businesses in rural areas and
country towns and finance for small factories to stimulate rural industries. In
addition CoSIRA and the Scottish Development Agency provide loans for
assistance to tourism in the rural parts of development areas.

and the Wales Tourist Board.

The following is a broad summary of the locational distribution of British
industry, grouped according to the eight standard regions of England, plus
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is one of the
world’s most important financial centres. Lying at the head of ocean navigation
on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities and largest ports,
though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to Tilbury docks.
It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufacture of clothing,
food and drink, furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and
many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these
industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the
central area) is well below the national average. London is also important,
especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and consumer goods
and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of leading research
establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a considerable drop
in employment and population in London.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries
there are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering
works and major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
There are centres of manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, in the
Medway towns and the Aldershot-Farnborough area.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, many of which are partly residential areas for people working in
London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a naval port with some
shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton is one of Britain’s
leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries include ship
repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol, the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial city,
having tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace, chocolate and metal
manufacture as well as a wide range of engineering and other industries; there
are extensive modern docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with
important basic chemicals and non-ferrous metal plants. Plymouth, with the
naval dockyard and electrical and other industries, is an important manu¬
facturing centre. The towns of Gloucester, Poole, Christchurch, Cheltenham
and Bath are major producers of machinery, instrumentation and other engineer¬
ing products. Swindon has vehicle, electrical and electronic engineering.
Chemical and engineering products are made at Yeovil, Taunton and Bridg¬
water. Clothing and other textile products and footwear are made at several
centres. In the Camborne, Redruth, Falmouth and St. Austell areas of Corn¬
wall there is china clay and tin mining, and machinery manufacture, ship
repairing and other forms of engineering.

BRITAIN I977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
has been made by the nine towns receiving overspill of population and industry
from London. The area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the
world and this has provided a firm base for the growth of the food processing
industry, which is concerned mainly with canning, and more recently freezing
local produce. Cambridge is a major centre of research-based industry ; Ipswich
and Peterborough are noted for diesel engines, agricultural machinery and
engineering generally and Norwich for footwear and food manufacture. The
east coast ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft are important bases for
companies associated with natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
This is the only landlocked region and it has a greater dependency on manu¬
facturing industry than any other region. However, more than three-quarters of
the land is still used for agriculture and includes some areas of great natural
beauty, particularly in the south and west. The main concentration of industry
is in the West Midlands metropolitan county which includes the districts of
Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolver¬
hampton. The economy is largely dependent upon the metal-using industries
and in particular on motor vehicle manufacture. Other notable industries are
mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, castings, tubes, locks,
jewellery, domestic metalware and rubber manufactures. The metropolitan
county also contains the new National Exhibition Centre, which is one of the
largest and most modern exhibition complexes in the world.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent,
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal¬
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and north Warwickshire areas.
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical
engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
The industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester noted for
hosiery and knitwear, shoes and a diversity of engineering products, Derby for
general engineering, aero-engines, railway research and engineering and man¬
made fibres; Nottingham for hosiery, cycles and a variety of engineering pro¬
ducts, lace, pharmaceutical products and tobacco; Northampton, footwear and
engineering; and Chesterfield, engineering. Northampton was designated a
new town in 1968 (see p. 167). Corby, a new town in Northamptonshire, has a
large integrated steel works. There are important deposits of iron ores and
limestone in the region and part of Britain’s richest and most highly mechanised
coalfield lies under the north-east of the area. Some of the towns on the coal¬
field, such as Mansfield, have important manufacturing industries, particularly
textiles. Lincoln is noted as an engineering centre.
The North-West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Department
of Industry’s administration of this region extends also into parts of Cumbria
and Derbyshire. The region is one of the most highly industrialised in Britain.

Manchester is Britain’s second most important commercial and financial
centre, serving much of northern England and is also an important port. Man¬
chester Airport is also the largest outside London and the south-east. It is one of
the chief centres for electrical and heavy engineering and for the production of a
wide range of goods including computers, electronic equipment, petrochemicals,
dye-stuffs and pharmaceuticals. Manchester’s traditional role as the centre for
the Lancashire textile industry is only a small part of its present-day activities.
The textile towns, while adapting to the decline of traditional textiles and to
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have seen engineering outgrow the textile industry. The largest
towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston, Rochdale, Burnley and
Bury, are diversified with such industries as paper-making, textile and electrical
machinery, light engineering and consumer durables, plastics, foods, chemicals,
electronics, aircraft and heavy commercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington, with
its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes, Runcorn with the chemical
industry, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching
the Mersey estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is famous for glass
manufacture. Liverpool, with its modernised dock system is one of Britain’s
leading seaports and, after London, the largest centre for processing imported
foodstuffs and raw materials (flour milling, soap, sugar refining and rubber
products). The centre of economic activity in Merseyside is still its port but its
industrial strength has moved from older industries closely related to the port
to the newer industries including motor vehicles, electrical engineering, heavy
industrial plant and chemicals. Employment in transportation and distribution
has been superseded by newer service activities including the National Giro
Centre at Bootle.
University research facilities in the region are closely linked with the region’s
industries. Industrial research units serve most industries and are of major
importance in the region’s development.
The region, although compact and second in industrial importance in
Britain, is extensively rural with some of Britain’s most fertile farmland. It has
four new towns and tourist centres such as Chester as well as seaside resorts
such as Blackpool and Morecambe.
The region has a major airport at Liverpool (Speke), a highly developed rail
system and one of the most advanced motorway networks in Britain, providing
good access throughout the region, and to the rest of the country and Europe
through the east coast ports.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country, including the Yorkshire
Moors National Parks and part of the Peak District.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. Important industries include a
wide range of engineering products, mechanised handling equipment, plastic,
packaging and printing machinery, vehicle components and electric motors,
metals and metal goods, coalmining, food-processing, drink, clothing, carpets,
chemicals and glass containers. About 70 per cent of Britain’s worsted and
woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the commercial
centre of the wool trade. The metropolitan district of Leeds is an important
commercial centre and also has a variety of industries including men’s clothing
and various engineering industries. In the south, the steel centre based on
Sheffield and Rotherham is noted for alloy and special steels, tools and cutlery.

Yorkshire’s coalfield is particularly important and production is to be extended
to the Selby area, where major new reserves have been discovered. The main
centres in the coalfield (Doncaster and Barnsley) are well positioned in relation
to communications, particularly to motorways, which makes them natural
growth points.
York, a leading tourist attraction, is also noted for chocolate and confec¬
tionery manufacture. It is an important railway centre and has substantial rail¬
way workshops. Humberside, with four ports, offers varied trading outlets to
overseas markets, particularly to the rest of Europe. Kingston upon Hull, the
other principal city in the region, has, in addition to port activity, industries
engaged in engineering, vegetable oil-processing, chemicals, sawmilling and
food-processing. The ports of Grimsby, Immingham, and Goole, the steel
town of Scunthorpe, and a variety of industries, including oil-refining, on
Humberside are of importance. The completion of the west-east motorway and
the Humber Bridge should assist the economic growth of the region.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and
the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an area
of hills, lakes and moorland and is relatively thinly populated. Most of the
population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from the
coalfields north of the River Tyne southwards to the River Tees.
The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manu¬
facture, shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical
plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe").
Europe’s largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the Teesside area.
At the same time other types of industry have been successfully established in
the region. It is one of the most important areas for the manufacture of electrical
plant, and the many other industries include mining machinery, rolling mill
plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing and
scientific instruments. An aluminium smelter is operating on the Northumber¬
land coast. Atomic energy is important in Cumbria, with two nuclear power
stations and other installations and considerable investment is taking place in
the coalmining industry to exploit large coal reserves below the sea bed off the
Northumberland and Durham coasts and to boost open-cast coal production.
The region is also involved in the North Sea oil programme.
Nearly two-thirds of the population (which totals 2-8 million) live in industrial
south Wales. Coalmining remains a major industry; although the numbers
employed in it have declined substantially, the area still produces virtually all
Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. Steel is
the other traditional industry of south Wales, which already supplies all of
Britain’s output of tinplate and much of its sheet steel. Many new industries,
including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle components,
plastics, chemicals and textiles have been established throughout the former
coalmining valleys and on the coastal plain. Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea are
the major urban centres and, with Barry and Port Talbot, are also the major
ports of the region, the latter with one of Britain’s largest steel-making plants
and a deepwater harbour for importing iron ore. Inland the main concentra¬
tions of population are Rhondda and Merthyr Tydfil, the largest centres in the
coalmining area.
The other main industrial area is north Wales. Here also coalmining has
declined, but the sheet steel, chemical and man-made fibre industries are

important employers. In addition, and particularly in the Wrexham area, newer
light industries, including domestic electrical appliances, have been introduced.
The remainder of Wales is still largely dependent on agriculture, forestry and
tourism although light industry has been introduced in many areas. Milford
Haven is one of the finest natural deepwater harbours in the world and has
developed as Britain’s major oil importing port. It has four major oil refineries
and also an ocean terminal which links it with Wales’ fifth refinery at Llandarcy
near Swansea. These five refineries together account for more than one-quarter
of Britain’s total capacity. Offshore, in the Celtic Sea, there is increasing interest
in exploration for oil and gas. There are two new towns in Wales at Cwmbran
in Gwent and Newtown in Powys.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5-2 million and most of the
industrial activity is concentrated in the central lowlands between the Firth of
Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a
major commercial centre, and Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, an administrative
and cultural centre. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding
and marine engineering centre; it produces a great variety of general engineer-
ing products, which include modules, pumps and other products for the oil
industry; the world’s largest oil production platform yard is situated at Ardyne
Point in the Firth of Clyde. Clydeside is also an important centre for food, drink
and tobacco manufactures, carpets and printing and publishing. The steel
industry, sited mainly in Central Strathclyde, is being modernised and capacity
expanded especially at Ravenscraig and Hunterston. The electronics equipment
industry is represented in Glasgow, Airdrie, East Kilbride and other parts of
Strathclyde, Fife and Dundee, as well as in Edinburgh, where this and other
modern industries are expanding alongside the long-established engineering,
printing and brewing industries. Large-scale plants producing cars in Linwood,
near Paisley, and commercial vehicles in West Lothian and the Scotstoun
district of Glasgow are well established, while heavy earth-moving equipment
and tracked vehicles are produced in Uddington and Airdrie. The chemical
industry is concentrated at Saltcoats and at Grangemouth, where a major oil
refinery provides much of the basic raw material. The Firth of Clyde provides
central Scotland with valuable deepwater facilities and a new ore terminal is now
under construction at Hunterston and there is a major container terminal at
Greenock. There are important coalmining works in the Strathclyde, Central,
Lothian and Fife regions.
Outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentration in and
around Dundee and Aberdeen and numerous towns outside these areas have
attracted light industry in recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture,
jute, has been supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches, refrigera¬
tors and electronic products.
North-east Scotland is now the centre of the offshore oil industry and a
wide variety of oil-related projects have been established alongside the
older industries of whisky distilling, paper manufacture and food and fish
processing.
Much of the rest of Scotland is mountainous and therefore sparsely populated.
In the Highlands and Islands, the main industries include high quality tweed
and knitwear, papermaking and aluminium smelting and there are significant
resources of hydro-electric power. Nuclear power is also generated. The
development of North Sea oil has led to very substantial oil-related activities
including oil platform production yards and a new oil refinery is planned at
Nigg. In the Borders and south-west of Scotland, the wool, cloth and knitwear

industries are important, together with food processing and chemicals manu¬
facture. The whole of Scotland is important as a holiday and recreational centre.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and lacking in
minerals, there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and
around Belfast, the capital city. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast;
other well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile
machinery and a wide range of other engineering products, ropes, tobacco and
clothing. Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles
it is particularly well known for linen. The textile industry is, however, exten¬
sively diversified and Northern Ireland is one of the most important areas in
Europe for man-made fibre production. There has also been extensive develop¬
ment in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments,
telecommunications equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber.
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water) was in 1975 lower than in the last few years and
only 1 per cent higher than in 1970. Manufacturing production, as measured
by the index of industrial production, has fallen sharply in recent years,
although it has increased by 112 per cent since 1948, the highest increases being
in chemicals and allied industries, in coal and petroleum products and in
engineering, with instrument engineering and electrical engineering the
sectors that grew most rapidly.

By international standards, the productivity of British industry as measured by
output per head, has shown a relatively slow rate of growth, increasing y
io-8 per cent in manufacturing industries between 1970 and 1973. Since 1973,
output has fallen as a result of the recession but the labour force has fallen less
quickly, so that output per head has decreased. Both the long-term and the
INDUSTRY
219
Investment
short-term growth of productivity are influenced by such factors as the rate of
capital investment, management, advances in products, machinery processes
and methods of work, sales promotion and labour. Over the last decade the
size of the labour force employed in industry has fallen steadily.
The improvement of productivity rests mainly with unions and management
in individual enterprises. It is also a prime objective of the Government’s
industrial strategy. The Department of Industry is responsible for co-ordinating
measures to improve industrial productivity. It is represented on the EDCs
(see p. 206) and the other working parties set up under the industrial strategy
programme. The Department assists the introduction of advanced machinery
and techniques into industry, provides technical advisory services and sponsors
the Computer Aided Design Centre and the National Computing Centre. It is
concerned directly with research into such factors as productivity measurement
techniques, group technology and production engineering. The Department of
Employment advises firms on aspects of productivity connected with manpower
utilisation and industrial relations. Many educational establishments also
provide advice and assistance.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Productivity Council is one of many bodies, both public
and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The council
provides information and advisory services to industry through a national
network of more than 50 local associations.

Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Investment in manu¬
facturing industry tends to reflect the level of demand in the economy as a
whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in output and the
implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since 1961 there have
been three discernible cycles. Investment fell from a peak in 1961 to the
beginning of 1963, then rose to a new peak in 1966. It then fell again in 1967,
rose to a peak at the end of 1970, fell in 1971 and 1972 and achieved a new peak
in 1974. Details of investment in the period 1966-75 are contained in Table 14.

a After allowing for expenditure brought forward into 1968 from 1969 to secure the
higher rate of investment grants, estimated at £51 million.
Part of the investment in plant and machinery is associated with the intro¬
duction of new techniques and equipment. The process of automation is giving
rise to far-reaching changes in the pattern and organisation of industry and has
already been responsible for substantial increases in production and efficiency.
Much investment, however, still consists of replacements, additions and
improvements of a more traditional kind. Industrial technologies of plant
maintenance, lubrication and corrosion protection, well developed in Britain,
make possible large savings in costs.
In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and training. The British Institute of Management (BIM) which
is independent, non-political and non-profit making, provides a wide range of
information services and has a particular interest in management education and
training, throughout industry, commerce and public administration. The
Institute of Directors also provides information and other services to directors
of all types of company. The Industrial Society, whose membership includes
trade unions as well as employers and their associations, works to promote
better use of human resources; it advises members and conducts conferences
and courses.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education (see
p. 156). Training courses for higher management are held at several universities
and colleges, including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-Thames,
and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. There are graduate
business schools in London and Manchester and in Scotland and both graduate

and undergraduate management courses offered in a number of universities.
The Council of Industry for Management Education, jointly sponsored by the
CBI, the BIM and the Foundation for Management Education, works to
foster the development of business and management education. The larger
firms, especially those with wide responsibilities, often provide general
management courses for senior executives, and systems of informal training
within an organisation are numerous. There are also a number of bodies con¬
cerned with specialised branches of management, for example, the Institute of
Personnel Management, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of
Administrative Management, the Institute of Supervisory Management and
the Institute of Marketing.
The large number of professional people working as management con¬
sultants indicates the concern for improved management performance in
Britain. Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas
clients.
Design is an important factor in improving the quality and competitiveness of
manufactured goods.
The Design Council exists to improve the design of goods manufactured by
British industry. It is a government-sponsored body and members of the council
are appointed by the Secretary of State for Industry. A separate Scottish
Committee directs the council’s activities in Scotland. The council’s industrial
and field officers advise on design matters and on engineering design problems.
The council also operates a Designer Selection Service, through which any
organisation can obtain the services of qualified industrial designers.
At the council’s Design Centres in London and Glasgow there are permanent
displays of well-designed modern British goods, together with special exhibi¬
tions illustrating new design developments. There is a third, smaller showroom
in Cardiff. All the products displayed are chosen from the council’s Design
Index, a record of some 9,000 current British products, chosen by independent
committees for their high standards of design, safety and performance.
Other services provided by the council include the organisation of product
. displays at overseas trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design, help for
design education and the publication of a range of material. It provides annual
Design Council Awards for manufacturers of consumer and engineering
products and for medical equipment and motor vehicles.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 400), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design in
industry. The Crafts Council of Great Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great
Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are all grant-aided and work to improve
craft design and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter, funded in part by sale of standards, by sub¬
scription and by government grant. It prepares and promulgates standards
which, variously, lay down criteria for safety, performance, dimensions, testing
methods and codes of practice for a vast range of products and processes in
most fields of production. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manu¬
facturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements. BSI is governed by a council consisting of

PROTECTION
BRITAIN 1977" AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.
There is in Britain a comprehensive system of legislation and machinery to
protect the consumer’s economic and other interests. Although certain aspects
had already been a function of several government departments, consumer
protection’s growing importance was recognised first by the appointment in
1972 of a Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs, a post which was trans¬
formed into a Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection in 1974 and
secondly by the establishment under the Fair Trading Act 1973 °ffice
the Director General of Fair Trading. The Director General of Fair Trading
keeps consumer affairs continuously under review. He can initiate action to
control certain types of unfair trading practice and act against individual
traders who persistently contravene criminal law or are in breach of their civil
obligations to consumers. He encourages trade associations to adopt and publish
voluntary codes of practice and himself publishes material to inform consumers.
The Director General of Fair Trading is also concerned with competition
policy (see p. 207) and with administering the system established under the
Consumer Credit Act 1974 of licensing businesses involved in credit and hire
transactions. The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection is imple¬
menting the Act in stages to replace previous legislation on credit, including
hire purchase and hire. The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973
guarantees the consumer’s basic rights in transactions for the purchase of goods
—that is, that the goods correspond to their description and are of merchantable
quality and fit for their purpose. Other important legislation (which differs in
some respects for Northern Ireland) includes the Weights and Measures Act
1963 which establishes a uniform system of weights and measures and provides
protection against short weight and short measure in commodities; the Food
and Drugs Act 1955 and the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 which control
the purity, hygiene and description of food; the Consumer Protection Acts
1961 and 1971 which empower the Government to make regulations to ensure
the safety of any class of goods; and the Trade Descriptions Acts 1968 and 1972
which make it an offence to describe goods inaccurately or make certain kinds of
false statements about services. The Prices Act 1974 makes it possible to require
prices or unit prices to be marked on goods offered for sale. In the main, this
type of legislation is enforced by the Trading Standards Departments and other
branches of local government. Independent consumer councils for each of the
nationalised industries investigate consumer complaints, while some trade
associations in industry and commerce have established codes of practice
designed to protect the consumer and look into complaints about member
firms. The National Consumer Council, established in 1-975, together with the
Scottish and the Welsh Consumer Councils, ensures that the consumer s view
is made known to those in Government and industry whose decisions affect
consumers.
Where necessary, consumers can seek legal redress through the simplified
procedure introduced in 1973 in the county courts in England and Wales (see
p. 98) and the sheriff courts in Scotland. Information and advice are made
available to consumers throughout the country by the Citizens Advice
Bureaux (see p. 119) or by consumer advice centres run by local authorities.
In addition a number of private organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association, funded by the sub¬
scriptions of its membership of over 700,000. The association conducts an
extensive programme of comparative testing of goods and investigation of
INDUSTRY
223
services; its views and test reports are published in its monthly bulletin
Which? or its satellite publications. The association also provides an advice
service on subscription. Consultancy work in European legislation is under¬
taken by the association on behalf of the Department of Prices and Consumer
Protection. Local consumer groups, whose representative body is the National
Federation of Consumer Groups, also promote consumers’ interests and
provide information and advice.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
An outline of the broad sectors of manufacturing industry is given below. (For
coal and petroleum products see Chapter 13.) Production figures in Table 15
show the relative size of the sectors. Expansion has been particularly marked in
those industries using advanced technologies such as electronics, the newer
branches of mechanical engineering, instrument engineering, most sectors of
the chemical industry and man-made fibres. In other long-established in¬
dustries (for example, shipbuilding and marine engineering and electrical
engineering) extensive reorganisation, re-equipment and modernisation have
become essential to meet changing economic conditions.
A major stimulus has been provided by the various needs of the offshore oil
and gas industries.

Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, today the world’s seventh largest steel-producing nation. The Iron and
Steel Act 1967 brought together into public ownership 14 major steel companies
and created the British Steel Corporation (BSC). BSC currently produces over
85 per cent of Britain’s crude steel. It employs some 220,000 people, of which
180,500 are involved in iron and steel manufacturing and 39,500 in other
activities, such as foundries, construction and chemicals. The remaining private
sector companies are represented by the British Independent Steel Producers
Association. The private sector, which employs some 115,500 people, accounts
for over one-third of the value of the industry’s turnover and is particularly
strong in the manufacture of alloy and stainless steels and of finished products
for the engineering industry. The main steel producing areas are Yorkshire and
Humberside (32 per cent of crude steel output in 1975)) Wales (27 per cent),
the Northern region (17 per cent), Scotland (10 per cent) and the West Midlands
(8 per cent). .
BSC is currently implementing a ten-year development strategy, adopted in
1973, which is designed to modernise and expand the corporation s production
capacity. A major feature of the strategy is the replacement of open-hearth
steelmaking by basic oxygen steelmaking (for bulk production) and the
electric arc process (for more specialised tasks). Over the period to 1982-83,
BSC plans to concentrate its bulk steelmaking at five mam sites which have
good access to deep water for iron ore imports. Since 1974 the Government,
BSC and the trade unions have been engaged in a joint review of the plant
closures implied in this strategy; decisions on most of the plants concerned
have now been announced. Schemes for new investment to a value of over £$00
million have been confirmed in the course of this review of closures. Steel
production in Britain is closely linked with international developments and
world demand and is very responsive to changes in the economic situation.
About four-fifths of production is used by home industry and the remainder
for direct export. The major export markets for steel are the rest of the European
Community, the United States and Sweden. A large part of the steel used by
industry in Britain is also subsequently exported as part of other finished
products.
In the production of iron castings, a few large firms are responsible for more
than a quarter of total output while fewer, more highly developed units are
replacing the numerous small foundries. The main users of iron castings are

the motor vehicle industry, the general engineering industry, the manufac¬
turers of pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries
and the steel industry. The Government is providing financial assistance for the
modernisation of the industry.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Its major products are aluminium (both virgin and secondary
metal); secondary refined copper, lead and zinc. Britain is also a major pro¬
ducer of the newer specialised metals including uranium, zirconium and beryl¬
lium for the nuclear energy industry, niobium for aircraft production and
selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for electronic apparatus. Nearly
half the industry is situated in the Midlands. Other centres include south
Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where a zinc smelter of some
100,000 tonnes capacity operates. Three large-scale aluminium smelters
provide over half of Britain’s requirements for primary aluminium. Firms are
engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing:
advanced techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also
employed. Scientific and technological research for the industry is conducted
by the British Non-Ferrous (BNF) Metals Technology Centre. The main
products exported, including alloys and semi-finished products, are copper,
nickel, aluminium, lead, tin and zinc. Exports of silver, platinum and other
metals of the platinum group totalled over £160 million in 1975. The major
export markets for the whole industry are the United States and the Federal
Republic of Germany.

The mechanical engineering industry comprises a group of industries manu¬
facturing all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechanical
handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. About half
the industry’s production is for the home market. The major customers for the
heavy equipment sectors are the nationalised fuel industries, the chemical
industry and the British Steel Corporation. A wide range of equipment is
supplied to the building and construction industry. Demand for other types of
equipment comes from all the production industries in Britain. A number of
sectors are increasing their export surpluses, despite British industry’s need

for a wide range of machinery at present supplied by imports, and there has
been a substantial increase in the volume of orders received from the oil-
producing countries.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry and many
advanced types of metal cutting machine tools are produced in Britain.
Rationalisation of the industry is causing the bulk of manufacturing capacity to
be concentrated in the hands of fewer companies: the ten largest manufacturers
account for some 50 Per cent of total production. Government assistance is
being given to promote the development of new products, to rationalise existing
ranges and to improve production facilities and machinery. Dependent as it is
on the growth of manufacturing industries and their investment plans, demand
for the industry’s products is highly cyclical.
About one-quarter of all metal cutting tools are lathes: other important
groups are metal forming machines and grinding, honing and lapping machines.
Manual control for many tools is being replaced by automatic control and
Britain is a major producer of numerically controlled machine tools, including
drilling machines, lathes and machining centres. The two largest export
markets for the industry in 1975 were the United States and South Africa. The
Machine Tool Trades Association represents most of the industry and is
responsible for the international machine tool exhibition held in Britain every
four years, the next being due in 1980. The Machine Tool Industry Research
Association carries out research into design and performance of tools and into
production methods.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including
process) plant and steelwork (for nuclear power station construction see
Chapter 13). Of particular importance are fabricated products such as pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil refining (process)
plant, steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power
stations), sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement
kilns, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and fabricated steel¬
work for bridges, buildings and industrial installations. The industrial plant
industry comprises both equipment manufacturers and contractors responsible
for the design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete plants
for process industries. British manufacturers have contributed to major ad¬
vances in process technology: there has been a rapid expansion in the number of
plants completed for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas in¬
dustries and British firms are carrying out major plant projects in many
overseas countries. Substantial new business has been generated by North Sea
oil and gas operations. Gas turbine engines for industry, in particular for power
generation in the fuel industries, are another thriving section of the industry.
Three large firms are pre-eminent in the manufacture of industrial engines,
including those derived from aero-engines. Industrial pumps, valves and
compressors are vital components in many industrial processes, particularly
in the chemicals, oil and electric power industries: over half the production
of all types of such equipment is exported. The fluid power industry makes oil
hydraulic and pneumatic equipment for operating machinery and construction
and other equipment. There are many new areas where these powerful and
flexible systems may be used.
Machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and
fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres are produced by the
textile machinery industry in Britain, which is noted for the range, scale and

versatility of its operations. Although there have been valuable developments
elsewhere, British inventions have remained the foundation of many textile
processes in use internationally and progress has been made in developing
automation in the industry. Research and development is carried out by the
large firms and the four research associations connected with the textile
industry. Machinery for food and drink preparation, processing and sterilisa¬
tion is another important sector.
Refrigerating machinery (excluding domestic equipment) is used for food
and drink processing, but the industry also covers plant for ships and vehicles
and equipment for conserving drinks, food and ice-cream for the distributing
and catering industries.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is pro¬
duced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment, pile
drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of construction
equipment and of mining machinery and equipment, including coal cutting and
coal face loading machinery, are increasing. Mechanical handling equipment
is used not only for construction and related activities but throughout industry
generally. It extends from individual units and accessories to complete
operating systems, the main products being cranes and bridge transporters,
lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered industrial trucks.
Electronic control and completely automated handling systems are among the
techniques developed in recent years.
Britain has an important export trade in agricultural machinery and implements
(for tractors, see p. 230) and continues to develop a wide range of equipment for
general and special use, including many special purpose machines such as
hop-picking machines, fruit harvesters and improved root harvesters. Mechan¬
isation is being used increasingly in the arable farming, livestock and dairy
farming sectors. Much of the new machinery is designed for use in a variety of
conditions to meet the needs of overseas farmers.
Sales by this industry have been expanding rapidly. Some of the new technology
has been developed by multinational companies and the British subsidiaries or
associates of overseas firms are prominent in various sectors. The industry
includes non-electronic data processing and handling equipment, duplicators,
typewriters, accounting machines and cash registers, and electronic calculators
(for electronic computers and data processing equipment, see p. 229).
The other major products of the industry include printing, bookbinding and
paper goods machinery, space heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment, packaging and bottling machinery, portable power tools and
miscellaneous non-electrical machinery, such as boot and shoe-making
machinery, laundry equipment, automatic vending machines, plastic working
machinery and other types of specialised equipment.
Alongside the firms manufacturing the products of the mechanical engineering
industry are enterprises whose main functions are to supply parts and com¬
ponents and to undertake general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work.
Particularly important is the production of ball, roller, needle and other
bearings, about one-quarter of which is for the motor vehicle industry, and of
other components, such as precision chains.

Instrument engineering is a particularly important sector of the engineering
industry. Electronic techniques are becoming widely used, particularly in the
industrial instrument sector, which comprises industrial and process measuring
and control instruments and equipment, optical instruments and appliances,
electrical measuring and testing instruments, analytical instruments and a
diverse group of others. About half the market for analytical instruments is in
the medical field. The chemicals, power, petroleum and iron and steel in¬
dustries account for about 80 per cent of process control applications, the
largest sector of the industry and one which is expanding. Major advances have
been made in automatic testing equipment and analytical instruments for
medical diagnosis and pollution control. The industry is served mainly by five
trade associations—the Scientific Instrument Manufacturers Association, the
Control and Automation Manufacturers Association, the British Industrial
Measuring and Control Apparatus Manufacturers Association, the Electronic
Engineering Association and the British Photographic Manufacturers Asso¬
ciation. The Sira Institute conducts research on behalf of the industry.
Photographic equipment includes photographic and cinematographic
cameras, projectors and document copying machines. Other sectors of the
instrument industry are concerned with watches, clocks and time recorders and
with surgical instruments and appliances and related products.

The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and installa¬
tion of a wide variety of equipment, which includes all types of generating,
transmission and distribution equipment, motors, telecommunications and
broadcasting equipment and domestic electrical appliances. The electronics
industry, which makes a vital contribution to the efficiency of many branches of
the economy, has become one of the most important sectors of British industry.
Leading representative organisations are the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers Association, the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic
Appliances and the Electronic Engineering Association, a member of the

Electrical
Engineering

229
Conference of the Electronics Industry which brings together the six principal
trade associations for the electronics industry. Scientific and technological
research is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
British scientists and engineers were responsible for many of the basic advances
in the generation and transmission of electric power and British firms have
continued to be important suppliers of machinery and equipment. Mergers
have led to the creation of one of the leading electrical and electronic engineering
groups in Europe for producing equipment used in generating, transmitting
and distributing electric power. The main product categories are power
equipment—generators, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers—and
switchgear, starting and control gear.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telecommunication networks and other purposes; its products include
submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials. Four
major groups are responsible for more than half the industry’s output and for
a large proportion of the world’s submarine cable requirements.
A few large firms also dominate the market for other electrical goods,
including domestic appliances. Domestic equipment includes heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, vacuum
cleaners, irons and electric kettles. Other major sectors are electrical equipment
for motor vehicles and aircraft; electric lamps and light fittings, and batteries
and accumulators.
The British electronics industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive
in Europe and British scientists and companies have made important contri¬
butions to electronics technology. Because of the diversity of the range of
products, an exact definition must be arbitrary, but the sectors included are
telecommunication equipment, components, consumer goods, computers and
communication and other capital equipment, as well as electronic process
control and industrial instrumentation (see p. 228).
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques
is increasing as new switching systems are introduced. The main products are
telephone exchange equipment, switching equipment for telegraph and telex,
data transmission equipment, subscribers’ apparatus and long-distance
communication equipment. The Post Office accounts for some two-thirds of
the home market, which is largely supplied by three companies and carries out
research and development work in co-operation with companies.
The components sector manufactures the whole range of active and passive
electronics components, including integrated circuits (in which many circuits
are accommodated on a tiny chip of semiconductor raw material), mainly for
the electronics equipment industry. The market is dominated by the United
States manufacturers and their subsidiaries.
The major consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, radio¬
grams, high-fidelity audio equipment and tape recorders. Demand for the goods
is particularly affected by credit controls and Government fiscal policy. In the
audio field, British manufacturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but
are less strong in the mass market.
In the computer sector, an extensive range of computer systems, central
processors and peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data
processing and scientific work to mini- and micro-computers for use in control
and automation systems, are produced. Essential to the sector is the ‘software’
industry, which produces programs and associated services and complements

the hardware industry, enabling the systems manufacturers to provide complete
solutions to meet the requirements of users.
An expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufacture of
radio communication equipment, radar and radio navigational aids for ships
and aircraft, alarms and signalling equipment, public broadcasting equipment
and other capital goods. British equipment is used extensively overseas, for
defence, civil aviation, shipping, health, educational and other purposes.

The industries which manufacture transport equipment are a particularly
important source of overseas earnings, accounting for some 17 per cent of
total visible exports in 1975.
In its widest context the motor industry comprises the manufacture of cars and
commercial vehicles, wheeled tractors, caravans and trailers, and motor cycles
and also of separate parts and components. Output is dominated by four large
groups (British Leyland, Ford, Chrysler United Kingdom and Vauxhall)
which account for over 98 per cent of car production and some 93 per cent of
commercial vehicle output; the remainder is in the hands of smaller, specialist
producers of heavy commercial vehicles, buses, coaches, limousines and sports
cars. The principal trade association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, which holds an annual motor show and a commercial vehicle exhibi¬
tion every two years. The Motor Industry Research Association carries out
collective research on vehicles and components. In the three categories of
exports (cars, commercial vehicles and parts and accessories) there is a positive
balance of trade although the proportion of the market held by imported cars
has increased. Large numbers of cars are exported in a form suitable for assembly
overseas. The principal individual overseas market for British cars is the
United States. Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of commercial
vehicles, including goods vehicles, buses and coaches, the main market being
South Africa.
Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of wheeled tractors produced.
Production is dominated by two large firms, with three others responsible for
most of the remainder. Britain supplies about one-quarter of total world
exports of tractors.
In recent years the motor cycle industry has contracted and the domestic
market is largely supplied by imports.
The British Railways Board and a small number of firms in the private sector
build locomotives, carriages and freight wagons for British Rail, for industrial
users and for export.

Britain’s aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in
the world, producing civil and military aircraft, helicopters, guided weapons,
hovercraft, space vehicles and a comprehensive range of aircraft and airfield
equipment and systems. The construction of aircraft has hitherto been dom¬
inated by two large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter concern;
outside these groups are a few important smaller companies and a large number
of components and systems suppliers. The Government is carrying out plans
to take four companies—British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley
Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation—into public
ownership under a new corporation, British Aerospace. Almost all aero-engine
manufacture is in the hands of Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd., a publicly owned com¬
pany within the National Enterprise Board. Besides extensive research and
development work by the industry itself, research on a substantial scale (cover¬
ing airframes, aero-engines, equipment and space systems) is carried out by
government research establishments. The industry is represented by the
Society of British Aerospace Companies, which organises a major international
air show and exhibition at Farnborough, Hampshire, every two years. Pro¬
duction and exports in the industry are fairly evenly divided between aircraft
and parts and engines and parts. Another substantial sector is guided weapons
and parts. The leading markets for exports are the United States, France and
the Federal Republic of Germany.
Current production includes such civil aircraft as the Hawker Siddeley
HS 748, Trident and HS 125 executive jet, the BAC One-Eleven, the Britten-
Norman Islander[Trislander light transports and the Shorts Skyvan. The test
programme for the Shorts SD3-30 commuter airliner, which is in production,
was completed early in 1976’ The Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport
started service in January 1976' Military developments include the unique
Hawker Siddeley Harrier vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (which has
achieved substantial sales to the United States), the Hawk advanced trainer
aircraft, the Anglo-French Jaguar tactical fighter/operational trainer and the
Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, now designated the Tornado, a collaborative
development by Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. The
Puma, Gazelle and Lynx helicopters are collaborative developments by Britain
and France, together with a number of guided-missile projects. The industry is
also extensively involved in the manufacture of space systems, including
satellites for communications and scientific research in other European
collaborative programmes (see p. 405). Britain is the world’s leading producer
of hovercraft, the Winchester (SRN 6) and Mountbatten (SRN 4) classes having
been sold extensively overseas. British aero-engines are also in world-wide use;
recent types include the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for the Harrier and
similar aircraft, the advanced technology RB 211 ultra-quiet engine, and its
more powerful derivative, the RB 211-524, an engine developed for aircraft of

Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding; its industry is the fifth
largest in the world. Employment in the industry has contracted in recent years
and there have been programmes of reorganisation in some major shipyards. It
is proposed that 19 of the larger shipbuilding companies, 12 ship-repairing
companies, five companies manufacturing slow-speed diesel marine engines
and three training companies and their subsidiaries should be taken into public
ownership under a new public corporation, known as British Shipbuilders. In
addition, a number of yards in the private sector build smaller vessels, including
patrol boats, fishing and harbour craft, pleasure craft, supply vessels, drilling

ships and oil rigs. About 30 per cent of the output of British yards is for export.
Some of the larger shipbuilding firms, in addition to the specialist ship repair
firms, carry out repair work. Various types of marine diesel engines, steam
turbines and gas turbines are constructed and fitted by specialist firms. The
industry is represented by the Shipbuilders and Repairers National Association
and co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association.

A range of metal products other than those described in previous sections are
produced by a group of industries made up of a very large number of firms. One
of the main groups, in which small firms predominate, manufactures engineers
small tools and gauges, which include jigs and fixtures, press tools and moulds,
hard metal-tipped tools and other metal cutting tools. Another group manu¬
factures cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and blades); this
industry’s reputation has been built on the skill of its craftsmen, although today,
except for the highest quality wares, mass-production methods are generally
used. Although small firms predominate, seven relatively large concerns are
responsible for over half of output.
A wide variety of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets and dustbins,
made mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, are produced by the hollow-
ware industry, together with industrial hollow-ware, such as kegs, drums and
barrels. The manufacture of hand tools, including files, saws, hammers, axes
and spades, is a long-established industry. About half of its total production is
for export. Jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious metals is
an industry in which British craftsmen are world famous: five relatively large
firms are responsible for nearly three-fifths of total output. Other main groups
of metal goods are bolts, nuts and screws, cans and metal boxes, metal furniture,
metal windows, metallic closures, metal small-ware such as needles and pins,
safes, locks and keys, domestic gas appliances and dropforgings.

The chemicals industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of British industry
and an important contributor to overseas earnings. In 1975 it accounted for 11
per cent of total British exports. The industry is undertaking a substantial
investment programme. One major British chemical group, the fourth largest
in the world, accounts for about 20 per cent of chemical sales in Britain. A
further 30 per cent is in the hands of 24 other large- and medium-sized com¬
panies. The industry as a whole is represented by the Chemical Industries
Association. Research and development work is financed by the companies
themselves. The rest of the European Community and the United States are
the major export markets.
About one-fifth of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric acid
and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for industry.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture of
such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals.
Sulphuric acid is produced in larger quantities than any other chemical. The
remaining output of this sector consists of a very wide range of chemicals. Over
four-fifths of the output of organic chemicals is made up of petroleum-based
chemicals. The most important products (by weight) are ethylene, propylene
and benzene. The main outlets for organic chemicals are plastics materials,
solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents. Radioisotopes are
produced by the Radiochemical Centre Ltd.: over half the centre’s production
is for export.
The whole range of drugs is produced in Britain, where many of the basic
products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics, sulphon-
amides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccine
sera and naturally occurring drugs.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of industry.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which
the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—notably
for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide range of
industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene (a material used for
toys, light mouldings and many consumer goods). One of the newer thermo¬
plastic materials is polypropylene, which can be fabricated as mouldings, films
and fibres. A new family of plastics materials reinforced with carbon fibres is
also in commercial production in Britain; they have up to three times the
strength but are only half the weight of steel. High styrene rubbers for shoe
soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is required, are
also in large-scale production, together with neoprene rubber.
The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by two firms, together with a
number of firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal con¬
stituents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the
domestic market. The use of ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and
urea is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers. Notable discoveries by the
British crop protection industry include the insecticidal property of BHC

(benzene hexachloride), the first selective hormone weed-killer, MCPA, and
Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide. Herbicides are the largest
category of sales of pesticides and allied products.
In recent years many improved techniques have -been introduced into the
paint and varnish industry, including new ranges of synthetic resins and
pigments, non-drip, quick-drying paints and paints needing only one applica¬
tion. Britain is one of the largest exporters of paint in the world.
The industry includes soap and detergents and toilet preparations, cosmetics
and perfumes. Three large companies are predominant: many of the firms in
the industry are owned or financed by United States companies but there are a
number of long-established British perfume and soap makers.
Other products of the industry include formulated adhesives, printing ink,
colours and dyestuffs, photographic chemical materials and floor and furniture
polishes.

The historical branches of the industry, based on the natural fibres of cotton
and wool, linen and jute, have retained their separate identities but the
boundaries between them are becoming blurred with the increasing use of
man-made fibres. The growth of man-made fibres has stimulated the develop¬
ment of new processes and new types of yarn and cloth and has strongly
influenced the structure of the industry. A small number of large multi-fibre,
multi-process groups have emerged, although in many sectors there is still a
preponderance of small firms engaged in just one or two operations.
Research for the industry is provided by the Shirley Institute (cotton, silk
and man-made fibres), the Wool Industries Research Association, the Hosiery
and Allied Trades Research Association and the International Wool Secretariat.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain and
continuing extensive research has produced a wide variety of types with their
own special characteristics. The two main types are still those first developed—
the cellulosic fibres, such as rayon, and the synthetic fibres, such as nylon and
terylene, made wholly by chemical processes. Terylene, a polyester fibre
developed in Britain during the second world war, is especially suited to blend¬
ing with wool. Acrylic fibres, including Courtelle (a British discovery), Acrilan
and Orion are important products, as are the elastomeric or spandex fibres
which have inherent properties of stretch and recovery, anti-static synthetic

yarns embedded with carbon and various fire-resistant yarns. More recently
there has been a greater use of the polyolefins (polypropylene and polyethylene)
in the carpet and carpet baching and packaging fields and still more recently in
household textiles and clothing. Output in the man-made fibre industry is
concentrated in the hands of a few large firms and has expanded rapidly in
recent years.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary extensive re¬
organisation, modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Pro¬
duction includes single and double cotton yarn, spun man-made fibre and
mixture yarn, woven cotton cloth and man-made fibre and mixture cloth. The
Irish Republic and Denmark are the most important markets.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The wool textile industry, of importance to Britain since mediaeval times, is
one of the largest in the world. There are two main sectors, woollen and wor¬
sted. An increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool. West
Yorkshire is the main producing area but Scotland and the West of England
are also famous as specialised producers of high quality yarn and cloth. Large,
but declining, quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain for the
production of wool for spinning. The largest markets for woollen and worsted
fabrics are Japan and the rest of the European Community.
The hosiery and knitwear industry includes four or five large producers and a
wide variety of smaller ones. The products of the industry range from knitted
or crocheted outerwear and fabrics to socks, stockings, panti-hose and
accessories.
Carpets
Jute
Other Textile
Industries
Some two-thirds of the output of the carpet and rug industry is made up of
tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually with a high man¬
made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Woven carpets, such
as Axminster and Wilton, account for most of the remainder of sales. There is
a higher wool content in woven types, although they too are making more use
of man-made fibres. The volume of tufted carpets exported is now almost
twice as large as that for woven ones, but the high quality and variety of design
of the latter make Britain the leading producer of woven carpets.
Jute products are manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area. Jute yarn
and the man-made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacture of carpets,
cordage and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the
packaging, upholstery, building and motor car industries. New uses for jute,
for example as a plastics reinforcement, have also been developed.
British textile firms manufacture a wide variety of other goods, including lace,
narrow fabrics and household textiles, such as blankets, sheets, towels and
tablecloths. Rope, twine, nets and netting are manufactured by the cordage

industry, which is one of the largest in Europe. A recent development by
British manufacturers is the production of non-woven fabric by the melded
process, in which the conventional weaving and knitting stages are omitted.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe. It has shown
considerable flexibility in adapting to the needs of new fabrics, to changing
patterns of demand and different markets and to the impact of international
fashion. The industry operates in the context of the world market and many
subsidiary companies have been established overseas. Although production has
been mechanised to a large extent, the industry remains labour intensive,
skilled, individual work being required at various stages of garment manu¬
facture. The Clothing Export Council, which represents a major part of the
industry, co-ordinates the promotional activities of the industry.

the Rossendale valley region of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and
Norwich on women’s and girls’ shoes.

About two-thirds of the bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process developed by the industry s principal
research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association,
and now widely used in other countries. Three groups are predominant. In
smaller bakeries production of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually
allied to bread production. Biscuits and related products are a major sector of
the industry and have gamed a world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain
milling and the production of various specialised flours and meal.

The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small firms.
A substantial proportion of total world exports of chocolate and sugar con¬
fectionery are supplied by Britain.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. In addition to the output of quick-frozen
fish, small quantities are also canned.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and
vegetables, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces. Other products of the food
processing industry include sugar, sugar preparations and honey, dairy
products and eggs, vegetable and animal oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and
spices and cereal preparations.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and
in the food and drink industry as a whole, is whisky. Scotch whisky, which
accounts for almost all whisky production in Britain, was first distilled in the
fifteenth century; most well-known brands are blends of anything between 15
to 40 different single whiskies, some distilled from malted barley and some from
other grains. Scotch whisky is required by law to be kept in wooden casks for
at least three years, but is usually matured for an average of five years. About
four-fifths of annual sales are to overseas buyers; the United States imports
nearly half of the distilled alcoholic beverages exported from Britain. Japan is
the second largest market. Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since
the early 1950s. One company accounts for a large proportion of output. Some
of the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad.
In the brewing and malting industry there are seven major brewery groups
whose products are sold nationally and a number of smaller enterprises who
mainly supply locally. Firms have introduced new production methods,
including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch production
plants are well established. The main raw materials used are malt, hops and
some sugar. Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some
brewers make their own malt, others buy it from independent maltsters, who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers and malt extract manufacturers. British
malt is used by brewers throughout the world.
Three major groups account for much of the cider and perry produced in
Britain. The industry is based in Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire. A small
viticultural industry produces wine from grapes grown in vineyards in England.
Imported grape and fruit juices are used in the production of most of the
limited quantity of made wine.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There
are some very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are marketed
on a national scale, while other firms supply regional markets. There is some
specialisation among firms in the production of various types, such as car¬
bonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and
‘mixers’, fruit juices and health drinks.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and tobacco goods
sold in Britain. Two big manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent of
total output. Exports, mainly of cigarettes, are shipped to a large number of
overseas markets, including Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and Belgium.

Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay- ware and heat-resisting products, including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manu¬
facture is now based on highly mechanised systems. Building bricks are made
mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory goods include
firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite bricks and
alumina bricks.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of
continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity of the
industry has been substantially expanded in recent years.
The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the
industry; kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced almost all the coal-fired
kilns, and new decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic
machinery have been introduced. Domestic pottery, including china, earthen¬
ware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham, accounts for about half of the industry’s
output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical
ware, and such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous
ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production of tableware is concentrated in
two major groups. Britain is the world’s principal manufacturer of fine bone
china; famous makes include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal
Doulton, Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various forms is organised
for quantity production, much of it in the form of ‘float’ glass, a process develop¬
ed in Britain and licensed to glassmakers throughout the world. The use of glass
for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly
increased in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the
motor and other industries. Other products include tubular glass, mirrors,
lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types
of glass containers (mostly made automatically). A traditional product is
hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality. Collective research is
undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research Association, and much
research work is also carried out by the Department of Ceramics, Glasses and
Polymers of Sheffield University.

The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. The larger
British groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and paper
producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the Common¬
wealth and Europe. In recent years paper production has concentrated on
printing and writing papers and boards and speciality grades. There has also
been a trend towards waste-based packaging grades, in order to reduce the
industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. Domestically produced
woodpulp represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies and the
use of recycled waste paper is increasing: together they currently provide some
54 per cent of the industry’s needs. New techniques for recycling waste paper
are being developed and a scheme of Government assistance aimed at directly
encouraging the increased use of indigenous raw materials was introduced in
1976. The main types of paper and board produced are printing and writing
papers and board, packaging board, wrapping papers, newsprint, household
tissues and industrial and special purpose papers.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of con¬
verted products, including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging and
business stationery products.
The printing and publishing industry produces a wide range of products,
including national and provincial newspapers, periodicals, books, business
stationery and greeting cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups
in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing,
engraving, bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially
industries of small firms. Production processes include the latest developments
in high-speed printing equipment, including electronic engraving and advanced
processes of photographic reproduction and several provincial newspapers use
computer typesetting techniques. The Book Development Council of the
Publishers’ Association promotes the export and use of British books overseas.
The most important overseas markets for printed matter are the United States
and Australia.

other vehicle components and accessories. One recent major development has
been the introduction of tyre systems which enable the vehicle to continue
safely after puncturing. The largest tyre group in Europe came into being in
1971, following the merger of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre company and
its Italian equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of
United States and other overseas companies. The industry’s consumption of
rubber includes natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms predominating. New
designs and materials are incorporated into modern furniture; traditional
designs are reproduced by skilled craftsmen. The industry comprises wooden,
metal and plastic furniture, upholstery, bedding and soft furnishings. A
Development Council for the industry has existed since 1949* Scientific
research and technical and other information services are provided by the
Furniture Development Council and the Furniture Industry Research Asso¬
ciation.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units.
Domestic production of timber has been steadily increasing but the timber
industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies.
Plastics Products In addition to the plastics components and accessories supplied to many
different industries, the plastics products industry manufactures a wide range
of building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and
other products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle, furniture
and other industries; rigid foams; packaging products, including bottles,
containers and bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware, many kinds of
household goods, linoleum, vinyl and other floorcoverings and leathercloth.
Toys, Games The industry manufactures toys, games, sports equipment and children’s
and Sports carriages. The greatest expansion has been in the field of craft and hobby kits.
Equipment British diecast toys are well known overseas; about half of the output of toys
and games is for export. The Federal Republic of Germany and the United
States are the major markets.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total
domestic income, includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair
and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and sewerage
systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore structures,
electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal prospect¬
ing and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and hydroelectric
power stations and telecommunications. About i-8 million people are engaged
on construction, including the self-employed, and they represent some 6-8 per
cent of the total labour force. About 20 per cent are employed by public
authorities. Some 30 per cent of output consists of maintenance work, and
about 49 per cent of all new work is commissioned by public authorities.
Structure Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1974 about 90 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were 64,000 firms employing
two or more people nearly 91 per cent of them employed fewer than 25 people.

Projects
Public authorities as a whole employed about 226,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these were engaged on repair and maintenance work for
local authorities.
Nearly 41 per cent of operatives were occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £2,600 million annually. The total labour force included about
700,000 skilled craftsmen (of which about 90,000 were apprentices), most of
whom had been trained under the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. The
apprenticeship period is four years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a client,
embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans and the
supervision of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency, which is an integral part of the Department
of the Environment (see p. 48) is responsible for the construction programmes
undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed services,
both in Britain and overseas. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for co-ordinating research and development throughout the government
service and seeks to influence methods and techniques in the building industry
as a whole. A Construction Industry Liaison Group was set up by the Govern¬
ment in 1975 to improve consultative arrangements between the Government
and the construction industry.
The value of work done in 1975 amounted to £11,566 million, of which £1,285
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by public
authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £10,281 million
(£7,929 million on new work and £2,352 million on repair work).
Some 322,300 houses and flats were started in 1975 and 311,780 were com¬
pleted, of which 149,580 were for private owners. Of the £2,935 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £1,528 million, or over half, was for
private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised build¬
ing methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the adoption of
advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical advice and
services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
The Association of Building Centres represents the interests of the 12
building centres throughout Britain most of which provide both a compre¬
hensive permanent exhibition and information services on building materials
and products, building services and techniques.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment to
carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1976 were
conventional and nuclear power stations (see p. 267), offshore production
platforms and onshore terminals for North Sea oil, hospitals, large-scale housing
developments, a scheme to extend the London underground railway system to

Heathrow Airport, London, and the first stage of the new Fleet underground
line in London, and roads, tunnels and bridges.
Among important new construction projects being undertaken by British
building and civil engineering contractors in overseas countries are: a US
$200 million contract for the first stage of an irrigation scheme in Peru; a £46
million contract for a highway in Iran; a £20 million contract for the first phase
of a new airport in Saudi Arabia; a £34 million contract for several buildings
and a highway in Muscat and Oman; an £18 million contract for a hospital in
Qatar and two contracts worth £ 13 million for road building and a water supply
scheme in Nigeria.
British building and civil engineering firms are active in over 100 countries.
In 1974-75 value °f new overseas contracts totalled about £1,125 million.
A substantial and growing amount of overseas business is also being done by
British architects and surveyors, as well as by other types of consultant. At the
beginning of 1976 British members of the Association of Consulting Engineers
were engaged on projects worth nearly £ 15,000 million which will bring in some
£130 million net in invisible earnings.
Increased opportunities for construction exports led to the setting up in 1975
of the Construction Exports Advisory Board to provide a focus for government
support. The board advises the Secretary of State for the Environment and the
Secretary of State for Trade on the selection of companies to pursue particular
construction projects overseas; and generally, on ways of harnessing additional
resources in the construction industry and professions to meet export
opportunities.
Within the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Establish¬
ment (BRE) is concerned with all aspects of construction research. In addition,
the Building Research Advisory Service of the BRE provides technical advice
over a wide range of construction problems. An Agrement Board, tests and
certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations. The Construction Industry Research and Information Association
is concerned with structural design, civil engineering construction, building
design and construction, earthworks and foundations, hydraulic and public
health engineering, and underwater engineering. The Building Services
Research and Information Association deals with heating, air conditioning,
electrical, plumbing and other services in dwellings and commercial buildings.
The application of materials is the main concern of the Timber Research and
Development Association and the Cement and Concrete Association. Other
research associations deal with bricks, paint, plastics in building, welding and
civil engineering hydraulics. The major construction firms have research depart¬
ments working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with
research include the universities and colleges of technology. Most of the pro¬
ducers of primary building materials have trade associations which maintain
research institutions chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient use for
their materials.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, packaging materials)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by

TRADES
RETAIL TRADE
Organisation
and
Turnover
INDUSTRY 243
which home-produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p. 200.)
While some of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers to
retailers, sales are also made directly to consumers through producers’ own
selling organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order
businesses), and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
There have been several major official statistical inquiries into the distri¬
butive trades. For wholesale trades, a large-scale inquiry was carried out in
respect of 1965, and more recently for 1974, while for service trades there was a
large-scale inquiry into the catering trades for 1969 and into motor trades for
1972. The 1971 Census of Distribution covered the retail and certain service
trades. Sample monthly, quarterly and annual inquiries are also undertaken.
The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are groceries and provisions,
petroleum products and ores and metals. The book value of stocks held by
wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1975 was about £3,600 million; fixed
capital expenditure by wholesale distributors amounted to about £130 million
in 1975 (valued at 1970 prices).
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
may sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly,
is sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold (or sent on a commission basis), to primary wholesalers
who dispose of the produce either to secondary wholesalers or direct to retailers;
alternatively the grower may deal direct with retailers or may sell his crop, under
contract, to a food-processing company for canning or freezing. The sale of
some agricultural products is regulated by statutory marketing boards.
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs. Every year the new Covent Garden market handles up to 1 million tons
of fruit and vegetables, and about 170,000 tons of carcase meat and 49,000 tons
of poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the principal
distributing centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The sales of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incorporated
organisations, amounted to £1,100 million in 1975.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses has increased in recent
years. By bulk purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises and
credit and delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to their
customers. There are about 500 warehouses of this type with total sales of over
£1,000 million a year. Cash and Carry wholesalers account for about 40 per
cent of all grocery warehousing by turnover.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four main headings: (1)
multiple traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies;
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches); and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms and mail order
businesses (see p. 246). Multiple traders have tended to bypass the wholesaler
by having their own buying and distribution organisations. In response many
244
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
wholesalers have joined with independent retailers to form voluntary organisa¬
tions. This has helped to preserve the existence of retail outlets for the whole¬
saler and has given to smaller retailers the advantages of bulk-buying and co¬
ordinated distribution without significant loss of independence. About 28,000
grocers’ shops, nearly a third of all independent grocers, are members of
voluntary groups.
The 1971 Census of Distribution covering retail and certain service trades
in Great Britain, recorded some 473,000 retail establishments (Table 16).
Out of this total, grocery and other food retailing groups numbered nearly
198,000 and the clothing and footwear group over 81,000.

Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of electricity
and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by about 40 per cent between
1966 and 1971, after allowing for price changes, the increase in volume of sales
was about 8 per cent. Rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied appre¬
ciably between different types of trade. The slowest growth was in confec¬
tionery, tobacconist, newsagent, clothing and ‘other food’ sectors. The fastest
growth was in department stores, mail order business, combined gas and
electricity showroom sales, household goods, groceries and provisions, and
‘other non-foods’. However, the growth of sales on a commodity basis has been
affected by increased diversification. The results of the 1971 Census of Distri¬
bution indicate a continuation of the trend for a larger volume of trade to be
handled by rather fewer shops, particularly in the food sector, along with the
continuing expansion of large multiple firms relative to other types of shop.
Independent shops accounted for about half of the value of Britain s retail
trade, although they made up more than four-fifths of the number of shops.
According to the Department of Industry’s monthly retail sales inquiry, the
value of all retail sales in Great Britain in 1975 was estimated at £28,000 million

an increase of about 75 per cent on 1971. However, after allowing for increases
in retail prices, the increase in the volume of sales was about 8 per cent.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Seven
shops had a tutnover in 1971 exceeding ^10 million. At the other extreme there
were some 6,500 shops with a turnover of less than £1,000 a year. In addition
there were market and street traders, whose volume of business may be very
small. About 2-5 million people were employed in retail shops in 1971.
Fixed capital expenditure by retail distributors in 1975 amounted to about
£370 million (at 1970 prices).
In Northern Ireland the value of all retail sales increased by 64 per cent
between 1971 and 1975 to reach an estimated figure of £760 million.
According to the 1971 Census of Distribution there were over 66,700 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1971 with a total
turnover of over £6,000 million; their share of total turnover was about 38,6 per
cent.
Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1975 were over £2,000 million,
being about 7 per cent of all retail trade. Their share of food shops turnover
was some 11 per cent.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by
their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited to
£5,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally paid on
the shares. One large society has introduced a scheme of bonus shares carrying
a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. A large number of societies, account¬
ing for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced dividend
stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account, at
different redemption rates.
At the end of 1975 there were 227 retail co-operative societies. Amalgama¬
tions are rapidly diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was
1,015). The largest single society in Britain is Co-operative Retail Services
Limited which in 1975 had 27 branches and a turnover of £287 million.
Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings, but the decline has been partly
reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p. 243) and between
1966 and 1971 the number of independent shops fell by only 3 per cent. The
1971 Census of Distribution also observed that the independent shops’ share
of trade continued to fall (to 54-3 per cent); however, they still play an important
role, often in terms of convenience, service, and range of goods stocked. The
proprietors of some smaller shops have other means of livelihood.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or
more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities, notably clothing
and household goods. There were 818 department stores in Britain, according
to the 1971 Census of Distribution, with a turnover of £950 million: 242 were
owned by multiples; 343 by independents; and 233, with a turnover of nearly
£160 million, by co-operative societies. Between 1966 and 1971 sales by
department stores rose by some 45-5 per cent.

The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1971 there were over 28,000 stores operating wholly or partly on
self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of 1961 and fewer
than 500 in 1950. This development has been accompanied by a trend to larger
shops in terms of both floor space and staff, though the number of staff per
square foot of floor space has tended to decrease.
Supermarkets are defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling area of
2,000 square feet (186 square metres). According to estimates of the Institute
of Grocery Distribution there were 5,900 supermarkets in 1975 with sales of
£3,500 million. Their share of total retail grocery sales amounted to some
45 per cent.
The number of very large stores, generally known as ‘hypermarkets’ and ‘super¬
stores’, is increasing. They generally operate a selling area of between 20,000
and 100,000 square feet (1,860 and 9,290 square metres respectively); hyper¬
markets having a minimum selling area of 50,000 square feet (4,645 square
metres). These stores operate on supermarket lines but with a much wider
range of goods including food and non-food items. They are generally associated
with exclusive car-parking facilities and situated away from established central
shopping areas.
Mail order trading, through a mail order business or direct from retailer,
wholesaler or manufacturer was one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain between 1961 and 1966. Its growth rate slowed between 1966 and 1971,
but has since increased again. The 1971 Census of Distribution showed that
turnover was £633 million (excluding wholesalers and manufacturers mail
order sales), accounting for nearly 4 per cent of total retail sales.
Some 31,790 mobile shops and market stalls were reported in the Census of
Distribution for 1971, with sales amounting to £147 million. Co-operative
societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against
12 per cent in ordinary food shops. Mobile shops were mainly concerned with
food sales; about two-fifths were travelling grocers, and greengrocers and
butchers each accounted for over one-fifth. Only a small proportion were shops
not selling food, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
There are about 500,000 automatic vending machines in use in Britain, many
of them installed in offices and factories. It has been estimated that sales from
vending machines in 1971 totalled some £155 million while sales from the
62,500 machines in use in the retail trade totalled some £12 million. The main
items sold in them are cigarettes, drinks, confectionery, prepared foodstuffs
and other commodities such as postage stamps.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competitions,
gift schemes, and stamp trading. Trading stamps are normally exchanged for
goods but, by law, have to be marked with a cash value and, where their aggre¬
gate value is £0-25 or more, redeemed for cash on request.
Sales by the 26 manufacturing and importing companies which are members of
the Direct Sales and Service Association Limited and which sell all their
products directly to consumers amounted to about £400 million in 1975*

The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as
cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers, has
been greatly helped by instalment credit facilities including hire purchase.
Total new credit extended by finance houses and retailers in Great Britain in
1975 amounted to £2,987 million, 19 per cent more than in 1974; about 60 per
cent was advanced by retailers and the rest by finance companies.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating in Northern Ireland amounted in 1975 to £49-7 million.
The credit card is widely used in Britain. The cards enable users to have their
signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The
issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money from
the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
About 2-2 million people in Great Britain were employed in trades offering a
service directly to the public in 1975.
There were over 130,000 establishments concerned with catering (defined to
include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) in Britain in 1969. There were 203 catering contractor
organisations and over 18,000 industrial and office canteens.
The value of total turnover of all caterers in 1975 was £5,100 million, just
over double the 1969 figure. Turnover of licensed hotels and holidays camps
increased by 116 per cent to £880 million and that of public houses by 111 per
cent to £2,800 million.
In 1971 there were over 8,400 laundry, launderette, dry cleaning and towel,
linen and overalls hiring organisations. Turnover in 1971 amounted to some
£212 million.
There were 46,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1972 with 55,000
establishments and a total turnover of £8,100 million. These trades include
motor repairers, distributors, garages and petrol stations. Between 1967 and
I975 motor trades’ total turnover increased rapidly by about 41 per cent.
Sales of new vehicles accounted for some 32 per cent of the 1975 total, and
sales of second-hand vehicles for 15 per cent. Sales of accessories, receipts from
sales and servicing and sales of petrol and oil accounted for the remaining 53
per cent.
The 1971 census recorded some 47,200 hairdressing establishments with a
total turnover of £166 million. About two-thirds of the number are ladies’
hairdressers.
In 1971 there were some 5,500 boot and shoe repair establishments, the number
having fallen by over a quarter since 1966; takings in 1971 were £22-4 million,
slightly below the 1966 level.
In Britain the expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and
standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for example,
ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been major
factors in the changes which have taken place in packaging methods. Packaging
products of paper and board remain the most extensively used (turnover of some
248

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£1,115 million a year), one of the fastest growing sectors being paper sacks
(£78 million in 1975). Other important materials are tinplate, plastics and glass.
New uses are being found for tinplate, especially in sales of soft drinks and
beer. The use of plastics continues to develop; annual sales of polyethylene
film and film products amount to 91,992 tonnes and 120,290 tonnes respectively,
while the annual sales of low-density polyethylene bottles has risen to about
617 million, providing further competition for the traditional glass bottle.
About £967 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1975; RS a proportion of the gross national product (1 ’04 per cent) and of con¬
sumer expenditure (1-5 per cent), it is the lowest since 1956. About £649
million was spent on display advertising and £318 million on classified,
financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is carried out by
agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer research and
other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of Practitioners
in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry, including agencies,
advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible
for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of
advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understanding
of their work and objectives. Many have their own public relations advisers and
staff, while consultancy firms provide general services and assistance for special
public relations activities. The Institute of Public Relations, founded in i94^>
has some 3,000 members in commerce, industry, the professions, national
associations, and central and local government.
13 Energy and
Natural Resources
Over half of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from domestic fuel
minerals (defined, for the purposes of this handbook, as coal, oil and natural
gas), and minerals in general make an important contribution to the economy.
The approximate value of minerals produced in 1975 was £2,890 million, of
which coal contributed 71 per cent and natural gas 7 per cent. The discovery
of commercial oilfields on the British Continental Shelf is increasing the
importance of domestically produced fuel minerals to the economy very
considerably. Over the past ten years the production of non-fuel minerals has
been increasing, particularly in terms of value.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are.obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Ownership of Apart from gold, silver, petroleum, natural gas (which are owned by the
Mineral Rights Crown) and coal, all minerals in Great Britain are privately owned. On
Britain s Continental Shelf the right to exploit all minerals except coal is
vested in the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal, or license others to do
so, both on land and under the sea, is vested in the National Coal Board.
Normally, ownership of minerals runs with the ownership of the land surface
but in some areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these rights
have become separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coal, are usually
carried out by privately owned companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and
nuclear power are used in Britain, together with some water power; second¬
ary sources produced from these are electricity, coke and small quantities of
town gas. Over half of all primary energy consumed comes from indigenous
sources. Inland consumption of energy amounted to 3197 million tons of
coal equivalent in 1975, 3-8 per cent lower than in 1974. The share of oil—
almost all of it imported—in total energy consumption expanded rapidly
from under 10 per cent in 195° to a peak of 48 per cent in 1972, but has since
fallen. It is expected that offshore oil will be equivalent to or even exceed
Britain’s oil requirements by the early 1980s when almost all the energy
consumed in Britain could be derived from indigenous sources. Although
coal has accounted for a declining proportion of energy consumption, a
major capital investment programme has started to end the contraction of
the industry. The share of natural gas in total consumption has increased
substantially, supplies from the North Sea discoveries having expanded
rapidly since the first quantities were piped ashore in 1967. Natural gas
accounts for nearly all the gas consumed in Great Britain. A programme for
the establishment of nuclear power stations has been in progress since 1955
and nuclear power now provides a significant share of electricity supplies.
250
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of most of the petroleum
industry and part of that concerned with the extraction of natural gas, are
under public ownership. The publicly owned fuel and power industries in
Britain employ in total some 600,000 people, 2-3 per cent of the working
population, and their annual turnover is about ^7>500 million and capital
investment about £1,400 million. In Great Britain the Secretary of State for
Energy is responsible for these industries, except for electricity in Scotland
which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The
appropriate Secretary of State appoints members of the boards and approves

their capital investment programmes. Investment is financed from internal
resources and by borrowing from the Government’s National Loans Fund
and from other sources. In each of the publicly owned fuel industries there
are statutory bodies set up to protect the interests of consumers.
The Government’s energy policy is to ensure the best use of indigenous
resources and so reduce the dependence on imports, particularly of oil.
Britain, which has the richest energy resources of any member State of the
European Community, is co-operating fully in the development of the
Community’s energy policy, the basic objective of which is to reduce depen¬
dence on imported energy supplies to 50 per cent of requirements by 1985.
Britain is one of the 18 members of the International Energy Agency, an
organisation within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop¬
ment,-which is engaged on a programme of international co-operation to deal
with world energy problems. The European Community is involved in
wider international discussions on energy as part of the Conference on
International Economic Co-operation.
Trends in primary energy consumption are shown in Table 17 and in the
diagram on p. 250. In 1975 petroleum accounted for 42 per cent of primary
consumption, coal 36-9 per cent, natural gas 17-1 per cent, nuclear power 3-4
per cent and hydro-electric power o-6 per cent. In 1975 consumption of natural
gas increased by 4*6 per cent, and coal by I-8 per cent; consumption of
petroleum fell by 10-5 per cent, hydro-electric power by 9-5 per cent and
nuclear electricity by 9-2 per cent.
Energy consumption by final users in 1975 amounted to 55,874 million
therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis. Industrial users consumed about 40 per
cent of the total, domestic users 26 per cent, transport 22 per cent, public
services about 6 per cent and agriculture 1 per cent. Energy consumption

In 1974 the Government announced a comprehensive programme of measures
designed to conserve energy. Measures introduced have included the
doubling of the standards of thermal insulation required in new dwellings;
the installation of improved control equipment, draught-proofing and
additional insulation in government buildings; compulsory limits on heating
levels in commercial and industrial buildings and restrictions on the use of
electricity for external display and advertising during daylight hours; lower
speed limits (see p. 302); the encouragement of energy-saving investment in
industry by the provision of financial assistance in the form of government

loans; government discussions with local authorities and other public bodies
on the scope for, and methods of achieving, energy saving; and a major
government publicity campaign to promote the efficient use of energy.
Conservation measures, including the publicity campaign and increased
energy prices (part of the Government’s policy to eliminate subsidies to the
nationalised fuel and power industries), have produced energy savings of at
least 2 per cent of primary energy consumption.
The Secretary of State for Energy is assisted by proposals on the promo¬
tion of energy efficiency from the Advisory Council on Energy Conservation.
In addition, efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic
users, is promoted by bodies representing producers and consumers and by
the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The main research organisations of the fuel and power industries conduct
research into methods of using energy efficiently. Research is also proceeding
on alternative sources of energy, of which the most promising is considered
to be sea waves. The Energy Technology Support Unit advises the Secretary
of State for Energy on the need for further research into non-nuclear forms
of energy.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. In 1913—the peak production year—the industry
produced 287 million tons of coal, exported 94 million tons and employed over
a million workers. c ^ n \
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and fourteen members. The NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive

rights over the extraction of coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license
private operators to work small mines and opencast sites. It has no monopoly
in distribution and retail sales remain largely in private hands, although it
makes bulk sales to large industrial consumers. Two holding companies,
wholly owned by the NCB, run most of its non-mining activities. NCB
(Ancillaries) Limited’s responsibilities include certain retail fuel distribution
operations, computer services and engineering services. NCB (Coal Products)
Limited is responsible for solid smokeless fuel manufacture and chemical
and by-products plants.
At the end of March 1976 there were 241 NCB collieries in operation
grouped into 12 areas, each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB.
The main coal-bearing areas are shown on the map on p. 254.
Coal accounted for 90 per cent of primary energy consumption in 1950, but
growing competition from oil and gas and the elimination pf steam trains on
the railways contributed to the fall in demand from the mid-1950s. In
1975-76 internal consumption of coal was 120-3 million tons, of which 62
per cent went to power stations, 15 per cent to coke ovens and 9 per cent to
domestic users.
Exports of coal and coal briquettes in 1975-76 were 1-4 million tons,
almost all of which went to Western European countries. In 1975-76 imports
amounted to 4-7 million tons.
In 1975-76 output of 123-8 million tons comprised 112-6 million tons from
the NCB’s deep mines, 10-2 million tons from opencast mines and 1 million
tons from licensed mines and other sources. The fall in demand during the
1950s and 1960s was accompanied by increases in productivity in the
industry and resulted in a rundown of the labour force at NCB mines from
some 700,000 in 1947 to 244,000 in March 1976. Productivity as a whole has
risen by about one-quarter since 1965-66 to 2-2 tons per manshift in 1975 -76;
at the coal face it has more than doubled over the last 20 years to 7-8 tons per
manshift in 1975-76.
Higher productivity has been achieved by concentrating on the more
productive collieries and coalfaces and by using advanced machinery and
techniques, including machines which cut and automatically load coal on to
conveyors, self-advancing powered roof supports and improved underground
transport and communications. Mechanisation has been extended to nearly
all coalfaces. Table 19 shows the main trends in the industry since 1965.
In 1975-76 the NCB’s income was £2,194 million including sales of coal of
£1,671 million and grants under the Coal Industry Acts of £32-4 million. The
operating profit was £52-2 million; after interest payments and other items
there was a net surplus of £5-3 million. Government assistance to the industry
took the form of grants towards the social costs of mine closures and contribu¬
tions towards the mineworkers’ pension scheme. The NCB’s borrowing limit
was raised from £700 million to £1,100 million under the National Coal Board
(Finance) Act 1976 and may be increased up to £1,400 million subject to the
approval of the House of Commons.
Capital expenditure on collieries amounted to £211 million in 1975-76. In
1974 the Government, the NCB and the coalmining trade unions carried out a
tripartite study of the policy towards the coal industry. As a result the Govern¬
ment accepted the board’s Plan for Coal as a general strategy for the follow-

ing ten years, involving maintenance of deep-mined capacity at the annual
level of around 120 million, tons and an increase in opencast production
to 15 million tons a year. Plan for Coal involves new capital investment of
some £1,000 million on major projects over the period to 1985 in order to
provide capacity of 42 million tons a year, including 20 million tons a year
from new mines, to replace that lost by exhaustion of old collieries. Authorisa¬
tion has already been given for 68 major capital investment projects, costing
a total of over ,£230 million, which will secure 89,000 jobs. In addition, the
NCB has a project costing about ,£4°° million for a mining complex at Selby
(North Yorkshire) which would produce 10 million tons of coal a year. About
,£40 million was invested in the two years to the end of March 1976 in schemes
to exploit reserves off the north-east coast of England.
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, there are still some 45,000 million tons of
known coal deposits judged to be workable, of which about 5,000 million
tons are known to be economically viable. The NCB’s national exploration pro¬
gramme is proving fresh reserves of economically workable coal at the rate
of 500 million tons a year, four times the annual consumption of coal. By
March 1976 there were 23 land exploration rigs in operation.
In 1975 76 the NCB spent ^18-7 million on research. It has two research
organisations: the Coal Research Establishment, at Stoke Orchard, Glouces¬
tershire, concerned with the combustion and utilisation of coal; and the
Mining Research and Development Establishment at Stanhope Bretby,
Staffordshire, for research on mining methods and equipment, including
underground transport and coal preparation. There are also scientific control
staff in the coalfields and a large operational research organisation. Much of
the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establish¬
ment (SMRE) (see p. 347)> closely related to the board’s problems; the
range of work at the SMRE includes explosions, fires, dust hazards, gas
detection, engineering and metallurgy.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the
NCB with several countries. Britain is taking the lead in formulating a coal

research and development programme on behalf of the International Energy
Agency; a programme of five coal research projects, including a £13 million
project to study fluidised bed combustion (a method of steam-raising for
power generation which uses low-quality coal and leads to lower pollution),
is being based in Britain. NCB (IEA Services) Limited has been set up to
manage these projects.
Seismic prospecting for natural gas and oil in the British sector of the Conti¬
nental Shelf, mainly in the North Sea, has been going on since the early
1960s and full-scale exploration activities since 1964, following the enactment
of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 and the subsequent award of a first round
of licences. Further licences were issued in 1965* I97° an<^ I97I_72) an<^
Government is holding a new round of licensing in 1976. The total area now
under licence is some 35,800 square miles (92,700 square kilometres) out of a
total area, over which Britain has exercised its rights to explore and exploit the
seabed and subsoil, of about 237,000 square miles (614,000 square kilometres).
Work on the development and production of natural gas and oil discovered
in the British sector of the Continental Shelf is proceeding rapidly. By the
end of 1975, 557 exploration or appraisal wells and 239 production wells
had been drilled or begun; of these 115 and 21 respectively were drilled in
1975-
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and
Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In
the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting,
but between the two world wars it was displaced from this function by
electricity. It is now used for domestic cooking and heating and for many
industrial and commercial purposes, supplying 13-9 million customers.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
100,000 people are employed, under public ownership and control in 1949-
The industry’s structure was adapted under the Gas Act 1972 ^a^e account
of the change from manufactured to natural gas necessitating more centralised
control of production and transmission. The British Gas Corporation came
into operation in 1973 taking the place of the Gas Council, the former central
co-ordinating body in the industry, and assuming the responsibilities of the
12 area gas boards formerly carrying out the local manufacture and the dis¬
tribution of gas to consumers. In connection with its main duty of developing
and maintaining an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas
supply and of satisfying reasonable demands for gas, it has powers: to
search for and extract natural gas and any petroleum discovered in the course
of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire, transmit and distribute gas;
to manufacture, supply, or sell by-products; and to manufacture, install,
maintain or remove gas plant and fittings.
Natural gas is not available in Northern Ireland and the industry, which is
controlled by 13 municipal undertakings and private sector companies, uses
town gas produced from oil.
The main single source of gas in Britain is natural gas, supplied either
directly or as feedstock for town gas manufacture, and accounting for 98 per

cent of total gas supplies. Between 1970 and 1975 the quantity of gas available
for public supply increased by 104 per cent to 14,005 million therms.
The first commercial gas discovery in the British sector of the North Sea
was made in 1965. Six major gasfields are now in production: Leman Bank,
West Sole, Hewett, Indefatigable, Viking and Rough. The Frigg field, which
straddles the boundary between the British and Norwegian sectors, is expected
to come into production in 1977* Gas produced in association with oil in the
Brent field is expected to be available in 1979-80 and, together with gas from
the Frigg field, should provide over one-third of Britain’s gas supplies by
1980. Gas has also been found in a number of smaller structures and in
association with oil in a number of other fields; exploration is continuing.
Total proven gas reserves remaining in the British sector of the Continental
Shelf at the end of 1975 amounted to 815,000 million cubic metres and total
possible reserves amounted to 1-4 million million cubic metres. The consequent
reduction in manufactured gas supplies has led to the closure of many gas¬
works; there were 40 in March 1976 compared with 227 in March 1966.
Some town gas manufacturing plant has been adapted for producing substi¬
tute natural gas (SNG). The British Gas Corporation is undertaking various
coal gasification projects at its Westfield (Fife) Development Centre in
collaboration with groups of sponsors.
The pipeline system commissioned in 1964 for the delivery of liquefied
natural gas imported from Algeria has been expanded to form a national
high-pressure pipeline system for transmission of natural gas derived
mainly from British fields in the North Sea. The first pipeline to deliver
natural gas to the shore, at Easington in Humberside, was put on flow in
1967. Since then further pipelines have been laid to bring natural gas to the
terminals at Bacton, Norfolk, and Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire. A pipeline
is being built to connect the Frigg field to a terminal under construction at
St. Fergus (Grampian) and another pipeline is planned between the Brent
field and St. Fergus. By March 1976 some 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometres) of
pipeline were in operation. The central transmission system is supplied by
eight feeder mains from the three North Sea shore terminals, and from the
Canvey Island terminal for liquefied Algerian gas. Construction of the
terminal at St. Fergus and of some 700 miles (1,127 kilometres) of new
transmission pipeline to carry gas to Scotland and northern England should
be completed in 1976. Investigations are being made into projects involving
various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions.
Liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas have been constructed
near Coatbridge (Strathclyde) and Partington (Greater Manchester), and
others are under construction oreplanned.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation is for industrial and
commercial purposes and the remainder for household use. Total consump¬
tion increased steadily during the 1960s and has risen rapidly during the
1970s. Sales of gas in Britain reached 13,112 million therms in 1975* 3*5 P^r
cent more than in 1974. A phased programme of converting all gas appliances is
nearly complete. About 93 per cent of consumers in Great Britain had had their
appliances converted at the end of March 1976 snd the switch to natural gas
should be completed by late 1977-
Gas has traditionally been used extensively in industries which require the
control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the

pottery industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel
products. Natural gas not required by the fixed tariff domestic, commercial
and small industrial markets is being used in bulk fuel markets and as a
chemical feedstock. In 1975, 5,016 million therms of gas were sold to industry
in Britain, 858 million therms to power-stations and 1,347 million therms to
commercial users.
The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters, water heaters and
refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic demand is for gas for
central heating. In 1975, 5,891 million therms were sold to domestic users, 9 per
cent more than in 1974.
I975_7^ the turnover of the British Gas Corporation and its subsidiary
companies amounted to ^1,566 million, of which sales of gas accounted for
j£i>34° million. After interest payments there was a profit of ^25*1 million.
Capital investment amounted to ^347 million. The borrowing limit for the
corporation has been fixed by the Gas Act 1972 at £2,500 million, to be
raised by order if necessary up to £2,700 million.
The British Gas Corporation has a research committee which advises on
research policy at four research stations which are each responsible for a
different area of work. Research is also done on behalf of the corporation at a
number of universities and colleges. The corporation’s total expenditure on
research and development and on technical service and testing amounted to
£i(i million in 1975-76.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were worked between 1858 and
1962. With the rapid growth of oil consumption during this century, however,
Britain has become almost totally dependent on imported supplies. With the
recent discoveries of oil in the British sector of the North Sea, Britain expects
to reduce or even eliminate this dependence.
The first discovery of oil in the British sector was made in 1969 and the first
oil from the British sector was brought ashore by tanker from the Argyll
field in June I975’ mid-1976 five fields in the British sector were producing
oil including the Forties field, one of the largest offshore oilfields in the world.
A further nine commercial fields have been discovered while several of the 43
other significant finds may prove to be commercial after further appraisal.
Production from most large fields is controlled from production platforms
of either steel or concrete which have been built to withstand severe weather
including winds of up to 130 mph (209 km/h) and waves of too feet (30
metres).
Production from the British sector amounted to i*i million tonnes in 1975
and is expected to rise rapidly during the rest of the 1970s. Latest government
estimates indicate a production rate in 1980 of between 95 million and 115
million tonnes a year from existing fields and allowing for further dis¬
coveries. Proven reserves of the commercial fields amount to 1,000 million
tonnes but possible reserves from present and future finds under existing
licences total 3,190 million tonnes. The total reserves of the designated
areas of the British Continental Shelf could amount to 4,500 million tonnes.

The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 provided for the establish¬
ment of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC); tighter controls over
exploration, development, installation of pipelines and refining capacity; and
control over the rate of depletion to ensure that offshore oil is used at a rate
which secures the greatest long-term benefit for Britain. The Government
considers that majority State participation in licences for commercial oilfields
provides the best means for the nation to share fully in the benefits of off¬
shore oil. Future licences will provide for majority State participation in
fields discovered. Discussions are in progress with the licensees of the
present commercial fields on the terms for majority State participation in
these fields; the first participation agreement was signed in February 1976.
Government revenue from petroleum operations on the British Continental
Shelf will be derived from a new petroleum revenue tax (see p. 356), corpora¬
tion tax, royalties and revenues accruing to the BNOC from participation.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment
by helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators
to identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and pro¬
moting new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry. British
companies increased their share of the offshore market, worth nearly ^1,200
million in 1975, from between 25 and 30 per cent in 1973 to 52 per cent in
I975- The industry thus developed can undertake construction work in the
world’s offshore market as investment in the British market levels off.
The British National Oil Corporation was set up as a public corporation on
1st January 1976. It took over the offshore interests of the National Coal
Board and will hold the Government’s participation interest in production
licences. It has powers to explore for, produce, transport and refine
petroleum; store, distribute and buy and sell petroleum; and provide advisory
services and carry out research and training. Other activities, which can be
undertaken only with the Government’s consent, include overseas explora¬
tion and production. Its borrowing limit is £600 million, which may be
increased to ^9°° million subject to approval by the House of Commons.
The BNOC s board consists of between eight and 20 members including two
civil servants appointed as official members.
Production of crude oil from land-based oilfields in Britain amounted to some
107,000 tonnes in 1975. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the
establishment of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Becking-
ham, Bothamsall and Egmanton), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough) and in
Dorset (Kimmeridge and Wareham).
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas. Production by these
companies amounts to about 7 per cent of world production and they operate
a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on charter) amounting to
over one-tenth of the world’s tanker tonnage.
I975 Britain s imports of crude oil were 85-8 million tons valued at
£3,371 million, the largest single item among imported goods. Saudi
Arabia supplied approximately 25 per cent by value, Iran 20 per cent,
Kuwait 12 per cent and Nigeria 7 per cent. Exports of crude oil from the
British sector of the Continental Shelf began in April 1976.

tonnes of motor spirit, 6’5 million tonnes of kerosene and 2*1 million tonnes
of bitumen.
Electricity generation accounted for 42 per cent of fuel oil consumption
in 1975. The largest industrial users of fuel oil are the steel, chemicals and
paper-making industries.
In 1976 gross refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 147 million tonnes a
year. Of the 22 refineries in operation, five have a capacity of under 1 million
tonnes. The 15 largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton (18-9 million
tonnes); Stanlow, in Cheshire (18-3 million tonnes); Isle of Grain (io-6
million tonnes), Shell Haven (10-2 million tonnes) and Coryton (8-6 million
tonnes), all three on the Thames Estuary; Teesport (5-8 million tonnes) and
North Tees (5 million tonnes), both in Cleveland; Grangemouth, Central
Scotland (8-5 million tonnes); three at Milford Haven (15-4 million tonnes,
5-2 million tonnes and 5 million tonnes) and one at Pembroke in Dyfed (9-4
million tonnes); Llandarcy near Swansea (8-i million tonnes); and two at
Killingholme near Grimsby (8-8 million tonnes and 4-4 million tonnes).
The other two refineries are at Belfast (1-5 million tonnes) and Ellesmere
Port, Cheshire (1-4 million tonnes). Proposals for further refineries are under
consideration at Cliffe (Kent), Canvey Island (Essex) and Nigg Bay (Highland).
Projects for the construction of refineries of over one million tons or the
extension of existing refineries by more than 500,000 tons require an authori¬
sation from the Secretary of State for Energy under the Petroleum and
Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975-
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) fell by
16 per cent in 1975 to 86'6 million tonnes. During 1975 refineries throughout
western Europe were refining below full capacity* There is a substantial
external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading and seasonal
requirements and the commercial arrangements of the major oil companies.
Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products to other
European countries, were valued at £683 million in 1975 an(^ imports
amounted to £719 million.
Four main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain from harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries: in central Scotland, from
Finnart to Grangemouth; in south Wales, from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to
Llandarcy; in north-west England, from Tranmere to Stanlow and Heysham;
and in the Humber area from a single buoy mooring in the Humber estuary
to Killingholme. A pipeline system connecting an offshore mooring off
Amlwch, Gwynedd, to Stanlow is to be commissioned in the second half of
1976. Submarine pipelines have been built to bring ashore oil from the
North Sea. Pipelines connect the Forties field to Cruden Bay (Grampian)
and the refinery at Grangemouth, the Piper field to a terminal at Flotta
(Orkney) and the Norwegian Ekofisk field to Teesside. Construction of two
submarine pipelines is in progress to link fields off the north-east coast of
Shetland to a terminal at Sullom Voe (see map, p. 260).
Pipelines also carry refined products to major marketing areas, for
example, from the Humber to the Manchester area, from Fawley to Staines,
Surrey, and Heathrow Airport, London, from Fawley to Avonmouth, and

from the Isle of Grain to Walton-on-Thames and Heathrow Airport. A
245-mile (394-kilometre) pipeline feeds refined products to north London
and the Midlands from refineries and installations on the Thames and
Mersey; a similar line 300 miles (480 kilometres) long from Milford Haven to
the Midlands and Manchester is in operation. Pipelines carrying petrochemical
feedstocks run from Stanlow to Carrington, near Manchester, and from
Teesside to Fleetwood, Lancashire, and Runcorn, Cheshire. The Pipelines
Act 1962 is designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned
industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(British Petroleum), Chester, and Woodstock in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon,
in Oxfordshire (Esso). Work in progress includes the evolution of new and
improved fuels and lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum
products and of new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at Godai¬
ming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has been a
feature of the industry. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were created as
a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a national scale through
voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity Board was set up to
construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting individual power
stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission. In 1943 the North of
Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was established as a public corpora¬
tion to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands. In 1948 all
municipal and private undertakings (other than those in Northern Ireland)
were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Elec¬
tricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where
they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two subsequent Acts (1954
and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its
present structure. Electricity supply employs about 193,000 people, including
6,900 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate area
electricity boards. Co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council, the
central body of the supply industry with a general responsibility for promoting
electricity supply and for advising the Secretary of State for Energy; it is also
responsible for a number of common services, principally capital financing,
research and industrial relations. The council consists of a chairman and
two deputy chairmen, the chairman and two designated members of the
CEGB, the chairmen of the 12 area electricity boards and not more than three
other members. The CEGB controls the operation and maintenance of
power stations and the main transmission system (the national grid) and
supplies electricity in bulk to the 12 area boards. The CEGB consists of a
chairman, a deputy chairman and between six and eight members. Each of
the 12 area electricity boards acquires bulk supplies of electricity from the
CEGB and is responsible for distribution networks and sales of electricity
to its area consumers. The Government is considering proposals for the
reorganisation of the industry in England and Wales.

separating their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh
on the Firth of Tay. Each board comprises a chairman and between four and
eight members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried
out by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service which came into operation
in 1973 as the result of the amalgamation of four former electricity under¬
takings. Power stations are located in Belfast, Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh.
In I975_7h the income of the electricity supply industry in England and
Wales was ^3>49h million and its profit after interest payments was ^8-5
million. In Scotland the income of the SSEB and the NSHEB was £291
million and j£io6 million respectively and their profits were ^2‘7 million and
^o-i million. In 1974-75 the Northern Ireland Electricity Service’s income
totalled ^69 million and it made a net loss of ^28‘7 million. Annual capital
investment amounts to ^640 million in England and Wales, £140 million in
Scotland and ^68 million in Northern Ireland. The statutory limit to
borrowings by the industryinEnglandand Wales is ^6,500 million, in Northern
Ireland £650 million and in Scotland £1,200 million; the Government pro¬
poses to raise the limit in Scotland to .£1,500 million, with provision for a
further increase up to £1,950 million.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached 251,300 gigawatt hours1
(GWh) in 1975; conventional steam power stations provided 88 per cent of
the total and nuclear and hydro-electric stations about 10 per cent and 2 per
cent respectively. A high rate of expansion of output was a feature of the
industry in its earliest years, but the rate has slackened recently and the total
of electricity generated in 1975 was about the same as in 1974. Consequently
a number of old power stations, mainly small coal-fired plant no longer
required to generate electricity, have been, or are due to be, closed; the
CEGB is to close 48 small power stations or parts of stations between October
1976 and March 1977. Forecasts of future demand for electricity have been
reduced and as a result the CEGB will not need to order conventional
stations before 1978- Public supply power stations in Britain consumed 109
million tons of coal equivalent in 1975, of which coal accounted for 67 per cent
and oil 19 per cent.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Britain at the end of 1975 totalled 68,555 megawatts (MW). Between 1970
and 1975 over 17,400 MW of output capacity was commissioned in England
and Wales, including 681 MW in I975> bringing total output capacity to
59,011 MW. The SSEB’s total output capacity is over 6,000 MW and the
NSHEB’s total installed capacity is about 2,150 MW. In Northern Ireland
total generating capacity was 1,905 MW in 1975 of which some 1,425 MW
was installed in oil-fired stations and the remainder in coal-fired stations.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small—
20,878 GWh in 1975. The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants controlled by Atomic Energy Authority or by British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd.
An analysis of electricity generation by the public supply system in Great
Britain is given in Table 20.

Average thermal efficiency (that is, the ratio of the electrical energy output
to the heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations
in England and Wales rose from 2075 per cent in 1947 to 31-26 per cent
in 1975-76 as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations,
containing much of the newest plant, had an average thermal efficiency of
33-72 per cent in 1975-76.

Oil-fired stations of 2,000 MW have been commissioned at Fawley, on
Southampton Water (one of the most fully automated stations in Europe),
and at Pembroke, Dyfed. Oil-fired stations under construction are at Grain,
Kent (3,300 MW), Inverkip, Strathclyde (1,980 MW), Littlebrook D, Kent
(1,980 MW), Kilroot, near Carrickfergus (1,200 MW) and Ince B, Cheshire
(1,000 MW).
Europe’s largest dual-fired station designed to burn either coal or oil is at
Kingsnorth, Kent (2,000 MW). The station at Peterhead, Grampian (1,320
MW), due to be commissioned in 1978, will be able to burn natural gas and
liquids as well as oil. Two stations involving some 1,600 MW of plant have
been converted to dual natural gas/coal-firing.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
The installation of 49 single-shaft units of 500 MW in 14 stations has been
substantially completed. Station capacities are also increasing: a 2,400 MW
station at Longannet, Fife, with four 600 MW cross-compound units, was
commissioned in 1970; and ten stations each with capacities of 2,000 MW,
with four 500 MW single-shaft generating units, are now in service. Three
660 MW single-shaft generating units have been commissioned at Drax,
North Yorkshire, and 660 MW units have been connected to the national grid
at two nuclear power stations (see p. 267). A further 19 660 MW units are being
installed: five at Grain, three each at Littlebrook and Inverkip, two at Peter¬
head and two each at three nuclear power stations under construction (for
locations see map, p. 264).
Large gas turbine units of 55 to 70 MW, based on aero jet engines, have
been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and SSEB
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Nuclear Power

have installed 916 MW of such units. IVfany others of 17 to 315 M!W capacity
are being used in new stations to safeguard auxiliary supplies to the large
new steam units and also to provide capacity for peak operation. Two 58 MW
prototype units at Leicester are powered by industrial gas turbines.
In 1975 nuclear power stations provided some 30,000 GWh of electricity
for the public supply system, mostly from stations Owned and operated by
the electricity authorities. Britain has so far produced some 25 per cent of
total world generation (excluding the Soviet Union) from nuclear sources.
Nuclear capacity forms about 9 per cent of total output capacity of the public
supply system. Commercial nuclear power stations have lower operating
costs than conventional stations.
There are 11 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the elec¬
tricity authorities, while a further five stations are controlled by the Atomic
Energy Authority (AEA) or British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (BNFL). The
original prototype magnox stations (graphite-moderated, carbon-dioxide
cooled, using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in magnesium
alloy), built by the AEA at Calder Hall, Cumbria (198 MW)—the first in the
world to generate electricity on a commercial scale—and at Chapelcross,
Dumfries and Galloway (198 MW), are owned and operated by BNFL,
which was set up in 1971 an<^ took over from the AEA the manufacture and
processing of nuclear fuels for Britain and other countries. The AEA has
three experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity into the
national grid: the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale,
Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR)
at Winfrith, Dorset (100 MW); and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PER)
(250 MW) at Dounreay, Highland.
Under the first commercial programme, nine magnox stations with a total
design capacity of 4,800 MW were built: Berkeley in Gloucestershire (276 MW
design capacity) and Bradwell in Essex (300 MW) were both commissioned in
1962; Hunterston A in Strathclyde (300 MW) in 1964; Hinkley Point A
in Somerset, Trawsfynydd in Gwynedd (both 500 MW) and Dungeness A in
Kent (550 MW) in 1965; Sizewell A in Suffolk (580 MW) in 1966; Oldbury in
Avon (600 MW) in 1968; and Wylfa in Gwynedd (1,180 MW) in 1971.
Under a second programme a further five stations are expected to be
commissioned by 1979 an(^ will provide nearly 6,500 MW of further capacity.
The reactor design chosen for the programme is based on the AGR at
Windscale, a logical development of the magnox system, which uses slightly
enriched uranium dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel. The first two AGR
stations at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B (both 1,320 MW) began supply¬
ing power to the national grid in February 1976. Other AGR stations under
construction are Dungeness B (1,200 MW); and Hartlepool (Cleveland) and
Heysham (Lancashire) (both 1,320 MW).
A third programme using the SGHWR, which runs on uranium dioxide fuel
in zirconium alloy cans, was announced in 1974. In the initial phase a further
4,000 MW of nuclear capacity, based on reactor units of 660 MW, is planned.
This will comprise two SGHWR stations—Sizewell B with four reactor
units and Torness (Lothian) with two. It is intended to build up orders for
further nuclear plant, depending on the progress achieved with the initial
stations. The SGHWR commercial power stations are to be designed and
constructed for the boards by the Nuclear Power Company Limited, the
operating subsidiary of the National Nuclear Corporation, set up in 1973
with government encouragement to design and construct steam supply

systems for nuclear power stations. Commissioning of the AEA’s large
PFR (see p. 267) took place during 1975 at Dounreay (where in 1962 the
experimental fast reactor became the first of its type to produce electricity
for public use and to operate at a high power level). The fast breeder reactor,
which uses as fuel a mixture of plutonium and uranium dioxides in stainless
steel cans, is capable of releasing some 60 times as much energy from
uranium as present nuclear power stations.
Hydro-electric generation is confined almost entirely to Scotland and W ales.
Most of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with
their own natural catchment areas. The setting up of the NSHEB in 1943
marked the beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the
Highlands.
In 1975-76, 2,730 GWh were sent out by the NSHEB from water-power,
compared with 322 GWh in I949- end of March 197^ there were 54
main hydro-electric conventional stations in operation in the north of Scotland
with a total installed capacity of 1,046 MW; the largest station, Loch Sloy,
has a capacity of 130 MW. Capacity of hydro-electric stations in the south
of Scotland totals 123 MW and in Wales 470 MW, including the 360 MW
pumped-storage station at Ffestiniog, Gwynedd. (In pumped-storage
schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to
higher levels from which it descends to operate turbo-generators at peak
periods, or to meet sudden increases in demand.) Other important pumped-
storage schemes are at Cruachan, Strathclyde (40° MW), and Foyers, Loch
Ness (300 MW). Work has started on a 1,500 MW pumped-storage station
at Dinorwic, Gwynedd, which will be able to reach its full load very rapidly
and consequently will result in a reduction in part-loading of thermal plant.
The contract for the main underground works and the lower lake is one of the
largest civil engineering contracts awarded in Britain.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1976 those of the CEGB totalled 13,820 circuit kilo¬
metres (8,587 miles), of which 10,682 circuit kilometres (6,637 miles) were at
400,000 volts, and the remainder at 275,000 volts. Primary distribution in
England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary distribution at 33,000 volts,
tertiary at 11,000 volts or below and general low voltage distribution at 240
volts single phase. In Scotland there were 8,385 circuit kilometres (5,210
miles) of main transmission lines at the end of March 1976, of which 200 kilo¬
metres (124 miles) operated at 400,000 volts, 3,144 circuit kilometres (1,954
miles) at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary distribution
in Scotland is at 33,000 volts. Energy movements on the grid in England and
Wales are controlled through the seven grid control areas, set up for that
purpose and distinct from the regions in which the generating side of the in¬
dustry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations are
co-ordinated by a National Control in London. rl he grid in Scotland is oper¬
ated from the control centres at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch
(SSEB).
The development of the grid system has made the British system the
largest fully interconnected power network under unified control in the world.
Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been in
operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.

Total sales of electricity in 1975 amounted to 217,800 GWh. Domestic
users took 41 per cent of the total, industry 38 per cent and commercial and
other users about 21 per cent. About one-third of domestic sales is for space
heating, one-quarter for water heating and one-tenth for cooking. Electricity
is used in industry almost entirely for motive power, melting, heating and
lighting.
The electricity industry supplies about 22 million consumers of whom ig'$
million are in England and Wales; of the remainder 1-5 million are supplied by
the SSEB, 498,000 by the NSHEB and 500,000 by the Northern Ireland
Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research
comprising direct research carried out by the electricity boards supported
by co-operative research with selected industrial research associations and
by research contracts placed with universities and other organisations. The
council is also empowered to conduct research and is advised by the Electricity
Supply Research Council. Collaboration on research between the supply
industry and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineer¬
ing Research Steering Committee.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the CEGB and
comprise the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead,
Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Gloucestershire, concerned with nuclear
problems, and the Engineering Laboratories at Marchwood, on Southampton
Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity utilisation is under¬
taken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire,
and by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
on their own and in co-operation with other electricity authorities. They
undertake a wide range of research and development work, both independently
and in conjunction with the universities and manufacturers and are associated
with the activities of the Electricity Council and CEGB.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials are met mostly
by imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make a useful contribution
to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1975 totalled 327 million
tonnes, valued at £580 million, about the same tonnage as in 1970 but twice the
value. The total number of employees in the industry was 44,400 in 1975. The
geographical locations of some of the more important minerals produced in
Britain are shown on the maps on p. 271.
Under the Mineral Exploration and Investment Grants Act 1972 the Secre¬
tary of State for Industry can encourage exploration for mineral resources by
providing financial assistance of up to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for
mineral deposits in Great Britain and on Britain’s Continental Shelf, and
evaluating them for commercial purposes. Minerals included in the scheme
are the ores of non-ferrous metals, fluorspar, barium minerals and potash. By
the end of March 1976, 39 companies had sought assistance totalling £i'5
million in respect of 118 exploration projects, mainly for non-ferrous metals.
Work on 77 projects has been completed.

Environment Research Council, is carrying out on behalf of the Department
of Industry a five-year programme costing £3-9 million, aimed at providing
basic geological information on five identified areas which may yield economic
deposits of minerals and has an annual £800,000 programme for the Depart¬
ment of the Environment to assess resources of sand and gravel, and limestone.
Production of non-ferrous ores in 1975 totalled 28,700 tonnes, valued at
£21 million. Tin was first worked in Cornwall over 2,000 years ago. In the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Britain was a leading world producer of
copper, lead and tin, but subsequently overseas competition led to the
closure of many mines and falling production. Changing world markets have
brought some recovery in production; output of tin has more than trebled
since 1970 to reach 4,100 tonnes of tin-in-ore in i975> supplying 30 per
cent of Britain’s tin requirements. Some copper, zinc, tungsten and silver
are produced in association with the tin. Production of lead ore has remained
fairly constant over the past few years in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes
of dressed ore a year. Production of iron ore (4’5 niillion tonnes in 1975)
fallen substantially in recent years.
Britain is a major world producer of several important industrial minerals
including china clay, ball clay, fuller’s earth, salt, fluorspar, gypsum,
anhydrite and celestite, and also produces significant amounts of limestone,
dolomite, chalk, industrial sands and fireclay, mostly for consumption in
Britain. China clay is used mainly as a filler and coater for fine-quality paper,
for making high-quality pottery and also in the paint, rubber, plastics,
insecticide and fertiliser industries. Most of the output of china clay and
ball clay is exported. Fuller’s earth is used in refining, as a bonding agent in
foundry moulding sands, for oil-well drilling muds and in various civil
engineering applications. Fireclay is used for ceramic ware and refractory
products.
Britain is virtually self-sufficient in salt, output in 1975 being 7-6 million
tonnes valued at £25 million. In 1975 production of fluorspar for the chemical
and metallurgical industries was 231,000 tonnes valued at £8 million and
of gypsum and anhydrite for the chemicals and construction industries was
3‘5 million tonnes worth £9 million. Output of potash from the new mine
at Boulby, Cleveland, is expected to rise in 1976 to its initial annual capacity
of 1 million tonnes, exceeding domestic consumption, about 95 per cent of
which is accounted for by fertiliser manufacturers.
In 1975 production of limestone and dolomite totalled 93 million tonnes,
valued at £147 million, of which about 25 per cent was used in industry,
particularly in the iron and steel, chemicals and glassmaking industries.
Chalk production in 1975 amounted to 17 million tonnes worth £13 million, of
which some 16 million tonnes were used in industry or agriculture, mostly for
cement manufacture. Industrial sands are used primarily in the glassmaking
and foundry industries; output in 1975 was 6 million tonnes.
Britain also produces small amounts of barytes, talc, diatomite and
mineral pigments.
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock as aggregates for use in construc¬
tion constituted over half of Britain’s output of minerals in 1975. Sand and
gravel, used for concrete, is the most important of these minerals and the
largest user of land. Of the total output of 119 million tonnes of common
sand and gravel in 1975, worth £150 million, 14-5 million tonnes were

marine-dredged and Britain is the world’s largest producer of marine-
dredged aggregates. Production of limestone for aggregates was 67 million
tonnes in 1975- Output of sandstone in 1975 was 9 tonnes \alued at
£23 million and of igneous rock 36 million tonnes valued at million.
Small amounts of limestone, sandstone, igneous rock and slate are used as
building stone and architectural facing material.
Production of limestone, chalk and clay as raw materials for cement
manufacture was 10 million, 14 million and 4 million tonnes respectively in
1975. Some 17 million tonnes of clay and shale were produced for the manu¬
facture of bricks, pipes and tiles.
WATER SERVICES
Since 1974 the various water services in Britain have undergone a massive
reorganisation, brought about by the Water Act 1973 and form a national
industry with a capital expenditure falling halfway between those of the
electricity and gas industries. The new arrangements recognise the increasing
interdependence of all parts of the hydrological cycle by bringing all aspects
of water services within any river basin or catchment area under one manage¬
ment, thus ensuring a more effective use of available resources. Such services
include water conservation and supply, sewerage and sewage disposal, water
pollution control (see p. i75)> drainage and flood protection, amenity
and recreation, fisheries and in some cases inland navigation (see p. 310). The
broad concept applies throughout Great Britain though arrangements vary
in different parts.
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, normally
sufficient for domestic and industrial requirements. Supplies are obtained
partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in
upland gathering grounds and river intakes, and partly from underground
sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes.
To deal with potentially acute water shortages in some areas as a result of a
period of the driest weather for some 250 years the Government in 1976 took
special measures. These included the passing of the Drought Act 1976
powers, to water authorities to restrict non-essential uses of water and, if
necessary, ration supplies; and the appointment of one of the Ministers of
State at the Department of the Environment to be responsible for co-ordinating
action relating to the drought (see p. 48). A campaign was at the same time
launched to achieve voluntary savings of water by the general public.
The householder receives his domestic water supply at a comparatively
small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of a
water rate levied, like other rates, on the net annual value of his house. Indus¬
trial users are charged in most cases according to actual metered consumption.
England and Responsibility for promoting a national policy for water in England and
Wales Wales rests with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food who, under the Water
Act 1973, are charged with responsibility for securing the conservation,
augmentation, distribution and proper use of water resources and the provi¬
sion of water supplies; the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services;
the restoration and maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other
inland waters; the use of inland waters for navigation and recreation; the
provision of land drainage; and the protection and development of fisheries.

Among bodies set up under the Act is the National Water Council to advise
and assist ministers and water authorities. The council consists of a chairman
appointed by the Secretaries of State, the chairmen of the water authorities,
and ten other members with special relevant knpwledge, of whom eight have
been appointed by the Secretaries of State and two by the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh National Water
Development Authority in Wales were set up under the Act and duties relating
to water management in their areas were transferred to them. The board of each
water authority consists of a chairman and several members appointed by the
Secretary of State for the Environment, a few members appointed by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a small majority, usually of
onlyone, of members appointed by the county and district councils within the
area of the authority. District councils usually also act as agents of water
authorities for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of public
sewers in their areas.
The Act provides for the continued supply of water by 28 statutory water
companies for the water authorities. It makes special arrangements governing
the relationship of statutory water companies to the water authorities and
for control of the latter over them.
An independent Central Water Planning Unit provides a professional water
planning capability at national level. Its principal functions are to keep
under review national and strategic aspects of water services planning and
operation.
The Water Data Unit, part of the Directorate General Water Engineering
of the Department of the Environment, has as its principal functions to
advise on information required for water management purposes, to ensure
common standards and methods of data collection and to publish such data
on a national basis.
A Water Space Amenity commission has also been established to advise the
Secretary of State for the Environment, the National Water Council and the
water authorities on the discharge of their functions relating to recreational
and amenity use of water space in England. The commission consists of a
chairman appointed by the Secretary of State, the chairmen of the water
authorities and not more than ten other members appointed by the Secretary
of State—one in consultation with the Countryside Commission. All regional
water authorities are pursuing active policies for the support and development
of fishing and other water sport and amenity interests in their regions,
particularly on the reservoirs already in their possession or in process of
being built.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 99 per cent of
the total population—now total some 3,300 million gallons (15 million cubic
metres) a day, out of a total estimated abstraction of nearly 5,300 million
gallons (24 million cubic metres) a day (excluding water used for cooling
in connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure in 1975-76 on
Water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £502 million (at
1975 prices).
274 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By
March 1976 schemes costing over £125 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts, totalling ^3^ million.
New Proposals The Government published a consultative document in March 1976 proposing
a strong National Water Authority which would amalgamate the National
Water Council, the Water Research Centre and the Central Water Planning
Unit and bring about the eventual integration of the statutory water companies
with the regional water authority; it is also intended that responsibility for
water services in Wales be devolved to the Welsh Assembly.
Scotland In Scotland, as part of the reorganisation of local government under the
Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, nine regional and three island
councils took over in May 1975 from the former thirteen regional water
boards responsibility for public water supply under the Water (Scotland)
Act 1946.
Except in the island areas, separate river purification boards are responsible
for the regulation of the discharges of effluent to rivers and certain tidal
waters. The Central Scotland Water Development Board, established under
the Water (Scotland) Act 1967, is primarily responsible for developing large
water resources and supplying water in bulk to regional councils in Central
Scotland from which the Board draws its membership.
The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England and
Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between com¬
peting interests and requirements are met almost entirely from surface
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for general over¬
sight and co-ordination and has a general duty to promote the conservation of
water resources in Scotland; and to require regional and island councils to
provide supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their regions or areas
where this can be done at reasonable cost; at present, they supply over 98
per cent of the total population. A survey of currently available supplies
and likely demands to the end of the present century and of potential services
to be developed was carried out by the Scottish Development Department in
consultation with the water boards (see Bibliography, p. 465). The Scottish
Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of State on general questions
relating to resources and supplies and the organisation of the water service.
Northern Ireland has abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial consumption. Over 90 per cent of the population has a piped
supply. Between 1945 and end-September 1973 over £100 million was
expended on water and sewerage services—about £50 million by way of
government grants. The Government, responsible for water conservation
and pollution control under the Water Act (NI) 1972, took over from local
authorities, on xst October 1973, responsibility for water supply and sewerage
services. The Water and Sewerage Services (NI) Order 1973 requires the
Department of the Environment (NI) to provide these services. Capital
expenditure during 1975 amounted to around £17-5 million.
The largest source for water supply is Lough Neagh and in order to
conserve the potential and to co-ordinate the various interests and demands
on this water resource system a comprehensive water management programme
has been prepared.

Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake
of fresh water, and studies have been carried out for several estuaries in
Britain. A report on a study for Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, published early
in 1972, put forward several suggested schemes, including a barrage and
storage reservoirs. Reports have also been prepared for plans for the Wash and
the estuary of the Dee. A feasibility study for the River Parrett, Somerset,
barrage scheme, completed in January 1975, adds land drainage, flood pre¬
vention, recreational amenity and road linkage to the water storage objective.
A Water Research Centre which started operating in April 1974 co-ordinates
water research in the whole of Britain (see p. 394). The Water Research
Centre’s station at Medmenham and the Hydraulics Research Station of the
Department of the Environment at Wallingford carry out research into
problems of the design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the
measurement of surface water, and into other hydraulic problems.
The Water Research Centre’s Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted water, the treatment and
disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention
of pollution of surface water and underground water.
The Institute of Hydrology of the Natural Environment Research Council
at Wallingford studies the whole hydrological cycle and the Meteorological
Office (see p. 398) is concerned with rain fall.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its most
important industries. It occupies 657,000 people or 27 per cent of the total
civilian working population, provides about 27 per cent of the gross domestic
product, and uses 19 million of the 24 million hectares (47 million of the 60
million acres) of land.
THE LAND AND The soils of the country are varied (see p. 5). Land used for farming is con-
ITS USES ventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In Britain there are 12-1 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and
grass. Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland (ancillary to farming) and
other land on agricultural holdings together represent 79 per cent of the land
area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The
area available for farming is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing
and industry; so far, the loss has been offset by the increase in output from
what remains.1 The ratio of rough grazing—used for livestock, mainly sheep
to better-quality agricultural land varies considerably throughout Britain. In
the southern half of England, for example, rough grazing constitutes only
about one-sixth of the total area, increasing to one-fifth in Northern Ireland,
about a third in the hill regions of England and Wales and nearly three-
quarters in Scotland.
Size of Farms There are about 272,000 statistically significant farming units in Britain. Some
42 per cent are very small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for
less than 4 per cent of the industry’s total output. Of the 170,000 full-time farm
businesses some 39,500 are classified (by standard man-days) as large farm
businesses (capable of employing four or more men full-time): these, account¬
ing for some 15 per cent of the number of holdings, produce more than half
of the industry’s total output. There are about 53,000 medium-sized (two-
three men) and some 64,500 small farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been
encouraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings
is 105 hectares (259 acres) of crops and grass (including rough grazings).
1 The year IQ75-76 was an exception; it is estimated that net product at constant
prices fell, owing to particularly unfavourable weather which had its biggest effect
on arable production. Full effects of the 1976 drought on the 1976-77 output are not
known yet.

Production
Some 34,000 of the total of significant farming units are in Northern
Ireland: over half of these provide a full-time occupation for the owner and
produce over four-fifths of the total output. The average farm size is 23
hectares (57 acres). Other holdings, of which there are about 16,000, are
either extremely small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing).
The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full¬
time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep.
One in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or
horticulture or are mixed farms. In England the farms devoted primarily to
arable crops are in the eastern part of the country—in East Anglia, Kent,
Lincolnshire and Humberside. In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast
are also primarily arable. Potatoes and vegetables are grown mainly in the
Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the
rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early
potatoes are an important crop in Dyfed and the south-west. Elsewhere,
horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly on better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 40 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 35 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder are either specialised cropping and horticultural
holdings, intensive pig and poultry units or mixed farms with no predominant
single enterprise. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock
feeding, and the only important cash crop is potatoes.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp. 285-87.
The steady expansion in production and in yield per hectare of arable land
which has taken place since 1936 despite falling manpower is summarised in
Table 21, which also shows the effect of the exceptionally unfavourable weather
during 1975. Apart from slight falls between 1961 and 1964, in 1968 and 1975,
total cattle stocks have risen each year since 1957, to reach a record of 15‘2
million in 1974. Over the past decade the beef herd has grown considerably,
but expansion in the milk-producing herd has been less marked. Numbers
of sheep and lambs reached their highest level in 1966; although they later
declined, they expanded steadily from 1972 to 1974; there was a slight drop
in 1975. Numbers of pigs and poultry increased considerably during the
decade to 1974 but fell in 1975. Arable production has shown a greater
diversification since the second world war. Total cereals production has
increased greatly since i960, reaching over 16 million tonnes in 1974-75; it
fell to under 14 million tonnes in 1975-76. Potato production is susceptible
to weather conditions but, on average, adequate supplies are maintained from
a steadily-declining area. Between 1963 and 1973-74 output of pigmeat
increased by one-quarter and eggs by one-tenth; these increases, together

with those in beef and milk, resulted in higher consumption of feedingstuffs,
mostly from home resources. (Output of both pigmeat and eggs fell in 1974-75
and 1975-76.) Between four million and five million tonnes of concentrated
feeds are imported each year, depending on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product (all holdings) at constant prices rose
steadily until 1974-75. By 1953-54 it was some 56 per cent above the immediate
pre-war average; it rose a further 36 per cent between 1954-57 and 1964-67.
With the average of 1968-72 as a base, the index for all commercially signi¬
ficant holdings reached 119 in 1974-75. A fall to 102 is forecast for the excep¬
tionally unfavourable year 1975-76.
Grassland The British climate suits grassland farming. Grassland forms an important
section of the economy of most farms, whether as permanent grass, mostly
occupying land less suitable for cultivation, or as sown grassland (leys), often
part of the arable rotation. A wide range of herbage species and varieties are
used, over half of the total supply of herbage seed being produced in Britain.
Grassland production has been enhanced over recent years by the develop¬
ment and application of new techniques, notably the increased use of fertilisers
(especially nitrogenous), new methods of grazing control, improved herbage
conservation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough grazings remain as semi¬
natural grassland used for extensively grazed flocks and herds, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.
Crops Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About 4-4 million
tonnes were harvested in 1975 with average yields estimated at 4-29 tonnes
Cereals per hectare (171 tons per acre). About one-half of the wheat crop is used for
flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since i960 the area under barley has increased by over 58 per cent and in
general production has risen faster because yields have also increased. The
malting and distilling market currently absorbs about one-fifth of the crop;
most of the remainder is retained by farms or sold for animal feed.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
Fodder Crops The total area of fodder crops has fallen because in many cases farmers can
provide winter feed more economically by increased grass production and
improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops are turnips,
swedes and kale in England and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Sugar Beet Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire under contract to the
British Sugar Corporation Ltd. (the sole British processor) which also provides
technical advice and assistance. The corporation contracts annually for the
area from which it will buy beet; the contracted area has risen over the last
few years to 206,000 hectares (510,000 acres) in 1976. At normal yields this
should produce about one million tonnes of sugar—about two-fifths of total
British consumption. (The balance is largely supplied, under the Lome
Convention (see p. 375) By developing countries which export raw cane
sugar.)
Potatoes Potatoes are grown in most parts of Britain. First supplies of early potatoes
normally come at the end of May, and the lifting of maincrop varieties usually
starts in September. Seed potato production for Britain and for export is
chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
. Britain is normally self-sufficient in maincrop potatoes. As yields are
increasing, requirements, including the demand for processed potatoes, can
usually be met from a declining acreage.
The total area planted with potatoes in 1975 was 204,000 hectares (504,000
acres) and the average yield per hectare was 22-1 tonnes, about 9-5 tonnes
less than in 1974, owing to the adverse weather conditions. This resulted in
total supply (including imports) being well below normal. Although potato
production is becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour is still
needed.
In England, Scotland and Wales more milk goes for liquid consumption
than for manufacture, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk is
used for manufactured products. Average consumption of liquid milk per
head is 275 litres (about 475 pints) a week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about
13 per cent and now average some 4,100 litres (900 gallons) a year. Freedom
from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate
brucellosis is well advanced. The Friesian breed is dominant in the dairy herds
of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Ayrshire breed in Scotland.
Average herd size is 40 cows. Milk production has been stimulated by advances
in grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of
making high quality hay and silage. Most dairy farmers practise some degree
of intensive grass management, but hay or silage of the traditional type supple¬
mented with purchased concentrates remain the basic winter feeds.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks.
British breeds have recently been joined by a number of continental breeds.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
two-thirds of the dairy herd in England, Scotland and \\ ales being bred in
this way, through centres operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other
organisations.
In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Gallo¬
way and Welsh Black breeds and their crosses; in marginal land and lower
areas the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford
breeds. About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the dairy
herds, some females being mated to beef sires. There is a large and complex
trade in store cattle (increased by animals imported from the Irish Republic),
a typical movement being from the upland west to grazing areas in the Mid¬
lands. The demand for lean tender beef at an economic price has stimulated
the development of intensive and semi-intensive systems of production.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production. More than 40 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a particular area. Research has provided vaccine and sera protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages; first, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more rapidly
maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on to the milder lowland

conditions, where they become crossed again with Down rams for fat lamb
production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the lowland sires fecundity
and early maturity. Fat lamb production provides the main source of income
for sheep farmers but wool is also of considerable importance, especially to
farmers in hill areas.
Pigs Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger
herds. The most frequently used breeds are the Large White and the Landrace
though a large number of cross-bred sows are also used in commercial pig-
meat production. Artificial insemination is available nationally.
About 25 per cent of the pigmeat is used for bacon and 75 per cent for
pork and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.
Poultry The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in
intensive production units and by genetic improvements in stock. Only a small
proportion of total production is in the hands of the smaller producers—some
three-quarters of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more while
about three-quarters of the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The
average yield of eggs per bird is about 230 a year. About 248 million broilers
and other special table chickens were slaughtered in 1975. Nearly all eggs and
poultry meat consumed in Britain are home produced.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are worth nearly 11 per cent of the total value of agri¬
cultural output—an estimated £539 million in 1975-76 out of a total of
^5,054 million.
At the June 1975 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 285,000 hectares (705,000 acres), about 2-4 per cent of the land used
for crops and grass. Fruit accounted for about 70,000 hectares (173,000
acres), vegetables, excluding potatoes, for about 198,000 hectares (490,000
acres) and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for about 15,000 hectares (37,000
acres). Crops under glass, plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms,
occupied about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings where soil,
climate, skilled labour and irrigation can produce maximum yields of high-
quality crops and where access to markets or good roads enable them to be
sold at economic prices. Most horticultural enterprises are increasing output
per unit area with the help of improved planting material, new techniques of
cultivation and environmental control and the widespread use of machinery.
Some horticultural crops form parts of general farm rotations but the returns
from increased specialisation favour separate horticultural enterprises within
the general farm.
Fruit Of the land used for fruit growing in 1975 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) were
devoted to soft fruit and the remainder was under orchards. The area of
apple orchards (excluding cider apples) is some 35,000 hectares (86,000
acres). Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop, the main production
areas being Kent and neighbouring counties, in the south-east, the southern
part of East Anglia, and Hereford and Worcester. Recent plantings are largely
of Cox’s Orange Pippin which is marketed throughout autumn and winter;

more of the new orchards consist of closely planted dwarf trees which can be
efficiently pruned, sprayed and picked. England and Northern Ireland are
among the few countries which grow varieties of apples especially suitable
for cooking, the best-known of which is Bramley s Seedling. There are about
5,000 hectares (12,350 acres) in the West Midlands and the south-west of
England devoted to cider apple production.
Although pears thrive best in the warmer continental climate, in the east
and south-east of England where somewhat similar conditions prevail the
Conference pear and a few other high-quality varieties are produced. Cherries
and plums are grown in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and
parts of East Anglia. Around Perth in Scotland is the largest concentration of
raspberry plantations in the world. This forms the basis of an important
processing industry.
Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, accounting for some
6,900 hectares (17,000 acres); they are produced mainly in Kent and East
Anglia. Blackcurrants are also widely grown in Britain, mainly for the prepara¬
tion of juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for confectionery.
Other fruits include gooseberries, red and white currants, loganberries and
blackberries. Almost all the nuts consumed in Britain are imported but a few
cob nuts and filberts are still grown in parts of Kent.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants. There are now, in many
parts of the country, units with automatic control of heating, ventilation, and
semi-automatic control of watering coupled with carbon-dioxide enrichment
of the atmosphere. Tomatoes form the most important glasshouse crop, either
as a single crop or in rotation with others, and together with lettuce and cu¬
cumbers represent some 95 per cent of the total value of glasshouse vegetable
output. There is also increasing production of a range of crops not traditionally
grown under glass and the areas under sweet peppers and celery have increased
significantly. Cucumbers are extensively grown in the traditional glasshouse
area in the Lee Valley to the north of London and more recently in Yorkshire.
Mushrooms, whose farmgate value is forecast at over £26 million for i975_7^>
are grown in specially constructed sheds in numerous parts of the country. Pro¬
duction in Northern Ireland, in particular, is steadily increasing each year.
Bulbs occupied some 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) and hardy nursery stock
some 7,300 hectares (18,000 acres) in June 1975 ; flowers in the open took
about 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres). Many nurseries concentrate on the pro¬
duction of plants in containers for sale through the garden centres which
have been established on the outskirts of many towns.
The production of dry bulbs for sale and bulb flowers for market takes
place particularly in the Holland area of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, the east of
Scotland, Cornwall, and in the Isles of Scilly where more than 50 per cent of
the cultivable land is devoted to bulbs which flower from November to May.
Vegetables and outdoor salad crops are grown in the traditional areas of the
Thames Valley, north Kent, Vale of Evesham, south Lancashire and Hum¬
berside, but newer areas, especially suited through soil type or climate to
production of a particular crop, have come into prominence. West Cornwall,
south Devon, Dyfed and Kent send winter cauliflowers and spring cabbage
to most urban markets while almost half the summer and autumn cauliflowers
come from Lincolnshire. The light soils of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire are

especially suitable for carrots and onions, and the Holland area of Lincolnshire
accounts for just over a quarter of the onion acreage. Brussels sprouts are
grown extensively in Bedfordshire, the Vale of Evesham, and well up the
east coast of England wherever freezing factories are sited for the processing
of fish as well as vegetables. Peas and dwarf beans are increasingly sold frozen,
canned or dried and so are grown close to factories in the east of England and
in Scotland. Celery is mainly grown on the moss soils of south-east Lancashire,
the peats of Norfolk and the fens of Cambridgeshire. Nearly three-quarters
of the early rhubarb is produced in Humberside where plants grown in the
open are then forced in unlit sheds.
Hops for the brewing industry are grown in Kent, East Sussex, Hampshire,
and Hereford and Worcester. They occupy only about 6,500 hectares (16,000
acres) but have a very high yield per hectare and value by weight.
Britain now produces just over half of its total food requirements or nearly
70 per cent of those supplies that can be produced in temperate climates.
Home production of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight
of total supplies in Table 22.

Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The aggregate net income of farmers (unadjusted for inflation) rose from £455
million in 1965-66 to an estimated £1,357 million in 1975-76. The figures
given in Table 23 show that Britain’s farming is predominantly based on live¬
stock enterprises. Nearly seven-tenths of total farm output is in the form of
livestock or livestock products.
Of all farm expenses, purchased feedingstuffs amount to more than a
quarter, wages to nearly one-fifth and machinery (including depreciation) to
over one-fifth. Since i960 male agricultural earnings have increased four¬
fold (by about half in real terms), offsetting the manpower economies made
possible by mechanisation and larger farms, while labour productivity has
risen by about 4-5 per cent a year since 1964-65.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.

It is estimated that ^239 million was added to the value of buildings and
works and ^415 million was invested in new plant, machinery and vehicles
in 1975. The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is provided
by the occupiers. Bank advances are an important source of outside capital,
both fixed and working; about two-thirds of the total bank advances to agri¬
culture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural merchants
are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans form the
chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised financial
institutions (see p. 287) and private sources.
Accounts of some 2,000 farms in England and Wales, collected by agri¬
cultural economists in 1975, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital
ranging from about £^0 per hectare (^12 per acre) on hill farms with extensive
rough grazings to over £300 per hectare (£120 per acre) on some lowland
farms. On all types of farm investment in machinery is a heavy item: on dairy
and arable farms it averages about £&o per hectare (£32 per acre); on stock¬
rearing farms it may amount to £30 per hectare {£12 per acre).
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 530,000
tractors in 1975 or one to every 13 hectares (32 acres) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 66,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1975- A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply and

accompanying equipment. There are about 1,700 farmers’ machinery syndi¬
cates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment without
tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide; incomes vary
with the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the
occupier. The average net income for farms in England and Wales of different
types is generally within the range of £30 to £110 per hectare (£12 to £45 per
acre) with the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings,
which are more intensive in their use of land. Net income per hectare on dairy
and arable farms has nearly always been higher than on stock-rearing farms,
which are generally greater in area than the other types and are situated on
poorer land.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers; for England and Wales the Minister of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales, for Scotland
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland. The Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horti¬
culture in England and Wales exists to provide the Minister and his depart¬
ment with independent advice on any agricultural or horticultural subjects
remitted to it.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates through func¬
tional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly
through its local offices, grouped in England in regions, with Chief Regional
Officers. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary with
similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In 1966 an Economic Development Committee for agriculture was estab¬
lished, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and landowners, as well
as official and independent members.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 288) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
Since 1st February 1973 Britain has applied the European Community
system of agricultural support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
(see p. 286). The system is administered by the Intervention Board for Agri¬
cultural Produce; although administratively separate from the agricultural
departments, the board maintains close working links with them and is
responsible to the agricultural ministers, who remain responsible for policy.
The principal tasks of the Intervention Board in administering this system
are the issue and control of export/import licences and the payment of
export and import refunds, market support for certain commodities, in¬
cluding support buying, aids to private storage and the payment of denaturing
premiums. The board also pays the minor Community production and pro¬
ducer subsidies not administered by the agricultural departments.
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Each year, the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and
prospects of the industry in consultation with representatives of agricultural
producers (in practice, the three farmers’ unions of Britain). They consider
such factors as production trends and market requirements, world market
prospects, the cost of subsidies, income trends in the industry as a whole, the
increasing , efficiency of the industry and changes in production costs. The
conclusions drawn from the review contribute, together with views expressed
on behalf of agricultural workers, landowners, consumers and the food
industry, to the formulation of government agricultural policy.
For most commodities British producers now rely for support on the
mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Com¬
munity (CAP). Under the CAP producers’ returns for most of the main
commodities are supported by a combination of charges on imports from
third countries and internal support prices which, for some of the more
important products, are maintained by intervention buying when necessary.
In addition, export refunds enable Community exporters to sell on world
markets when world prices are below Community price levels. There is also
provision for certain direct payments to producers, including variable premiums
payable on cattle and beef. For most commodities Britain is gradually adopting
full Community support price levels over the five-year transitional period
which expires at the end of 1977.
The level of support prices under the CAP is reviewed by the Community
each year, and the results of the British Annual Review (see above) help to
shape the Government’s approach to the negotiations in Brussels on CAP
support.
Price Guarantees In the light of the British Annual Review, agricultural ministers also determine
guaranteed prices for the coming year for potatoes, fat sheep, milk and wool.
Guaranteed prices for other commodities have been terminated in accordance
with the Treaty of Accession (see p. 74). The guaranteed price of milk is
also to be terminated by the end of the transitional period: in the meantime
the level of the guarantee is subject to rules under the Treaty of Accession.
Other Grants and In addition to market support under the CAP and the British guaranteed
Subsidies prices, producers also receive support through certain capital and production
grants. These include grants to help producers with the costs of capital
investment under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme and the Horticulture
Capital Grant Scheme. Grant aid is also available to producers undertaking
development plans under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.
Special financial assistance is also available under Community arrangements
for farmers in hill areas.

Cost of Support Estimated expenditure in 1975-76 on United Kingdom price guarantees,
grants and subsidies is £230 million, of which £4 million is expected to be
reimbursed from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
(FEOGA). Expenditure in the United Kingdom under CAP market regulation
in 1975-76 is estimated at about £305 million, of which some £247 million
is likely to be reimbursed from FEOGA.
Marketing For milk and wool in the United Kingdom the Government operates the

take account of any payments from or to the Government in deciding what to

pay producers for their produce. In the case of milk there are five boards cover¬
ing different areas; the Government pays the guaranteed price on a specified
gallonage termed the standard quantity or the total gallonage sold off farms,
whichever is the less. Any milk produced in excess of the standard quantity
would be sold for manufacturing and the returns from these two sources
averaged by the boards to give the ‘pool price’ paid to producers.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in
advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after
making allowance for the board’s marketing costs.
For potatoes ministers fix each year a target area designed to achieve self-
sufficiency. In Great Britain the Potato Marketing Board ensures, as far as
possible, that this area is planted and may with government agreement under¬
take support buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stock-
feed. In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture undertakes any
support measures. Most of the cost is met by the Government. Any deficiency
payment arising is shared between the Potato Marketing Board and the
Department of Agriculture and can be used to meet the cost of support buying.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. whose funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, with some
government support. Loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural
land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corpora¬
tion Ltd. which works on a similar financial basis to the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. Short-term finance for agricultural machinery is arranged on a
hire purchase basis, whilst medium- or long-term loans are arranged for such
purposes as the purchase of livestock, the erection and improvement of farm
buildings and farm dwellings, and the purchase of land for amalgamation and
subsequent restructuring.
The Government can make loans in Great Britain to help finance the pur¬
chase of land acquired for approved amalgamations of small farms and ap¬
proved remodelling expenditure. These loans may be granted up to 90 per
cent (100 per cent for certain small amalgamations) of the valuation of the
combined unit determined by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. in
England and Wales and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
in Scotland, which act as the Government’s agents.
Where a farmer or grower requires a bank loan for improvements to or
purchase of buildings, machinery, plant, equipment, livestock or working
capital, but cannot provide sufficient collateral, he may be eligible to obtain
medium-term credit through the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd.
The corporation guarantees some or all of the money borrowed from a bank
and the scheme extends to farmers’ and growers’ co-operative associations.
In England and Wales, about 10,000 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 800 lettable holdings by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. For financial assistance in improving smallholdings,’
authorities can obtain the amalgamation and capital grants available to farmers
generally. The minister and local authorities may make loans of up to 75 per
cent of required working capital to their smallholding tenants.

Crofting
Arterial
Drainage and
Sea Defence
Land Tenure
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 167,500 hectares (413,900
acres) of land settlement estates, comprising some 2,930 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (comprising the former counties of
Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and
Shetland) much of the land is held by crofters or tenants whose holdings are
generally either rented at a cost of not more than £100 a year or have an area
not exceeding 30 hectares (75 acres).
The Crofters Commission, with headquarters in Inverness, is responsible
for the administration and regulation of crofting. Its functions are to re¬
organise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting areas, to promote the
interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting. The
commission’s statutory powers include supervising the letting of crofts and
collaborating with other organisations whose activities affect crofting interests.
It also acts as the Secretary of State for Scotland’s agent in administering
grants to crofters for cropping and land improvement.
Ten regional water authorities are responsible for land drainage (including
flood prevention) in England and Wales; they took over these functions from
the former river authorities and catchment boards in 1974. There are no com¬
parable authorities in Scotland, where arterial drainage of agricultural land is
the owners’ responsibility.
The work of the water authorities includes, in both urban and agricultural
areas, the improvement of land drainage, the prevention of inland flooding,
and the construction and maintenance of defences to protect low-lying coastal
areas from tidal flooding. Most of the funds needed are obtained from local
authorities, but the Government pays grants toward the cost of improvement
schemes varying from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial
position of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence works.
Within the water authority areas, in low-lying areas where there are special
local problems of land drainage, there are 305 internal drainage districts
administered by internal drainage boards which carry out work for the special
benefit and protection of their districts. The number of these boards is expected
to decrease slightly as a result of rationalisation carried out in several parts
of the country. The boards finance their work from drainage rates levied on
owners and occupiers. They also receive government grant at a flat rate of
50 per cent for improvement schemes.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants of between 20 per cent and 50 per
cent of the cost of improvement work. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of hill land) are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land who carry out arterial drainage work.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority
for watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor water¬
courses and also has responsibility for urban drainage.
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and
tenants and to eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of
landlord and tenant relationships has been written into legislation.
Legislation provides for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from year to year until
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
289
terminated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can
contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes in¬
operative unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and
Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land
Court) that his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate manage¬
ment or good husbandry or that the land is required for certain specified
purposes.
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termina¬
tion of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and
tenant and may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels,
through producers’ co-operatives or through marketing boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 or Northern Ireland legislation. The
practice of selling under contract is growing. The marketing boards are
producers’ organisations with statutory powers to regulate the marketing of
particular products. The schemes under which they are constituted and
operate must be approved by Parliament and, except in Northern Ireland,
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most board members are elected by the
producers but a minority are appointed by the agriculture minister or minis¬
ters concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which are sole
buyers of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted or
those which exercise a comparable influence by controlling all contracts
between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards which maintain
only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving producers free other¬
wise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops, milk and wool and
the Northern Ireland pigs and seed potato boards fall into the first category
and the Potato Marketing Board into the second.
For certain other commodities there are broadly-based organisations
representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides market intelligence, operates a wheat
classification scheme, and promotes research and development. It also acts
as agent for the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in respect of
the support buying, storage and disposal of cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission is charged with improving the pro¬
duction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It
has a range of executive functions extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion, including acting as agents for the Agricultural Departments and the
Intervention Board in administering price support schemes for fatstock
producers. It is not empowered to trade in either livestock or meat.
The Eggs Authority, which represents the industry and consumers, was set
up with the general duty of improving the marketing of eggs. It provides
market intelligence, carries out promotional work and undertakes research
and development projects.
Under the CAP a wide range of fresh horticultural produce and also cut
flowers and flowering bulbs are subject to common quality standards which,
with certain minor exceptions, apply at all stages of distribution. The Com¬
munity standards apply to all produce entering Britain and to British produce
sold on the domestic market.
Community regulations prescribe grades consisting of a range of up to four
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
classes and specify requirements concerning colour, size, etc., and relating to
packing, presentation and labelling. All fruit and vegetables subject to the
standards which are exported from or imported into the Community must
meet the requirements of at least Class II.
Co-operation
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established to promote and develop co-operation in agriculture and horticul¬
ture and to administer a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural
Co-operation Scheme 1971 provides grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce, including capital grants
on terms similar to those available under the schemes for individual producers
(see p. 286). The Federation of Agricultural Co-operatives represents British
co-operatives both in Britain and in the Community.
CONTROL OF
DISEASES AND
PESTS
Animals
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease nationally in accord¬
ance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the State Veterinary
Service, which is part of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service
(ADAS). The Veterinary Service is also responsible for the administration of
legislation providing for the welfare of farm livestock.
For many years Great Britain has been free from many serious animal
diseases including rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuro pneumonia, sheep pox,
glanders and rabies, except for two isolated cases of rabies in imported dogs
in 1969-70. Orders made under the Rabies Act 1974 subject imports of non¬
farm mammals to the obtaining of an import licence and to six months’
quarantine and give the Government far-ranging powers to deal with an out¬
break. Sheep scab, eradicated in 1952, reappeared in 1973 and is now the subject
of a new eradication campaign; control measures reduced the disease to a low
level by the end of 1973. The campaign to eradicate swine fever was successfully
completed in 1966 and although three cases of the disease occurred in 1971 the
infection was quickly eliminated. An epidemic of a previously unknown
swine vesicular disease began in December i972> V is being combated by a
stringent slaughter policy which has reduced the disease to a low level. A major
epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease was experienced in 1967-68 but was
successfully eradicated. In i960 the whole of Britain became a bovine tuber¬
culosis attested area. The incidence of the disease is now very low; cattle
(except for certain categories) are tested at regular intervals and reactors to
the test are slaughtered; compensation is paid to the owners. Voluntary
schemes for the eradication of brucellosis have been in operation since 1967;
compulsory eradication on an area basis began in 1972. Bythe end of 1975 nearly
65 per cent of all herds in Great Britain were subject to eradication measures.
In August 1975 the first brucellosis attested area was declared, comprising the
Western Isles and Shetland Islands Areas and the former counties of Argyll
and Bute. Newcastle Disease (fowl pest) which had declined considerably
since 1963, reappeared in serious epidemic proportions in 197° anc^ ear^y
1971 in England and Wales and then declined again to a low level.
The work of the Veterinary Service is backed by the extensive facilities of the
Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its sub¬
sidiary laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 24
investigation centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales.
These centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on
disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is pro¬
vided by the investigation centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.

In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Animal health control policies and the
geographical situation have kept the country free from nearly all the major
epizootic diseases, including swine vesicular disease. A Brucellosis Eradica¬
tion Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971 Northern
Ireland was declared a brucellosis-free country. The full-time veterinary
service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at Stormont,
Belfast.
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Certification schemes are
operated to encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-
type planting stocks. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertford¬
shire (part of ADAS), and the Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East
Craigs, Edinburgh, provide scientific and technical advice on which statutory
controls and certification schemes are based.
The Ministry of Agriculture’s Pest Infestation Control Laboratory (a com¬
ponent of ADAS) provides scientific and technical advice on harmful mammals
and birds and on insects, mites and moulds associated with grain and other
stored food products. The laboratory’s headquarters is at Slough, Berkshire,
where storage problems are studied; vertebrate pests are studied at Tol-
worth, Surrey, and Worplesdon, Surrey. The laboratory works closely with
Regional Pest Officers who advise farmers, local authorities and others on
control techniques. Agricultural Scientific Services of the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland have a similar function in Scotland
and maintain close liaison with the laboratory.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Regulations pro¬
vide protection for operators using the more toxic chemicals. Products
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (see p. 174)
may be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme
for efficiency approval. The purpose of this scheme is to enable users and
advisers to choose efficient proprietary brands of agricultural chemicals.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the
control of the manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products
(including those used in animal feedingstuffs). These controls are being
brought into operation in stages. The licensing authority (the agriculture
ministers) is advised by the Medicines Commission, the Veterinary Products
Committee, whose functions are to advise on the safety, quality and efficacy of
veterinary medicinal products, and by other expert licensing committees.
Until the Medicines Act is fully in operation, existing controls restricting the
use of certain antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine will be
kept in force. (For other provisions of the Act, see p. 134.)
The Agricultural Safety Inspectors advise farmers and workers about health
and safety with particular reference to the Health and Safety at Work Act
I974- They are also responsible for enforcing the relevant statutory provisions

including regulations which cover such matters as the guarding of field and
stationary machinery, the safeguarding of work-places, and the fitting of
safety cabs to tractors.
In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the regional and divisional
offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The service also
helps to identify problems requiring investigation and research, to suggest
priorities for such work and where appropriate to contribute to possible
solutions. ADAS provides free, impartial advice to landowners, farmers and
growers but charges are made for certain services.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges of agriculture which are financed almost
entirely by public funds. The nature of service is similar to that provided by
the ADAS”and covers all branches of advice.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Chief
Inspector of the Department of Agriculture and Advisory Centres are located
in the main provincial towns. The resources of the agricultural colleges, the
research centres and the specialist divisions of the department are available to
the advisory service.
An outline of the organisation of agricultural research and development in
Britain, including that carried out by the Agricultural Research Council
(ARC) and the universities, is given on p. 388. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food carries out research and development at its own laboratories
and on the 22 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations operated
by ADAS, and has funds which are used to commission work from the ARC,
the Natural Environment Research Council and outside research organisations.
In England and Wales, research in agricultural economics is undertaken by
12 university departments of agricultural economics. Nine of these and one
college of agriculture conduct work on farm incomes and the economics of
particular products for the ministry (see p. 284).
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has four economic divisions
and two statistics divisions. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the
staff of three agricultural colleges and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has an Economic and
Statistics Division and eight other research divisions.
Fifteen universities in England and Wales, three in Scotland and one in
Northern Ireland provide degree and postgraduate courses in agriculture or
agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural Engineering at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate courses. Sandwich courses
leading to a Higher National Diploma are available at eight agricultural
colleges in England and Wales and there are nearly 50 local authority and
other agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on different aspects of
agriculture, horticulture, forestry and farm management. A centre for Euro¬
pean agricultural studies is based at London University’s Wye College at
Ashford. In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which provide the advisory
services are also teaching establishments, associated with the agricultural
departments of the neighbouring universities. They mainly provide sandwich
courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post-diploma

courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses in
agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time, block-
release, day-release and other part-time courses for farmers, farm workers and
horticulturists, as well as an advisory service for domestic producers.
The Agricultural Training Board, established under the Industrial Training
Act, provides a training advisory service and organises training courses in
agricultural and horticultural subjects. The board gives grants towards the
cost of career training for new entrants, for attendance at approved short
courses, training groups and schemes of training at places of work for those
already engaged in the industry.
FISHERIES
The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned respectively with
demersal fish, pelagic fish and shellfish. The major element of the catch (about
73 per cent by weight) is demersal fish: the catches of pelagic fish comprise
about 18 per cent and shellfish 9 per cent of the total catch. The principal
demersal fish (in terms of value) are cod, haddock, plaice, coalfish (saithe),
whiting, soles and skate. The pelagic species live mainly in midwater or near
the surface: they include herring, sprats and mackerel, of which herring is the
most important. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters, nephrops and
crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles, queens and oysters).
Britain’s exclusive fishing limits were extended to 12 miles in 1964, although
a number of states enjoy historic rights allowing them to fish in designated
parts of a 6-12-mile belt for designated species for which they have traditionally
fished. In July 1976 the Council of the European Community accepted the
principle of extending the limits of fishing zones to 200 miles, fishing within
these limits being subject to the Common Fisheries Policy of the Community,
of which Britain is now seeking a thorough reappraisal. Britain’s fisheries
dispute with Iceland, which began when the interim agreement of November
1973 expired, ended on 1st June 1976 with an agreement which is to last for
six months. Under the terms of the Common Fisheries Policy vessels registered
in member states may also fish within British waters although, by virtue of
arrangements embodied in the Treaty of Accession, which are due for revision
by 1982, they are currently excluded from all areas within 6 miles and certain
areas between 6 and 12 miles.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft, Brixham, Newlyn and Milford Haven. In
Scotland the chief ports for demersal fish are Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraser¬
burgh and Lerwick; herring landings are made mainly at the west coast ports
of Stornoway, Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban and Ayr and in the Shetland Islands.
In Northern Ireland the main fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and
Ardglass.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining and purse-seining.
Trawling is carried out in the distant and near waters for all species of demersal
fish. Seining is also used for catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly
in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde and the Irish Sea.
294
The Fishing
Fleet

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland and the north-east
coast ports of England. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of
Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland and East Anglia.
A mackerel fishery takes place, mainly during the late summer, off the west
coast of Scotland, and during the winter, off south-west England.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessel and
methods of capture; there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, shrimps,
mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland, north-east England
and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of nephrops (Norway lobsters
or Dublin Bay prawns).
Distant water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleet-
wood, number 127. They are 140 feet (427 metres) and over in length and
most of them make voyages lasting up to 80 days to fishing grounds off Iceland,
in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and off the coasts of Norway and
Greenland. Freezer trawlers and factory ships, which spend from one to six
months at sea and freeze much or all of their catch, in some cases as fillets,
have become an important part of the distant water fleet in recent years and
number 44. There are about 407 Scottish seiners, and about 224 operating
from English ports. Excluding seiners, there are about 260 near and middle
water vessels of between 80 and 139 feet (24-5 and 42’4 metres) long and
most of them work nearer home, making voyages lasting from a few days up
to more than two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off
the Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water
group are vessels engaged in fishing for herring which normally make daily
landings. The inshore group consists of some 2,000 vessels of over 40 feet
(12*2 metres) and over 6,000 smaller vessels, many of which do not fish
regularly. The majority are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days
and more usually make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land,
although some seiners operate for up to three weeks in the North Sea.
In the British fishing industry in 1975 there were about 17,500 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,000 occasionally employed, about 45 P®r
cent of the former and 28 per cent of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 600 regular fishermen and 200 part-time.
In 1975 landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 868,948 tonnes (579,032 tonnes of demersal fish,
222,513 tonnes of pelagic and 67,4°3 t°nries °f shellfish), valued at ^151
million. Cod accounted for 44 per cent of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed by British vessels; haddock (19 Per cent) and plaice (7 per
cent) were the other most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 122,706
tonnes valued at nearly ^64 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish
and shellfish amounted to 71,756 tonnes valued at nearly £72 million. Imports
of fish meal amounted to 237,960 tonnes, worth £50 million, and those of
fish oils to 182,895 tonnes, worth nearly £50 million. Exports and re-exports
of fish and fish products amounted to 144,196 tonnes and were worth nearly
£58 million.
Weekly disposal of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 15,000 tonnes landed weight
in 1975. Total fish consumption, which has declined from its peak of 287 lb
(13 kg) per head in 1948 on an edible weight basis, was running at a level of

approximately 147 lb (7 kg) a head in 1975. Home production provided
about 83 per cent of supplies.
Processing and packaging of fish are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has radically altered
the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now
processes just over a quarter of all white fish landings), new export outlets have
opened up for white fish, which account for over 60 per cent of the total
exports of fish and fish preparations. Experiments are being carried out in
the catching and processing, for human consumption and fish meal, of pre¬
viously under-exploited species of fish of which large stocks are known to
exist in the sea adjacent to the British Isles.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and, to a much lesser extent, for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal, including other pelagic fish, in 1975 was
92,700 tonnes.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside exclusive
fishery limits. Within the limits drift netting and certain other methods are
prohibited off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off Eng¬
land, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, where salmon fishing is a
private right, the main commercial methods are fixed nets on the coast out¬
side estuaries and sweep netting within estuaries and in rivers. Water authority
licences are required for the limited amount of estuary and river netting carried
out in England and Wales. In England and Wales the landed value of the
salmon catch in 1975 was approximately £400,000, in Scotland it amounted
to about £27 million and in Northern Ireland to some £288,000. In Northern
Ireland, eels worth £980,000 were captured in 1975 by long lines and by eel
nets placed in river weirs.
The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers, located at the
ports, who buy fish at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers as well as
directly to retail outlets; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward
shipment. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated vehicles, transport
the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although rail transport is still
used from some ports. The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for
fish is Billingsgate Market in London, which handles about 180 tonnes a day,
but other large cities also have central fish markets. Trawler-owning companies
have entered into the marketing and distributive system. This process has
been encouraged by the growing popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by
the Department of Trade. Research is carried out by the fisheries departments.
Common Fisheries From February 1973 the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy of the
Policy European Community, based on the establishment of a common organisa¬
tion of the market and a common structural policy, have applied in Britain. The

common organisation of the market aims at assisting in the adaptation of
supplies to marketing requirements while ensuring, as far as possible, a
reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a common
grading and price system, and common rules on competition. Provision is
also made for the protection of the Community market against disruption by
imports from third countries. The responsibility for market organisation is
placed largely in the hands of the industry itself through producers’ organisa¬
tions established on the initiative of the industry. Tariff adjustments for intra-
Community trade in fish and trade with third countries are following the
general agricultural timetable (see p. 286).
The common structural policy covers measures aimed at promoting the
harmonious and balanced development of the fishing industry and the rational
exploitation of resources. It covers access to waters under the jurisdiction of
member states, conservation in coastal waters and common measures for the
financing of the improvement of the structure of the fishing industry and the
provision of an equitable standard of living for those engaged in it (see p. 293).
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry and consists of a chairman and two other members, all
part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The board, whose activities are
financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants
and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, which repre¬
sents all sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distribution. The board administers the government grant and loan
schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under 80
feet (about 24-5 metres) in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear.
Up to 31st March 1976 about £5-8 million in loans and £7-5 million in grants
had been approved.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authority is composed of a
chairman and six members, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Committee of
five members and a chairman who is a member of the authority; membership
is by appropriate ministerial appointment. The White Fish Industry Advisory
Council, which represents the various interests of the fishing industry,
advises the authority about the exercise and performance of its functions.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan schemes
for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of
existing vessels. It also administers loans to processors, co-operatives, etc.,
for the acquisition, reconditioning or improvement of facilities. Up to 31st
March 1976 about £45 million in loans and £55 million in grants had been
approved. Its other activities are financed by levies on first-hand sales of most
white fish, and a government grant towards research and development. In

AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 2Q7
1973 the Herring Industry Board and White Fish Authority formed a unified
administration for the expected development of fisheries administration under
the Common Fisheries Policy.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Great Britain is dqS million hectares
(4-89 million acres), or about 8-7 per cent of the total land area; 46 per cent of
the area is in England, 43 per cent in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
0-83 million hectares (2 million acres) constitutes 49 per cent of this category.
The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently about 18,000
hectares (44,000 acres) by the commission mainly in Scotland, and some
10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) by private woodland owners. The commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, and consists mainly
of conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered. The major
species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine, Scots pine, Corsican pine and
larches. In the older woodlands and taking the country as a whole, the most
common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and
the larches; among the broadleaved, beech and oak occur widely.
Total employment in state and private forests was estimated at 22,000 in
1975 and a further 11,000 people were engaged in the transport and milling of
home-grown timber.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as only some 30
per cent of the commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports
more than 90 per cent of its needs, the total import cost of wood and wood
products including pulp and paper being £1,400 million in 1975.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The commission consists of
a part-time chairman, a full-time director general, three full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p. 299). Since 1974
the main objective of forestry in Great Britain, timber production, has
explicitly taken account of amenity, environmental and employment criteria.
The commission’s total estate covers some 1 -23 million hectares (3‘04 million
acres) and includes 0-91 million hectares (2-25 million acres) of forest land,
of which 0-83 million hectares (2 million acres) are under trees in 250 forests
distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests are
covered by management plans which provide for such work as planting,
road construction, thinning, fire protection and timber production, facilities
for public recreation, wildlife conservation and the landscaping of plantations.
Much of the Forestry Commission’s new planting in Scotland is in the
Highland counties, where poorer types of land, such as sour, peaty soil which
is unsuitable for agricultural purposes, are used for tree planting after deep
ploughing and the application of fertiliser.
As more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage the commission,
as managers of the National Forestry Enterprise, has assumed an increasingly

important role as a timber seller and has encouraged the setting up of some 20
major new timber-using industries since the mid-1960s.
Production of felled and thinned timber from commission woodlands
amounted to 1-54 million cubic metres in 1975-76. Some of this produce is
meeting traditional requirements of the coal mines but much is taken by the
paper pulp industry, by sawmdls and by factories established to make chip¬
board, fibreboard and wood wool.
The Forestry Fund was constituted under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
amounts voted annually by Parliament, together with the commission’s
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. In the period ended
31st March 1976 drawings from funds voted by Parliament amounted to
^26-9 million, and receipts were ^23-9 million.
Privately-owned woods comprise 57 per cent of the total forest area in Great
Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The size
of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few hectares to several
thousand hectares and about half of the private woodland area is in ownerships
of under 100 hectares (250 acres) in extent.
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the pro¬
vision of grants. In 1974 a single woodlands dedication scheme replaced the
three earlier schemes. Under the new arrangements once-for-all planting
grants, based on area, are made available, in return for which owners accept
a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in accordance with sound
forestry practice. There are premium rates of grant for planting hardwoods.
The Forestry Commission consults with the agricultural departments and
local planning authorities before administering grant aid for private forestry.
Woodland owners are represented, in their relations with the Forestry Com¬
mission, by the Forestry Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the
work of the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in England and Wales)
and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
Under the Forestry Act 1967, the Forestry Commissioners have set up for
Great Britain the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee (HGTAC) to
advise on certain statutory functions, including promoting the interests of
forestry and the production and supply of timber. The HGTAC includes
representatives of associations of woodland owners, timber merchants, pro¬
cessors, and other major timber users and the trade unions, under an inde¬
pendent chairman. It maintains a technical sub-committee to advise it on
subjects such as harvesting, transport and utilisation of home-grown timber.
The Forestry Commissioners also maintain National Committees for
England, Scotland and Wales, which act in an advisory capacity, particularly
on the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the commissioners activities
and relationships with other land users. The commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy, whose members represent
local amenity and planning interests as well as the forestry industry, and,
because of its special nature, a consultative panel for the New Forest.
Forestry education is the responsibility of the education departments. Degree
and courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at four universities
(Aberdeen, Bangor, Edinburgh and Oxford) and supervisory level courses
are run at Newton Rigg, near Penrith in Cumbria.

The Forestry Training Council, whose membership is representative of

education services, the forestry societies and the relevant industrial training
boards, makes recommendations to the industry for meeting requirements for
training and associated further education, and encourages co-operation at all
levels between the agencies and authorities concerned. The Furniture and
Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with training for private-sector
employees in the home timber trade.
Research at the commission’s Southern Forest Research Station at Alice
Holt Lodge in Surrey is largely concerned with lowland forests, landscaping
and amenity problems, and with the study of hardwood trees. Work at the
Northern Research Station at Roslin near Edinburgh is linked to the needs of
forest management with special reference to upland forestry. Expenditure on
research work in Great Britain amounted to ^2-39 million in 1975-76. This
sum included grants for special forestry research work to university depart¬
ments and to various institutions, including the Commonwealth Forestry
Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by the university, the Ministry of
Overseas Development and overseas governments. Research into the qualities
and uses of home-grown timber is carried out by Princes Risborough Labora¬
tory, and also by grant-aided associations.
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland. It
can acquire and manage land, and give financial and technical assistance to
private planting. It has introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands
against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. Over 66,000 hectares (163,000 acres) have been acquired, of which over
48,000 hectares (119,000 acres) have been planted.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and from
receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,500 people are em¬
ployed in the state forests. There are also about 14,500 hectares (36,000 acres)
of privately-owned forests, and private planting is assisted by schemes for the
supply of young trees from the department’s nurseries at a low cost, by grants
towards the cost of the establishment and maintenance of plantations and by
free technical advice.
15 Transport and
Communications
Transport and communications contribute over 9 per cent of the gross
national product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of the
nation’s gross domestic fixed capital formation. These activities employed
some 1-5 million people in Great Britain in June 1975 and accounted for 7
per cent of the employed labour force. Of these, 446,000 employees were
engaged in road passenger transport and road haulage contracting, 227,000
in railways, 439,000 in postal services and telecommunications, 72,000 in
port and inland water transport, 87,000 in sea transport, 77,000 in air trans¬
port and 146,000 in other transport services and storage.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by road.
However, rail, coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. In 1975 about 66 per cent of freight, in terms of tonne-kilometres,
travelled by road, 17 per cent by rail, 14 per cent by coastal shipping, and
3 per cent by pipeline and inland waterway.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is publicly owned:
the railways, most road passenger and some road haulage services, most of
the inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Road haulage is
largely, and coastal shipping almost entirely, in the hands of private enterprise.
In the third quarter of 1975 there were 17-5 million vehicles licensed for use
on the roads of Great Britain. Of these 137 million were motor cars, i-8
million road goods vehicles, 1-2 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds
and 112,000 public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private owner¬
ship of cars has been growing rapidly for many years and the car is now the
most popular form of travel within Great Britain.
Government The Government has undertaken a review of transport policy and in April
Policy i976 published a comprehensive consultation document. In the light of
comments, the Government will announce in 1977 its decisions on the future
direction of transport policy.
ROADS There are three main categories of road in Great Britain: trunk roads
(including most motorways which cater for high-speed traffic) which carry
most of the long-distance traffic; classified roads; and unclassified roads.
The primary purpose of the Government’s road building programme in
England is to complete a 3,100-mile (4,989-kilometre) strategic network of
trunk roads which will link the major centres of industry and population and
the ports. This will benefit industry, relieve towns and villages of heavy
through traffic and help to reduce road accidents. About 2,000 miles (3,219
kilometres) of this network are in use and the remaining 1,100 miles (1,770
kilometres) should be completed by the mid-1980s. Priority in the pro-

gramme is being given to those schemes, such as by-passes of historic towns,
which will bring major economic and environmental benefits. In Wales one
of the Government’s first priorities is to improve links between the main
ports of south Wales. In Scotland the highest priority in the road programme
is being given to oil-related road developments. The Government is generally
opposed to the building of new urban motorways because of their environ¬
mental impact and high cost, although in exceptional circumstances their
construction may be required.
In 1974 road traffic declined for the first time since 1957, primarily as a
result of substantially higher fuel costs, after several years of growth averaging
5 per cent a year. Traffic recovered slightly in 1975, rising by I-8 per cent to
241,182 million vehicle-kilometres, of which cars and taxis accounted for
80 per cent.
In mid-1976 Great Britain had about 214,000 miles (344,400 kilometres) of
public highway. There were 9,670 miles (15,562 kilometres) of trunk roads,
of which 1,322 miles (2,128 kilometres) were motorways; 20,500 miles (32,992
kilometres) of principal roads, of which some 60 miles (97 kilometres) were
motorways; and 183,830 miles (295,846 kilometres) of other roads.
In Northern Ireland in mid-1976 there were 14,430 miles (23,223 kilo¬
metres) of public roads comprising 395 miles (636 kilometres) of trunk roads,
1,033 miles (1,662 kilometres) of Class I roads, 1,760 miles (2,832 kilometres)
of Class II roads, 2,938 miles (4,728 kilometres) of Class III roads and 8,304
miles (13,364 kilometres) of unclassified roads.
At the end of March 1976 in England 1,185 miles (1,907 kilometres) of trunk
motorways had been opened for traffic and construction had started on a
further 84 miles (135 kilometres). There were some 55 miles (89 kilometres)
of local authority motorway in use and a further 4 miles (6 kilometres) under
construction. In Wales 27 miles (43 kilometres) of trunk motorway were in
use and 30 miles (48 kilometres) under construction. In Scotland about 115
miles (185 kilometres) of trunk and local authority motorway had been opened
and construction had started on a further 11 miles (18 kilometres). About 67
miles (108 kilometres) of motorway were in use in Northern Ireland. The
motorway network in Britain is shown on the map at the end of the book.
Modern bridges include the suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth and
the Severn Bridge, both incorporating major advances in suspension bridge
design, and a £10 million continuous steel box-girder bridge across the
river Clyde at Erskine. A bridge across the river Humber, with a span of
4,626 feet (1,410 metres)—longer than any existing bridge span in the world—
is to be completed in 1978.
Among major recent tunnel schemes has been the second Mersey crossing
of which the first twin tunnel was opened in 1971 and the second in 1974. A
second crossing of the Thames at Hartford, Kent, is under construction and
should be completed in 1977.
Britain’s road accident record is considerably better than that of many other
countries, even though it has one of the highest densities of road traffic in
the world. There has been a long-term decline in road casualties and a
substantial fall in casualty rates. In 1975, 6,350 people were killed on the roads
of Great Britain, about 77,000 seriously injured and 241,000 slightly injured.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
302
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. There are three classes of national
speed limit: a general limit of 30 mph (48 km/h) in built-up areas; a limit of
70 mph (113 km/h) on motorways; and temporary fuel-saving limits of 60
mph (97 km/h) and 50 mph (80 km/h) on other non-motorway dual and single
carriageway roads respectively. To meet local needs the urban limit can be
raised and the other limits lowered on specific stretches of road. Other measures
directed primarily towards road safety include the provision of pedestrian
crossings and the system of road markings and traffic signs. A computer-
controlled signalling system has been installed on most busy motorways to
warn motorists of' advisory speed limits in certain conditions and of lane
closures.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations. The regulations are kept
under constant review, and amended whenever necessary in the interests of
safety or for control of pollution and noise. The Government intends to
introduce a ‘type approval’ scheme under which the sale of cars first manu¬
factured after the end of September 1977 and first licensed for use in Great
Britain after 1st April 1978 will not be permitted unless they are of a type
that has been certified as meeting the required standards. In Great Britain
private cars and light vans which are three or more years old must be tested
annually at private garages authorised as test stations. In Northern Ireland
private cars eight or more years old are tested at official vehicle inspection
centres. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at government test stations.
Public service vehicles must be specially approved before being licensed to
carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals. Any vehicle may be
stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined.
Minimum ages for driving are: 16 for driving invalid carriages and mopeds;
17 for passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that of the
driver), motorcycles and goods vehicles not over 3-5 tonnes maximum
weight; 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not over 7-5 tonnes; and 21 for
passenger vehicles with over nine seats and goods vehicles over 7-5 tonnes.
All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must hold a ‘provisional’ licence, display ‘L’ (learner) plates on their vehicle
and be accompanied while driving (except on a two-wheeled vehicle or in a
one-seat vehicle) by a qualified driver. (Newly arrived residents of Britain
may drive under their overseas driving licences for three months before
becoming subject to these rules.) In Northern Ireland a driver having passed
the test is required to display an ‘R’ (restricted) plate for a one-year period
during which he must not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). Professional driving
instructors must be approved by the Department of Transport. There are
schemes for special licensing and testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles and
public service vehicles. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre at Swansea,
which began operating in 1973, will eventually deal with all licensing and
registration of vehicles and drivers in Great Britain.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users and a summary of the requirements of
the law are set out in the Highway Code. A failure to observe the code does
not render a person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into

account in such proceedings. The Road Safety Act 1967 made it an offence
to drive with more than a prescribed level of alcohol in the blood, at present
80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The Secretary of State
for Transport proposes to introduce regulations for Great Britain requiring
the wearing of seat belts where they are fitted in the front seats of cars or vans.
It is estimated that compulsory wearing will save nearly 1,000 deaths and
11,000 serious injuries a year.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are
conducted by government departments and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents with assistance from local authorities. In recent
years major publicity campaigns have been undertaken to increase the
wearing of seat belts and reduce pedestrian casualties.
With the exception of trunk roads, which are the concern of the central
Government, traffic is the responsibility of local authorities. Urban transport
planning has involved the development of medium-term transport studies,
which have been carried out or are in progress in many cities and towns in
Great Britain. Following a study the local authority adopts a preferred strategy
which provides the framework for more detailed short-term traffic manage¬
ment and public transport operational measures.
Several cities have abandoned extensive urban motorway schemes in favour
of limiting the amount of traffic permitted to enter central areas and providing
better public transport. Limited urban road improvements are continuing, but
local authorities are relying on measures to improve traffic flow and road
safety, and, in some cases, to assist the flow of certain types of vehicle, usually
buses. Comprehensive traffic management schemes may include ‘one-way’
systems, improved traffic signal control and area traffic control systems, park¬
ing controls, pedestrian precincts and bus lanes. Following experiments on
methods to control by computer a large number of traffic signals in an urban
area, several local authorities are installing these systems. The first purpose-
built automatic traffic control system for a whole city was opened in Leicester
in 1974. In most town centres street parking is permitted for limited periods
only; in London and many other towns schemes for payment at parking meters
or residents’ parking spaces are under the supervision of traffic wardens. In
many big cities new shopping precincts are specially designed for pedestrians
and motor traffic is excluded. Streets in many town centres have been con¬
verted wholly or partly to pedestrian use.
The Government’s road programme (see p. 300) is designed so that even¬
tually heavy goods vehicles will be able to avoid town centres and residential
suburbs wherever possible. The Government is devising, in co-operation with
local authorities, a system of lorry routes.
Research on roads is carried out at the Department of Transport’s Transport
and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL). The laboratory provides technical
and scientific advice and information to help in formulating, developing
and implementing government policies relating to roads and transport,
including their interaction with urban and regional planning. Work is con¬
cerned with planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads and
structures such as bridges and tunnels; safe, efficient and convenient move¬
ment of people and goods, including road layout and transport networks,
control of traffic flow, study of road accidents and methods of reducing their
frequency and severity; assessment of existing and projected passenger or
freight transport systems and investigation of technical developments and

their environmental effects. The TRRL employs over 1,000 people of whom
about half are scientists and engineers.
In England the Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland the Secretary of
State for Scotland, and in Wales the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible
for the administration of trunk motorways and other trunk roads, and the costs
of their construction, improvement and maintenance are provided by central
Government. Work on major trunk road schemes in England, including
motorways, is controlled by regional road construction units, manned jointly
by Department of Transport and county council staff. The highway authority
for non-trunk roads in England and Wales is, in general, the county council in
whose area the roads lie. Part of the block grant to the highway authorities to¬
wards transport expenditure (see p. 305) is attributable to their expenditure
on the construction, improvement and maintenance of non-trunk roads. In
Scotland the highway authority for non-trunk roads is the regional or islands
council and the cost of maintenance and construction of these roads is eligible
for grant under an extensin of the rate support grant system.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for public roads and bears the cost of maintenance and
construction.
There are some 140,000 operators in the road haulage industry. Many are
small firms, the average size of a vehicle fleet being only about four. Most of
the industry is privately owned, but the biggest operator in Great Britain is
the National Freight Corporation (NFC), a public corporation established
under the Transport Act 1968 to operate road and intermodal freight services.
Its turnover amounted to £291 million in 1975 and at the end of 1975 it had
44,600 employees and owned or leased 22,400 vehicles, 18,100 trailers and
12,300 containers and demountable bodies. The Government’s policy is to
extend public ownership in the road haulage industry. Public haulage (private
road hauliers and the NFC carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for 64 per
cent of freight carried in Great Britain in terms of tonne-kilometres. In
Northern Ireland the biggest operator is Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd.,
owned jointly by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and
the NFC.
Under the Transport Act 1968 those operating vehicles of over 3! tons gross
weight (with certain special exemptions) require an operator’s licence,
obtained on showing good repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and
control loading and hours worked by drivers. It may also be necessary to
demonstrate adequate financial resources for compliance with these conditions.
Over 1 million goods vehicles not exceeding 3^ tons gross laden weight are
exempt from operators’ licensing.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the
carriage of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by
drivers of goods vehicles. International road haulage is governed mainly by
bilateral agreements, concluded with 22 other European countries, which
authorise British road hauliers to carry goods to or through these countries.
Permits are required in some cases, in most of which the number is limited
to a quota negotiated annually. Within the European Community there is
also a Community quota which authorises holders of a limited number of
permits to carry out hire and reward operations between any two member
countries.

Public road passenger transport in Britain is provided mainly by publicly
owned operators. In the public sector in Great Britain 25,400 vehicles are
operated by the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group,
11,100 by the seven passenger transport executives, 6,900 by the London
Transport Executive and 6,200 by other local authority undertakings. There
are more than 5,600 privately owned undertakings (of which the majority
have fewer than five vehicles) comprising some 27,800 vehicles; only a small
proportion of these operators are concerned with scheduled bus services.
There are 11 traffic areas in Great Britain each under the jurisdiction of an
independent body of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used to carry passengers for
hire or reward, and for licensing public road passenger services in order to
secure proper co-ordination and to avoid unnecessary competition; to this
end they may settle routes, timetables and fares.
A new system of grants for local transport came into operation on 1st April
1975 in England and Wales, replacing a number of grants previously paid on
specific services at varying rates. A block grant is paid to each county council
on expenditure on local transport services above a certain level. Below this
level transport expenditure qualifies for the normal rate support grant. The
Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office distribute the grants
following the annual submission by county councils and the Greater London
Council of their five-year transport plans. In Scotland the new grant system,
which came into operation on 16th May 1975, is based on an extension of the
rate support grant.
In addition, grants at the rate of 50 per cent are available towards the cost of
new buses complying with specifications approved by the Department of
Transport. The Government also makes grants to offset the duty charged on
fuel used on local bus services.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Ribble
Motor Services Ltd. and Crosville Motor Services Ltd. At the end of 1975 it
owned some 20,500 vehicles and employed 70,500 people. In 1975 passenger
journeys on the company’s buses amounted to 2,040 million, gross revenue
was ^301 million and the company made a loss of £19 million.
The Scottish Transport Group (with 4,300 vehicles) operates all the main
bus services in Scotland outside the major cities. It also runs shipping
services to the main islands off the west coast of Scotland; modernised
vehicle ferries have been introduced on many of these services.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd. operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd. operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 300
and 900 vehicles respectively.
In the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West
Midlands, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, the
metropolitan county council, acting as the passenger transport authority
(PTA), controls and co-ordinates different forms of transport, as well as
being responsible for land use policy and transport matters in general. In
Scotland the Strathclyde Regional Council is the PTA for Greater Glasgow

although the passenger transport area does not cover all of the region. The
PTAs are responsible for policy as a whole, and appoint professional passenger
transport executives (PTEs) to be responsible for day-to-day management
and operations. The PTEs operate bus services in their areas and are respon¬
sible for reaching agreements with the British Railways Board concerning
the provision of such rail services as are considered necessary by the PTAs.
Several similar agreements have been reached with other bodies, including
National Bus Company subsidiaries.
The Greater London Council (GLC) is the transport planning authority for
London as a whole and is responsible for the central bus and Underground
rail services, managed and operated by the London Transport Executive
which is appointed by the GLC. The buses serving areas around London and
the long-distance Green Line coach services are run by London Country Bus
Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. Some 11,700 taxi¬
cabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately operated by companies or
owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the Metropolitan Police. There
are about 16,000 licensed cab drivers. In addition, numerous car-hire firms
are in operation.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 22 miles (35 kilometres) from
north to south and 35 miles (56 kilometres) from east to west. In January 1976
the total length of the railway over which London Transport trains operated
was 251 miles (404 kilometres), of which nearly 100 miles (161 kilometres)
were underground. London Transport trains serve 278 stations and its
buses travel over 1,739 miles (2,799 kilometres) of roads. To carry traffic over
all this area London Transport owns 4,409 railway cars and 6,907 buses.
The total staff employed is over 60,000.
London Transport is engaged on a 20-year modernisation programme for
the Underground. Improvements planned include an extension of automatic
ticket issue and control and the introduction of new signalling and train
control techniques. Work is in progress on the construction of the first stage
of the new Fleet line, which is projected to link north-west and central
London, and on a scheme to extend the Piccadilly line to Heathrow airport
the section to Hatton Cross was opened in 1975 and the extension should be
completed in 1977. Plans to improve bus services include the introduction
of a limited network of services using continuous bus lanes.
Development Improvements to public transport services are being undertaken in many
areas of Britain to try to halt the substantial decline in the use of public
transport due primarily to the growth in ownership of private cars. These
include express and/or limited-stop bus services, ‘park and ride’ bus services
between suburban car parks and town centres, and ‘postbus’ services (Post
Office minibuses carrying mail and passengers) in rural areas. ‘Dial-a-bus
services, which pick up passengers as a result of a telephone call to a central
control point, are being evaluated in a number of areas; some of the largest
and most advanced dial-a-bus projects in Europe are at Harlow (Essex),
Solihull (West Midlands) and Sale (Greater Manchester). Many uneconomic
bus services have been withdrawn, particularly in rural areas, leaving some
villages without access to public transport; the Government intends to
introduce a number of experimental services to assess ways of meeting the
transport needs of rural communities.
Urban rail projects are proceeding in several areas. In Greater Glasgow

two major rail projects are being undertaken by the PTE to modernise the
underground system and to reopen and electrify the central low-level line,
the major part of the ‘Clyderail’ scheme which is designed to improve
access to the centre of Glasgow and integrate rail services on the north and
south banks of the Clyde. On Merseyside two complementary railway schemes,
partly underground, are due to open in 1977. A light rapid transit system under
construttion on Tyneside involves the electrification of two suburban railway
lines, linked by new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and
a new bridge over the Tyne. The first section should be open in 1978 and the
whole system, 34 miles (55 kilometres) long with 46 stations, should be in
operation by the early 1980s. The project is the largest provincial urban
transport scheme to have been prepared in Britain in the twentieth century.
The railways first came under government direction during the first world
war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated into four
large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Following the second
world war the Transport Act 1947 brought the railways in Great Britain
under public ownership as a single enterprise. In 1963 the British Railways
Board was set up with sole responsibility for managing railway affairs.
In 1973 board and the Government completed a comprehensive review
of railway policy. It was concluded that a railway network of roughly the
present size and quality could be maintained only through continuing and
substantial financial support from the Government. Accordingly, since the
beginning of 1975 the board has been obliged by the Government to operate
the rail passenger network; it is compensated by the Government for the
net annual loss.
t975 the railway network operated by British Rail amounted to 11,258
route-miles (18,118 kilometres) of which 2,271 miles (3,655 kilometres) were
electrified. A total of 715 million passenger journeys was made and 176 million
tonnes of freight traffic carried by rail. Total railway receipts amounted to
£774 million (excluding financial support for current operations of £409-6
million, which included £324-1 million in respect of public service obligations
for the passenger network and a special grant of £66-3 million to meet the
deficit on freight and parcels). The board made a loss of £6o-8 million following
interest payments of £32-5 million. Capital expenditure amounted to about
£110 million. At the end of 1975 it employed 251,600 people and operated
3,508 diesel and 352 electric locomotives, 3,412 diesel and 7,225 electric
passenger multiple-unit vehicles, 6,826 passenger carriages and a fleet of
216,400 freight vehicles.
British Rail Engineering Ltd. has 13 main workshops, employing about
35>300 people, mostly on the repair and construction of British locomotives,
rolling stock and containers, although some manufacturing work is done for
export. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby employs about 2,500 people
and has a £5 million research and development programme. British Trans¬
port Hotels Ltd. runs 29 hotels and controls Travellers-Fare, responsible
for catering facilities on trains and at stations. British Rail’s Shipping and
International Services division, which carries more sea-going passengers
than any other fleet in the world, operated a fleet of 43 vessels in 1975,
providing passenger and freight services on most of the important routes
between Britain and the Irish Republic and on the short-sea routes to the
continent of Europe, as well as on some domestic routes. British Rail Hover-

craft Ltd. runs hovercraft services (see p. 317). Transportation Systems and

In recent years the most important developments have been the replacement
of steam by diesel and electric traction completed in 1968; the improvement
of inter-city passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability, com¬
fort and better train connections; and an increase in freight trainload traffic,
allowing higher speeds, and greater mechanisation in the carrying of coal,
other bulk commodities and containers. The standards of track and signalling
are being raised to allow faster running speeds and improved operating
efficiency.
The two main functions of the passenger network are the provision of the
high-speed inter-city network, linking the main centres of Great Britain,
and of commuter services in and around the large conurbations, especially
London and the South East. The board’s plans for inter-city services include
a programme to replace old passenger coaches by new air-conditioned stock.
Some 59 ‘high speed trains’ are on order; the prototype entered regular
passenger service in 1975 and the first of the remainder will begin carrying
passengers in the Western Region in October 1976. They will operate at a
sustained speed of 125 mph (201 km/h). Higher speeds will follow the intro¬
duction into service of the advanced passenger train (APT) capable of speeds
up to 155 mph (250 km/h). Development work, which has included the
construction of an experimental APT, has involved fundamental research
into the guidance and stability of railway vehicles which will enable sub¬
stantially higher speeds to be attained on existing track. Three prototype
electric APTs are being built and will enter service between London and
Glasgow in 1978, covering the 400-mile (644-kilometre) journey in four
hours. The electrification of this route was the largest capital investment
project ever undertaken by the British Railways Board and included station
reconstruction, bridgeworks, new colour-light signalling and new rolling
stock. Train speeds of 100 mph (161 km/h) are now common on most of
British Rail’s main lines.
Motorail services (carrying both passengers and their cars) have an annual
capacity of over 100,000 cars on 50 services.
The board’s proposals for commuter services include the development of
new multiple-unit trains to replace old stock, while several urban railway
projects are in progress (see p. 307).
The most important freight commodities handled in 1975 were coal and coke
(97 million tonnes) and iron and steel (26 million tonnes). In recent years
attention has been directed towards other traffic, especially petroleum
products, cars and motor components, refuse, roadstone and construction
materials, and containers.
The efficiency of freight operations is being improved as new types of
wagon are introduced with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds; a
network of regular high-speed freight services using these new wagons is
being established. Freight traffic is being concentrated at fewer and better
equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals. The installation of a
computer-based total operations processing system, allowing continuous
monitoring of all consignments and freight train and wagon movements in
Great Britain, has reduced operating and maintenance costs by the more

intensive use of rolling stock and will enable British Rail to withdraw 20,000
obsolete freight vehicles. The board is concentrating on traffic particularly
suitable for carriage by rail, especially long-distance and bulk trainloa
traffic, often between specialised company terminals. Long-term contracts
are in operation for the carriage of cars, oil, china clay, milk, newspapers,
grain, chemicals, coal, steel, refuse, and sand and gravel aggregates. The
‘merry-go-round’ system, whereby trains are loaded and discharged auto¬
matically while in motion, is being used increasingly where there are heavy
flows of mineral traffic, such as the carriage of coal to power stations and
iron ore to steelworks. Express container services are operated by Freight-
liners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the National Freight Corporation
(see p. 304) and the British Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent
of the shares respectively).
Discussions initiated by the Government are in progress between many ot
Britain’s largest firms and the British Railways Board on the potential for
transferring freight to the railways.
Private Railways There are several small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in
Great Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing hmite
services for tourists and railway enthusiasts; the principal aim of many of
these railways is the preservation of steam traction. Some are narrow gauge
railways, while others run on former British Rail track.
Railways in
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service on 200
miles (322 kilometres) of track. A £10 million scheme to streamline the
railway network in the Belfast area is in progress. The Belfast central line
was re-opened early in 1976 following modernisation and rationalisation o
stations. Delivery of the last of the new rolling stock to complete the scheme
is expected in 1977.
INLAND
WATERWAYS
In Great Britain there are about 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometres) of canal an
river navigations, of which about 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometres) are con¬
trolled by the publicly owned British Waterways Board. A further 500 miles
(805 kilometres) are managed by the regional water authorities and the
remaining 500 miles (805 kilometres) are controlled by local authorities,
independent commissioners, companies or charitable trusts. As part of the
Government’s proposals to reorganise the structure of the water industry
(see p. 274), the British Waterways Board might be merged within a centralised
structure to form the nucleus of a national navigation authority.
Inland waterways are important for land drainage and water supply and
are popular for recreation (see p. 442). Among the most popular canal and
river navigations are the river Thames (managed by the Thames Water
Authority); the Norfolk Broads (managed by independent commissioners);
and the Llangollen branch of the Shropshire Union Canal, the Oxford
Canal, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal (managed by the British Water¬
ways Board). , rQ
In 1975 the turnover of the British Waterways Board amounted to £8-5
million. The board received government grants of £8 million in 1975, most
of which were used to maintain its waterways to statutory standards. Some
340 miles (547 kilometres) of the board’s waterways are commercial water¬
ways, maintained for use by freight-carrying vessels, and about 1,100 mi es
(1,770 kilometres) are cruising waterways, maintained for use by pleasure
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
311
craft. The principal commercial waterways are the river navigations and
broad canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area. The board also operates
docks, warehouses and inland freight terminals, and has a freight-carrying
fleet, although most of the freight traffic on its waterways (4*2 million tonnes
in 1975) is handled by independent carriers or by traders in their own craft.
Limited improvements are being undertaken to cater for freight traffic.
The British Waterways Board is operating on some of its commercial water¬
ways a specially designed interlocking modular barge system.
PORTS
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port Authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies. The Government intends that all commercial ports and cargo¬
handling facilities should eventually be brought under public ownership and
control; this would involve the establishment of a new National Ports
Authority to exercise essential central controlling functions.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a quarter of total
capacity, the majority, including Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport,
Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks Board. In
1975 shipping arrivals and departures at the board’s docks totalled 131
million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo handled
was 77-3 million tonnes. The board’s revenue totalled £77-5 million and it
achieved a net surplus of ^i^ million. The British Railways Board controls
certain ports, which are largely used for its shipping services to the continent of
Europe, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic (for example, Folkestone,
Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay at Harwich) while the
British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester) and Weston Point
(Manchester).
The constitutions of public trust port authorities traditionally consisted
of representatives of shippers, importers, exporters, shipping companies,
local authorities and trade unions. However, recently a number of the major
trust port authorities (such as the Port of London Authority, the Port of
Tyne Authority, the Clyde Port Authority and the Forth Ports Authority)
have been reconstituted and the reconstitution of some other port authorities
is in progress. The main features are fewer members, a greater proportion of
executive members and the appointment of non-executive members by the
Government. Local authorities own about one-third of Britain’s ports,
including Bristol, Preston and Sunderland. Port undertakings owned by
statutory companies include Manchester and Liverpool. Many private ports
deal with the traffic of individual industrial firms in commodities such as
petroleum, china clay and paper pulp.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port authori¬
ties in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
National Ports
Council
The National Ports Council, set up as a statutory body under the Harbours
Act 1964, is financed by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government
on major port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to
research, training, statistics and charges.

Port Traffic
Principal Ports

Terminals
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Over 315 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great
Britain. Coastal traffic accounts for over 90 million tonnes consisting mainly
of petroleum and coal. Of some 175 million tonnes of imports from overseas,
about 102 million tonnes consist of petroleum and petroleum products.
Manufactured goods form about two-fifths of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried 29 million tonnes of goods in 1975. London, Felix¬
stowe, Dover, Southampton and Hull all handled large amounts.
London is Britain’s largest port for non-fuel traffic. In 1975, 41 million tonnes
of goods were handled, including 23 million tonnes of petroleum. South¬
ampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic and the main trading port
on the south coast. It has the advantages of deep water and double tides.
Medway is an important port for petroleum and petroleum products. Some of
the ports in the South East and East Anglia, particularly Dover, Felixstowe and
Harwich, are growing rapidly with modern facilities especially for roll-on/
roll-off and container traffic. Dover is Britain’s leading port for passengers and
roll-on/roll-off traffic.
Liverpool is a very important export outlet, especially to countries outside
Europe and the Mediterranean. The inland port of Manchester, reached from
the Mersey via the 36-mile (58-kilometre) Manchester Ship Canal, exports
manufactured goods and chemicals.
The port of Tees and Hartlepool handles petroleum products, chemicals,
iron and steel, and iron ore. The port of Tyne and some other north-east coast
ports, such as Blyth and Sunderland, have an important outward trade in
coal. Grimsby and Hull are Britain’s two main fishing ports; with Immingham
they also serve the industrial areas of northern England and the Midlands,
especially in trade with Scandinavian and Baltic ports. Immingham handles
imports of iron ore and crude oil and exports of coal and petroleum products.
Milford Haven, handling 45 million tonnes a year, is Britain’s major oil port
and now Britain’s leading seaport in terms of tonnage handled. Much of the
traffic through the other south Wales ports is connected with the local steel
industry—imports of iron ore and exports of iron and steel, and tinplate.
In Scotland the principal port facilities serving the central industrial area
are Greenock (handling particularly containers and raw sugar) and Glasgow
(iron ore and grain) on the Clyde, and Grangemouth (containers and timber)
and Leith (grain and whisky) on the Forth. The Clyde also has a major crude
oil terminal at Finnart. Aberdeen is Britain’s third largest fishing port.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne handles
the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their own refineries. British ports offer the deepest water access in Northern
Europe for fully laden tankers to pipe crude oil direct to refineries. Milford
Haven can accommodate fully laden vessels of up to 275,000 deadweight
tons on all tides at five private oil company terminals and Finnart on the
Clyde will accept vessels of 325,000 deadweight tons. An offshore mooring
monobuoy, where tankers discharge oil which is carried by pipeline to the
shore, is in operation at Tetney Haven, off the mouth of the Humber, and a
similar buoy has been installed at Amlwch (Gwynedd).
The first purpose-built terminal for oil from the British sector of the North
Development

Sea was completed at Hound Point on the Forth in 1975. Britain’s largest
oil port is planned for Sullom Voe in Shetland, which is expected to become
the biggest oil port in Europe by the 1980s. Other terminals, primarily for
handling oil for export, are being provided on the Tees (where a £29 million
marine terminal with eight jetties is being developed) and at Flotta in Orkney.
Modernisation of the ports industry has been taking place in recent years,
as a result both of the increase in Britain’s trade, especially with other
European countries, and of technological changes affecting sea-going traffic.
The growing size of tankers and bulk carriers has necessitated more deep¬
water berths, while development of mechanical handling methods, packaging
of general cargo, containers and ‘roll-on/roll-off’ services has created a
demand for new types of port facilities.
A major development at Tilbury, Port of London, costing £30 million over
a number of years, has provided 12 deep-water berths, four of them for
container traffic, and a riverside grain terminal. A £16 million container
terminal is to be built at Tilbury for completion in 1978. Another major
scheme has been the construction of the £50 million Royal Seaforth dock
complex at Liverpool which provides ten deep-water berths including four
container berths, a grain terminal and refrigerated meat berth, and two
timber berths. A new dock under construction at Bristol at a cost of some
£37 million will provide six berths and have the largest entrance lock in
Britain; it is due to open in late 1976. Deep-sea container facilities have also
been constructed at Felixstowe, Greenock on the Clyde, Manchester and
Southampton, where new facilities are being built to accommodate the
container service to South Africa, due to start in 1977. At Hull a major exten¬
sion of roll-on/roll-off facilities was completed in 1974. In Northern Ireland
an expansion scheme at Warrenpoint, providing new container and roll-on/
roll-off facilities, was completed in 1975. An £8 million terminal for cross-
Channel hovercraft is to be built at Dover. Modern ore terminals have been
built at Port Talbot, Redcar and Immingham and a £25 million terminal
for handling iron ore and coal is being built at Hunterston on the Clyde.
Construction of an £8 million terminal at Peterhead (Grampian), primarily to
handle fuel oil for the power station which is under construction (see p. 266),
began in 1976.
The exploration for, and production of, offshore oil and gas has led to
several port developments, such as tanker terminals (see p. 312), mainly in
Scotland. Supply bases for offshore vessels have been built at Leith, Dundee,
Montrose, Aberdeen, Peterhead, Lyness (Orkney), and Lerwick and Sand-
wick in Shetland. Three new harbour authorities have been established,
partly to provide for the development of facilities for offshore activities, for
the Cromarty Firth, Orkney and Shetland.
About 65,000 people are employed in Britain’s ports industry; of these,
32,000 dockers responsible for the physical and mechanical handling of
cargo, were registered with the National Dock Labour Board at the end of
1975. The system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past
has gradually been superseded. In 1947 the National Dock Labour Board
was established to administer the Dock Workers Employment Scheme under
which registered dock workers received a minimum wage for attendance
even when no work was available. In 1967 each registered dock worker was
placed in employment on a permanent basis with an employer licensed by
the port authority, under the provisions of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966.
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, nearly 10
per cent is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet, at 33 ^
million gross tons, the third largest in active employment after those of Liberia
and Japan. The oil tanker fleet, at 16-1 million gross tons, is the world’s third
largest, and the ore and bulk carrier fleet, at 8-i million gross tons, the fourth
largest. The British fleet has grown steadily, particularly over the last few
years; since 1970 it has increased by 28 per cent, much of the additional tonnage
consisting of new purpose-built container, tanker and bulk carrier vessels.
Role 0f The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
the Government matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping
Acts it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, for
instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is
not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship con¬
struction; ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and
radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, professional standards,
health and accommodation of seamen. The Acts also contain certain reserve
powers for protecting shipping and trading interests from measures adopted
or proposed by overseas governments. In the offices of the Registrar General
of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record of all British ships is kept.
THE MERCHANT In July 1975, 30’4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
FLEET over were both owned and registered in Britain.2 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 5-2 million gross tons as foreign-going passenger and
cargo liners; 8-4 million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 16 million gross
tons as foreign-going tankers; and 754,000 gross tons in coasting and trade
with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades). Rapid technological
change in the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition. Vessels
are becoming obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being re¬
placed by larger ships, with generally lower building costs per ton. Labour-
saving devices and faster turn-round facilities are helping to combat rising
costs, while shipowners are paying greater attention to operating vessels at
speeds of optimum fuel efficiency following increased fuel costs.
The tendency to greater average size has been most marked in tankers, bulk
carriers and container vessels. Tanker size has increased from a maximum of
about 20,000 deadweight tons in the early i95os nearly 500,000 deadweight
tons for the largest ocean-going tankers. Several combined carriers of over
200,000 deadweight tons are now in operation. The largest modern con¬
tainer ships of up to 60,000 gross tons have a capacity of 2,800 containers of
20-foot (6-metre) equivalent units. The growing use of container and roll-on/
roll-off vessels has resulted in the safer and quicker carriage of a wide range
of goods.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping surveys and classifies ships with particular
regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton = 1
long ton (2,240 lb. or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line. .
2 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary crart, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 315
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned, apart from
some ships which are owned and/or operated by nationalised industries as
part of their normal commercial operations, one example being British Rail
(see p. 308). About two-thirds of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies,
although there are a few independent tanker operators. British liner tonnage
is dominated by a relatively small number of large groups. Some shipowners
have delegated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management
companies. Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly
where heavy investment in ships and facilities is required, as with container
and bulk cargo vessels. Chartering of ships of all nationalities takes place on
the Baltic Exchange, the largest market of its type in the world. The represen¬
tative body for shipowners (excluding, for the most part, owners of fishing
vessels) is the General Council of British Shipping.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, nearly four-fifths by value, is
carried by sea. Ships registered in Britain carry 34 per cent by weight, 45 per
cent by value, of foreign seaborne trade. Tanker cargoes, mostly imports of
crude oil, account for over half seaborne foreign trade by weight but less than
15 per cent by value, and foodstuff's and manufactured goods account for over
four-fifths by value.
The proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by sea is about
one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s. Sea traffic
between Britain and the continent of Europe has increased by over 160 per
cent since the early 1960s, reflecting the growing popularity of motoring
holidays, while the number travelling on routes between Britain and countries
outside Europe and the Mediterranean has fallen by four-fifths, with the
growing competition of air travel.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a
series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates and practices. There are about
100 conferences dealing with trade to and from Britain.
The Department of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of foreign-
going ships, or master and mate of home trade passenger ships and as first-
class engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on
board ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher,
certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Home Office on the results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated an efficient deck hand unless he holds a certifi¬
cate issued by the Department of Trade. To qualify for this certificate he must
be not less than 18 years old, have not less than one year’s sea service and pass
a Department of Trade examination. To become rated as able seaman a
seaman must have served at least three years at sea on deck. Seamen qualify
by seniority and efficiency for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training
for seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National
Conditions of

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sea Training School at Gravesend, Kent, the world’s largest ratings’ establish¬
ment, which trains some 2,000 ratings a year. The Merchant Navy Training
Board promotes the instruction and studies of apprentices, cadets and
ratings who are preparing for their examinations for the various certificates
of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of the majority of seafarers are nego¬
tiated by the National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of
representatives of the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers’
trade unions. Most officers and ratings are registered with the Merchant Navy
Establishment Administration. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are
guaranteed for both officers and ratings. The Merchant Navy Established
Service Scheme, introduced in 1947, removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Under the latest scheme seafarers
are employed either as ‘registered seafarers’ or they may enter into a company
service contract, for a minimum of one year, for employment on the ships of
a particular company. Registered seafarers receive special benefits between
voyages in addition to the normal state benefits. The benefits paid to company
service contract seafarers must be at least equivalent to those paid to registered
seafarers. The industry is studying ways of improving seafaring conditions
of work and leisure.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Coastguard Service, and certain administrative functions concerning
lighthouses and pilotage. The department makes regulations to ensure safety
of navigation at sea and conducts inquiries into shipping casualties and
accidents.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue measures for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 600 regular coastguards and about 8,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
stations and where necessary at a number of others. During 1975 life-saving
action was taken on 4,628 occasions.
The Coastguard Service calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal
National Life-boat Institution, and Service aircraft to assist as necessary. It
can also call upon the services of a long-range civilian helicopter based at
Aberdeen. The Royal National Life-boat Institution is supported entirely by
voluntary contributions, and depends for its operation on voluntary workers.
Lifeboats were launched 2,876 times in 1975 and rescued 1,038 people. In
1975 improvements in Britain’s search and rescue organisation, including a
reorganisation of the Coastguard Service, were begun to meet the growing
number of incidents.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first
Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a board of Elder
Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Lighthouses
in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the Northern
Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These authorities
control about 180 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a number of
lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea marks or by
light towers.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

Pilotage In Britain there are 45 pilotage authorities for the 85 pilotage districts and
over 1,600 licensed pilots. Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority,
licensing some 700 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales, including
London, Southampton and Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour
authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Government intends
to introduce legislation to modernise pilotage operations which will involve
the establishment of a central pilotage board and the extension of compulsory
pilotage to nearly all port areas.
Traffic The first traffic separation scheme adopted by the Inter-Governmental Mari-
Control time Consultative Organisation (IMCO—a United Nations agency with
headquarters in London) was introduced in the Dover Strait, one of the
world’s most congested seaways, on a voluntary basis in 1967. It was revised,
extended and made mandatory for British shipping in 1972, and now stretches
from the Greenwich meridian in the Channel as far as other separation
schemes operating in the southern North Sea. It consists of inshore traffic
zones on each side of the Channel for coastal shipping, and main traffic lanes
in the centre. Britain and France operate radar surveillance services which
keep watch on ships not conforming to the traffic separation scheme and
broadcast navigational information to ships in the Dover Strait. The Anglo-
French Safety of Navigation Group, comprising representatives of British
and French government departments, is responsible for improving safety
in the English Channel.
HOVERCRAFT The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, was invented in Britain and has been in regular public passen¬
ger service around the coasts of Britain since the mid-1960s. Services are
concentrated on cross-Channel routes and on routes across the Solent
between Southampton and the Isle of Wight. Two operators provide cross-
Channel services: British Rail Hovercraft Ltd., a subsidiary of the British
Railways Board, with routes between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and
Calais; and Hoverlloyd Ltd., which has a purpose-built hoverport at Pegwell
Bay for its car and passenger ferries between Ramsgate and Calais. A hover¬
craft crossing takes about one-third of the time taken by ships and hovercraft
have accordingly gained nearly one-third of the short-sea traffic in this area.
Several hovercraft have had or are to have their capacity increased to meet
the growing demand.
CIVIL AVIATION
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of inde¬
pendent airlines. In 1924 four small British companies merged to form
Imperial Airways Limited and this company pioneered the commercial
development of intercontinental air routes. The two public corporations, the
British Overseas Airways Corporation (which took over the undertakings of
Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in 1940) and British
European Airways (established under the Civil Aviation Act 1946), became
divisions of British Airways under the Civil Aviation Act 1971 which created
the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the British Airways Board (BAB).
The new bodies became fully operative in 1972.

Aviation Organisation and other international aviation bodies), airports policy,
amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation security policy and investiga¬
tion of accidents. The Secretary of State appoints the chairman and other
members of the CAA, and issues a written guidance on the general policies
to be followed, which requires approval of both Houses of Parliament.
The Civil Aviation Authority is an independent statutory body, responsible
for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry, the
provision by the National Air Traffic Services of air navigation services and
the aerodrome navigation services at certain British airports and the operation
of eight aerodromes in Scotland. It issues licences and certificates to airlines,
aircraft, aerodromes and personnel, including pilots, air traffic controllers and
maintenance engineers.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering as soon as possible
the whole of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of
its services. Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant to meet
its deficit on revenue account, assessed annually in advance; it amounted
to £60-5 million in 1975-76.
Under the CAA’s air transport licensing system, British operators apply for
licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or variation of
existing licences. The CAA determines categories of licence, content of
applications, and conditions and tariff provisions of licences. With certain
exceptions it is required to license only one British airline to provide scheduled
services on an international route. British Airways is the preferred airline for
all long-haul routes other than those to the areas in the ‘sphere of interest’
of British Caledonian Airways, as defined in the policy guidance of February
1976. In considering applications for licences to provide short-haul inter¬
national or domestic services, the CAA is required to take account of the
effects of the introduction of a new service on the operation of scheduled ser¬
vices by British airlines, particularly the possible diversion of traffic, and, in
general, to license only one British airline on an individual short-haul inter¬
national route, except on a route to and from London. In issuing licences the
CAA must also consider the applicant’s financial resources, staffing and orga¬
nisation, the need for the proposed services, and any representations made by
interested parties. Appeals may be made to the Secretary of State for Trade.
The CAA also licenses air travel organisers. The Airline Users Committee was
established by the CAA in 1973 to assist in protecting the interests of passengers
and other airline users, and to investigate individual complaints against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil ail craft
registered in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and
application of safety requirements concerning airline operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Air¬
worthiness Division is responsible for functions such as the airworthiness
certification of aircraft, the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers, the
approval of work schedules to which transport aircraft are maintained, and
the publication of the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a code
with which all aircraft built in Britain or flown by British airlines must
comply. It has similar duties in relation to hovercraft. The CAA is advised
in these duties by the Airworthiness Requirements Board. A mandatory

system of reporting of incidents and structural or mechanical defects was
introduced in 1976.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is .granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Applicants for professional
pilots’ licences are required to attend approved courses of training before
attempting qualifying examinations and flight tests.
Responsibility for policy planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over Britain and the surrounding seas rests with the National
Air Traffic Services, under the joint control of the Civil Aviation Authority
and the Secretary of State for Defence. Britain is a member of Eurocontrol, a
European international agency set up in 1963, which has responsibilities for
control at the higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft
operating according to civil procedures.
A system of airways, introduced in 1950 and covering the main traffic routes
with control zones around the major airports, has been gradually extended.
The primary navigation aids have been the very high frequency omni¬
directional ranges (VORs) and distance measuring equipment. Re-equipment
with the more accurate Doppler VOR system began in 1974 and should be
completed before 1980. During the last few years virtually the whole of the
airspace over Britain above 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) has been brought under
surveillance by modern primary and secondary radar equipment to provide
data for use in two air traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (Greater
London) and Prestwick. The first stage was introduced at West Drayton in
1971 and in 1975 a subsidiary centre was opened at Manchester. A new
Scottish centre under construction at Prestwick is due to enter service in
the autumn of 1977- Extensive use is being made in these centres of auto¬
matic data processing and other advanced electronic techniques.
The development of all-weather landing systems, on the basis of an im¬
proved version of the standard instrument landing system, was pioneered by
the Royal Aircraft Establishment, airlines and private industry. All Britain’s
major airports are now fitted for use with this improved version. A microwave
landing system is being developed to replace the instrument landing system.
The board of British Airways controls the activities of the seven divisions of
British Airways—British Airways European Division, British Airways Over¬
seas Division, British Airways Regional Division, British Airways Associated
Companies Ltd., British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd., British Airways
Helicopters Ltd. and International Aeradio Ltd. The chairman and members
of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade. British Air¬
ways’ total borrowing limit is fixed at ^5^° million, but may be increased up
to £700 million by statutory order. During the year 1975-76 the board’s turn¬
over was £916 million, and it made a net loss of ^16-3 million. Net overseas
earnings amounted to ^215 million. Revenue earned by the airline divisions
amounted to million. Some 13'8 million passengers were carried on
scheduled services. At March 1976 British Airways employed about 58,200

staff. Its assets of £620 million included £462 million of aircraft and spares and
£92 million of land and buildings.
British Airways has the largest route network in the world, almost 500,000
miles (800,000 kilometres), covering 170 destinations in 80 countries.
The Overseas Division is engaged on long-haul operations. Its scheduled ser¬
vices link Britain with continental Europe, the Middle East, the Far East,
Australasia, East and South Africa, and North America. In January 1976
British Airways inaugurated, jointly with Air France, the world’s first
supersonic passenger services, using Concorde aircraft. Concorde services are
operated by the division between London (Heathrow) and Bahrain, and
Heathrow and Washington. The European Division operates on short-haul
and medium-haul services in Britain and the rest of Europe and to North
Africa and the Middle East. In 1975 it introduced Europe’s first air ‘shuttle’
service (a regular scheduled no-reservation service with back-up aircraft to
carry extra passengers) between Heathrow and Glasgow and a similar service
between Heathrow and Edinburgh started in April 1976. The Regional
Division is responsible for secondary domestic services and for a network of
services to Europe.
British Airways Associated Companies Ltd. is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with some 34 hotel companies and 9 air companies in
different parts of the world. The helicopter division—British Airways Heli¬
copters Ltd.—operates a scheduled service between Penzance, Cornwall, and
the Isles of Scilly, undertakes charter work, provides links between oil rigs in
the North Sea and the mainland and operates air-sea rescue services from
Aberdeen. Engine overhaul work for British Airways and other airlines is
carried out by British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. International Aeradio
Ltd. plans, installs, operates and maintains airport technical services and
general communications and manufactures specialised equipment for use
in these services. Other operations controlled by British Airways include
British Airtours which operates charter flights, British Airways Travel Divi¬
sion which handles sales of passenger tickets in Britain and British Airways
Cargo UK which handles British Airways’ cargo sales in Britain and controls
cargo-handling facilities at 18 airports in Britain.
The British Airways fleet of some 189 aircraft in September 1976 is the world’s
largest passenger fleet operating international services. Aircraft in the Overseas
Division consist of Concordes (2), Super VCios (15), Boeing 707-436S (4),
Boeing 707-3365 (n), Boeing 747s (I9)> an(^ 2 Lockheed TriStars. The Euro¬
pean Division contains BAC One-Elevens (18), Trident Threes (25), Trident
Twos (15), Trident Ones (10) and 5 Lockheed TriStars. British Airways has
converted the Vanguard aircraft into the Merchantman used solely for freight
and five are now in service. The Regional Division s fleet consists of BAC
One-Elevens (7), Viscounts (20), Trident Ones (3) and HS748S (2). British
Airtours has 9 Boeing 707-4365. Helicopters in the helicopter division include
Sikorsky 6iNs (13), Sikorsky 58TS (2), Bell Jet Ranger (1) and Bell 212 (1).
Major orders include three further Concordes, six Boeing 747s and eight
Lockheed TriStars.
Since 1962 more passengers have entered or left Britain by air than by sea.
In 1975 a total of some 30 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) and 15-9 million by sea. British Airways accounts for

some 93 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines. The charter
market is dominated by independent companies; British Caledonian Airways
has 16 per cent of the market, other independent airlines 67 per cent and
British Airways’ charter operations 16 per cent. Total capacity offered on all
services by British airlines amounted to 8,917 million capacity-tonne-
kilometres in 1975.
In 1975 the independent airlines carried some 3 million passengers on
scheduled services. British Caledonian Airways operated a fleet of 29 aircraft
and carried about 1 million scheduled service passengers. Its scheduled services
are primarily to West and Central Africa and South America. Over 240
aircraft operated by some 120 companies are engaged in air-taxi operations
mainly for carrying businessmen. Helicopters are also used to transport
businessmen, but are being employed increasingly in operations connected
with the development of Britain’s offshore oil and gas resources. Light
aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other activities, such as charter
operations, search and rescue services, crop-spraying, aerial survey and
photography, and flying instruction.
The value of overseas trade by air rose by 12 per cent to £6,690 million in
1975 and the proportions of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air amounted
to 17 per cent of the value of exports and 14 per cent of imports. Among
the main commodities exported by air are machinery, medicinal and pharma¬
ceutical products, and diamonds.
The estimated number of aircraft on the British register used for business and
private purposes is 3,000 while approximately 800 are owned by clubs, groups
and training schools. About 20,000 private pilots hold licences and there are
some 10,500 glider pilots.
Of the 118 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, just over one-quarter each
handled more than 100,000 passengers in 1975. Britain’s civil airports
handled a total of 43 million passengers (41’8 million terminal passengers
and 1‘2 million in transit) in 1975. The two major airports in the London
area (Heathrow and Gatwick) handled most passengers, 21’6 million and 5-4
million respectively. Other leading airports were Manchester 27 million
passengers, Luton 1-9 million, Glasgow i-8 million, Belfast 1-2 million,
Birmingham i-i million, Edinburgh 0-9 million and Aberdeen 07 million.
As a result of the increasing use of wide-bodied aircraft, air transport move¬
ment fell by 1-3 per cent in 1975 t° 70I>000> while the number of passengers
carried increased by 4-3 per cent. Freight traffic handled at Britain’s airports
amounted to 638,000 tonnes in 1975.
The Government has initiated a detailed review of airports policy to
consider the alternative ways of handling the predicted increase in traffic
through Britain’s airports. Two documents have been issued, one dealing
with airports in the London area and the other with regional airports, as a
basis for comprehensive consultations with organisations concerned with
airport development.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, was created in 1966. It owns and manages
seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in the south-east, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—which handle
322

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
73 per cent of air passengers and 84 per cent of air cargo traffic in Britain.
In 1975-76 the BAA’s income was ^77-6 million and it recorded a £6-2
million profit after interest and taxation.
Eight small aerodromes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are
controlled by the Civil Aviation Authority and Belfast’s airport (Aldergrove)
is managed by Northern Ireland Airports Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are
controlled by local authorities. All airports and aerodromes in Britain (apart
from those controlled by the Government or by the CAA) must be licensed
annually by the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of adequate
fire-fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable runways, and of air traffic
control services and visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is granted.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at many of Britain s airports. A
major modernisation programme is under way at Heathrow, the world s
busiest centre for international travel, including improvements to passenger
facilities and construction of a station for the Underground railway link.
Gatwick airport, 28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, is the second
major airport for the London area and was the first in the world to bring
together road, rail and air transport connections in one unit. Its capacity will
be increased to about 16 million passengers a year by 1978, when a £70
million redevelopment programme reaches completion.
An extension to Manchester airport, opened in 1974, nearly doubled the
airport’s passenger-handling capacity and enabled it to accommodate large
wide-bodied aircraft. Improvements to facilities at Luton airport will increase
capacity to 4 million passengers a year. Under a ^13 million redevelopment
scheme for Edinburgh airport, a 2,560-metre runway was opened in April
1976 and a new terminal building will be completed in I977’ Construction of
a new terminal is in progress at Aberdeen airport, Britain s fastest developing
civil airport as a result of offshore oil and gas activities, and should be com¬
pleted in 1977. The BAA is undertaking a £10 million modernisation plan
at Glasgow airport. At Sumburgh (Shetland), an important staging post for
communications between the Scottish mainland and many North Sea oil
rigs, a £7 million scheme to improve the runway was completed in 1975.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, public telecommunications,
data processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State
for Industry. It has some 421,000 employees and 23,400 post offices. Income
excluding internal transactions totalled £3,206 million in 1975-76 and a profit
of £148 million was recorded. The Post Office is investing some £4,200
million at March 1976 prices in the period 1975-79; capital expenditure on
fixed assets amounted to £963 million in 1975-76. The Government has set
up a committee to examine the organisation and operations of the Post Office.
Some 170 million parcels and 9,903 million items of other correspondence
(including 9,278 million inland letters) were handled by the Post Office in
I975_7^’> these, 479 million items including 2-6 million parcels were sent
by air.
New highly mechanised sorting office buildings are being opened in Britain.

Postal address coding (postcode) is in operation over the whole country;
17 offices have been equipped with code sorting machinery.
‘Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight collection and delivery service for
computer data and important packages, provides 40,000 services each
week. International datapost services are available to eight overseas countries.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers professional advice on all
aspects of postal business to overseas administrations and work was done in
1975-76 for nine overseas postal administrations.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, a person may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a licence for
his dog, a licence for his television receiving set, renew his motor vehicle
licence, obtain a British visitor’s passport, buy national insurance stamps, and
use the savings and investment facilities of the National Savings Bank (see
p. 362) and the money transmission services of the National Giro (see p. 360).
In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government
departments and local authorities.
Britain has a comprehensive telegram service. Telegrams may be sent any¬
where in the world and are transmitted through the International Telegram
Retransmission Centre in London, one of the world’s largest and most
modern computer-controlled telegram retransmission centres, which has
direct access to terminals in over 80 countries. With the exception of the
small number of foreign telegraph companies licensed to operate in Britain,
all international public telegram services are operated through the provincial
and London offices of the Post Office International Telegraph Service.
The telex service combines the speed of the telephone with the accuracy of the
printed word. The British telex service is fully automatic. Calls may be made
direct between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in Britain (59,000
in March 1976) and also to well over 870,000 subscribers throughout the
world. Britain is linked to some 179 countries by telex and about 98 per cent
of international calls are directly dialled. These include calls to virtually the
whole of Europe. Calls to countries not available through the automatic
service are connected through the International Telex Exchange in London.
The Post Office is planning for a system of about 100,000 British subscribers
by 1982.
The demand for data communications is increasing and the trend is towards
higher speeds. The Post Office offers a range of datel services providing for
transmission at rates of up to no bits per second (bit/s) over telegraph circuits
or up to 2,400 bit/s (to be increased to 4,800 bit/s) over speech circuits. Higher
speeds up to 50,000 bit/s are available over special wideband circuits. Inter¬
national services allow data transmission to the rest of Europe, the United
States and a number of other countries. In 1976 there were 41,300 Post Office
datel terminals in Britain, more than in any other European country. An
experimental packet switched service is being implemented, with packet
exchanges at London, Manchester and Glasgow.
The Post Office operates the largest telephone system in Europe and the third
largest in the world. At the end of March 1976 there were 6,265 l°cal telephone
exchanges and 21-1 million telephones. During 1975-76, 0‘5 million new lines
were installed. Trunk dialling by subscribers (STD) began in Bristol in 1958;
virtually all local and trunk calls can be dialled direct. In 1975-76 some 16,184
324
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
million telephone calls were made comprising 13,736 million local calls, 2,356
million trunk calls and 92 million international calls.
Hull District Council is the only local authority to exercise its option of
operating its own service under licence from the Post Office; this service is
connected to the Post Office trunk network.
The first operational electronic exchange in Europe was opened at Amber-
gate, Derbyshire, in 1966. There are now over 700 such exchanges in Britain.
Mobile electronic exchanges were introduced in 1973 and the first of a new
series of electronic telephone exchanges, with capacities of up to 40,000
lines, was brought into service in Birmingham in February 1976. Pulse code
modulation systems are being used to increase the circuit capacity of lines
on routes between exchanges.
International subscriber dialling operates from London and most other
major cities to 32 countries including most of western Europe and a number
of countries outside Europe. The Post Office is engaged in a five-year pro¬
gramme costing ^250 million to expand Britain s international telephone
exchange network. The Edgware international exchange in London is the
largest of its kind in the world. Calls to Europe are connected via cable and
microwave radio links, and to countries outside Europe by way of trans¬
atlantic and Commonwealth cable networks, communications satellites and
high frequency radio systems.
A radio tower, 620 feet (189 metres) high, in London provides microwave
radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television circuits. There
are about 200 Post Office communications masts and towers in use.
Special Telephone Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the 999
Services emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly
as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade
services. A public radiotelephone service operating in several areas enables
users of vehicles fitted with suitable equipment to make or receive calls to
or from any telephone in the British network. Initial trials are in progress on
‘viewdata’, a service in which a telephone subscriber calls a centre to obtain
information which is displayed on his television screen or on a special screen,
full-scale trials are planned to start in late 1977. Recorded information
services include: the speaking clock, weather forecasts, motoring information,
recipes, cricket scores, binancial Times Share Index and Business News
Summary, and ‘Dial a Disc’. In London a recorded service provides details
in five languages of events taking place, and a similar service, in English only,
is provided in Edinburgh during the summer.
Submarine There are some 25 submarine cable systems between Britain and the continent
Cables of Europe and five between Britain and North America, covering a total of
about 17,800 nautical miles (33,000 kilometres). Cable systems using tran¬
sistors in place of thermionic valves have been developed and refined by
British manufacturers in consultation with the Post Office Research Station
and are used in all new systems. A comprehensive Commonwealth telephone
cable plan, completed by 1967, involved the construction of three long¬
distance telephone cable systems covering a total of 17,3°° nautical miles
(32,100 kilometres). Subsequently there have been large increases in the
capacity of new submarine cables—a cable to France installed in 1976 has
3,400 circuits and one to Belgium, which will be laid in I977> have 4,000
circuits. The Post Office acts as a consultant to overseas administrations
on the installation of submarine cables.

Three aerials at the Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in
Cornwall, which was brought into operation in 1962 and took part in the
first satellite communications experiments, provide commercial telephone
and television circuits via high-capacity geostationary satellites positioned
over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In March 1976 Britain operated some
1,300 satellite telephone circuits to 80 countries.- A new earth station is being
built at Madley (Hereford and Worcester) to accommodate the rapid growth
in international telecommunications; the first aerial should be in service by
1978. The satellites used in the global communications systems are provided
by the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (see p. 406)
in which Britain is the second largest shareholder.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in Britain which provide radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of up to some 500
miles (805 kilometres) and 250 miles (402 kilometres) respectively, and with
oil rigs and pipe-laying barges in the North Sea. There is also the long-distance
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone station, Portishead Radio, which communi¬
cates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations are an important part of the search and rescue services
concerned with safety of life at sea (see p. 316). They broadcast navigational
warnings and weather bulletins, keep continuous watch on the international
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships
or aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1975-76 the stations handled 750 urgency and distress calls.
The stations also exchange radiotelegrams with ships and connect .radio¬
telephone calls between telephone subscribers ashore and suitably equipped
ships. Radio teleprinter facilities are being introduced at selected coast
stations to enable ships to be connected to telex subscribers ashore.
An j£8 million microwave radio system is being developed to link oil and
gas production platforms in the North Sea with the mainland. Two new radio
stations in north-east Scotland and south Shetland entered service in 1976.
The Post Office is one of the largest users of automatic data processing equip¬
ment and techniques in Britain. Its computer organisation has two parts:
the Post Office Data Processing Service for internal services, and the National
Data Processing Service for services to firms and other external users.
The world’s first purpose-built system of conferences by television, ‘Confra¬
vision’, was introduced by the Post Office in 1971. Using Post Office video
circuits the service allows private communication between studios in London,
Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, and Manchester. An experimental inter¬
national Confravision link to Sweden was opened in 1974 and a further
extension to the Netherlands began operating in 1975.
The Post Office is spending some £40 million a year on research and develop¬
ment, in collaboration with industry and the universities. An ^11 million
research centre, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, at Martlesham
Heath, Suffolk, has recently been completed.
16 Employment
Employment policy in general, industrial relations and pay policy are the
responsibility of the Department of Employment, while the Manpower Ser¬
vices Commission is responsible for the public employment and training
services (other than the careers service, see p. 331) and for advising the Govern¬
ment on manpower questions generally. In Northern Ireland employment
matters are the responsibility of the Department of Manpower Services.
Growth in
Working
Population
MANPOWER
The total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1975 was 25'9
million, about 46 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed, the self-
employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working population,
there remained 227 million employees (13-5 million men and 9-2 million
women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those working
part time) in the labour force continues to rise. The great majority of the working
population work for a wage or salary, but nearly 2 million are employers or
self-employed.
The total working population of Northern Ireland, including employers and
self-employed, was 594,000 in June 1975 (380,000 males and 214,000 females).
The number of employees in employment was 494,000. The largest non-service
industries are agriculture, engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agri¬
cultural workers in Northern Ireland are family workers. Farmers and small¬
holders working their own holdings account for about 6 per cent of the working
population.
The working population increased slowly until 1966, and declined between
1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 24). One reason
for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the late 1970s the male labour force is expected to start increasing slowly, while
the number of females is expected to continue to increase.

Distribution of
Manpower
Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, improved
productivity and more training. In general, non-employed married women
form the only substantial reserve.
The distribution of employees both by industry and by sex is shown in the
diagrams below.

Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work; for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, in general, forbids
discrimination against women in opportunities for employment (see p. 335).
Women are chiefly employed in the food, drink and tobacco industries; the
manufacture of electrical goods, textiles and clothing; transport and com¬
munication; the distributive trades; the financial, professional, scientific and
miscellaneous services; and public administration.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
It is estimated that in October 1975 in manufacturing industries in Great
Britain (comparable figures for Northern Ireland are not available) nearly 28
per cent were administrative, technical and clerical employees (the ratio ranged
according to industry from I4‘6 per cent in clothing and footwear to 4°'9 Per
cent in chemicals and allied industries).
As an aid to government manpower policies the Manpower Services Com¬
mission, both independently and through its Employment Service Agency,
maintains a continuing study of manpower resources and requirements both
for the whole economy and for certain industries and occupations. The MSC’s
Training Services Agency also co-operates with industrial training boards on
technical problems connected with industrial and manpower planning, re¬
cruitment, training and careers advice.
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole was among the lowest in
the world during the 20 years prior to 1967—usually between 1 and 2 per cent—
and, although it has risen since then, it was still lower during 1976 than in
several other major industrial countries.
It has been relatively low in the south-east of England, and consistently
higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest dependence on
shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy engineering and
metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland and Wales, and

north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have been the subject of a
series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate industrial expansion; and
counter-measures have been taken to limit expansion in areas of manpower
shortage (see p. 210). The general unemployment rate in Great Britain in July
1976 was 5-4 per cent: the areas with the highest rates were Wales and Scotland
and the north of England.
Since August 1975 the Government has progressively introduced a series of
measures to check the rise in unemployment, to help keep people in jobs and
at the same time to safeguard and expand Britain’s industrial potential so as to
provide the base for more jobs in the medium term. The measures include: a
temporary employment subsidy for firms with good long-term prospects to
suspend redundancies which would otherwise have taken place; a job creation
programme providing temporary employment for those worst hit by high
unemployment—largely young people; a recruitment subsidy for school
leavers; expansion of training programmes; additional funds to encourage the
movement of unemployed workers to areas where jobs are available; and
assistance for industrial investment (see p. 210).
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1976 it was 9-9 per cent of all
employees. The Northern Ireland Department of Commerce has wide powers
(similar to those of the Department of Industry in Great Britain) to assist the
development and diversification of industry. It is using these powers vigorously
in an attempt to improve the situation (see p. 57).
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
In Great Britain the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) runs the public
employment and training services (other than the careers service, see p. 331).
Its responsibilities are exercised through two agencies, the Employment Service
Agency (ESA, see p. 330) and the Training Services Agency (TSA, see p. 333),
both of which are statutory organisations headed by a chief executive appointed
by the MSC with the approval of the Secretary of State for Employment. The
MSC has a chairman and nine other members appointed after consultation with
employers and employees, and local government and educational interests;
responsibility for the management and development of the commission’s
services thus belongs directly to representatives of those who use them.
The MSC carries out its functions within a general policy framework
agreed with the Secretary of State, and was responsible for expenditure of about
£300 million in 1975. Most of its activities are financed from public funds, and
it receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Employment. The
MSC is advised by a network of district manpower committees on which
employers, employees and other local interests are represented, to secure the full
benefit of local knowledge and the co-operation of employers and employees.
The main duty of the MSC is to make such arrangements as it considers
appropriate for assisting people to select, train for, obtain and retain employ¬
ment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable employees. .Its respon¬
sibilities include running the offices of the employment service, Professional
and Executive Recruitment (PER), the Occupational Guidance Units and other
employment services, operating the Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS)
and co-ordinating the activities of the industrial training boards (see p. 333).
The services in Northern Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department
of Manpower Services but there are some variations related to the much smaller
area of administration.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
While many of the employment and training functions of the Secretary of
State have been transferred to the MSC, he retains responsibility for general
manpower policy, manpower aspects of regional policy and regional economic
planning, and for the department’s unit for manpower studies, the race rela¬
tions employment advisory service, certain executive duties under the Race
Relations Act 1968 (see p. 142), certain functions in relation to redundancy
payments, the issue of work permits to immigrants and international aspects of
employment and training matters, and the wages inspectorate. Management
of unemployment benefit has been separated from that of the employment
services and is administered under a regional benefit manager at each of the
department’s regional offices.
The main government employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain through a country-wide network of employment
offices and jobcentres run by the MSC’s Employment Service Agency.
Employment offices provide a comprehensive service for employers needing
staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking jobs.
Information and advice on any employment problem is available to all. Use of
the service is voluntary. Employers and individuals alike remain free to use
general or specialised fee-charging private employment agencies and direct
recruitment by advertisement or personal introduction. There are some 950
local offices, which placed people in some 1,290,000 jobs in i975> some 20 Per
cent of total adult placings in Britain.
The employment offices handle the full range of occupations and deal with
full-time, part-time and temporary vacanciei. Details of unfilled vacancies (or
of people seeking jobs) can be circulated quickly in the travel to work area, or
more widely if necessary.
Employment offices are being gradually replaced by jobcentres which provide
self-service facilities in addition to other services. The first jobcentre was
opened in 1973 and a network of 800 is to be in operation by 1980.
A commercial employment service for office and shop work is available at all
employment offices and also at a number of specialised commercial employment
offices. In the hotel and catering industry a specialist service is based on the
Hotel and Catering Trades Office in London and more than 20 hotel and
catering trades sections of employment offices elsewhere.
The Regular Forces Resettlement Service, in which the ESA and TSA
collaborate with the Ministry of Defence and the voluntary organisations con¬
cerned with former regular servicemen, helps members of the Forces to
achieve a satisfactory transition to civilian life.
A nursing employment service is available at all employment offices pro¬
viding advice and help to people in nursing, midwifery, and related occupations
and to those wishing to enter the profession. At larger offices specially trained
staff provide a point of reference for more difficult cases and the service is
supported by a small team of professional consultants.
In large-scale redundancy situations, teams of officers from local employment
offices visit firms to assist in the redeployment of redundant workers to new jobs
or training.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialised service
for men and women looking for professional, managerial, technical and scientific
appointments (separate divisions deal with executive secretary and overseas
appointments, and salary surveys). Each of its 36 offices is staffed by experi-

enced consultants who can quickly identify job opportunities in any part of the
country by use of a computer-assisted matching and selection system. The
service is free to candidates, while employers are charged a fee on all successful
placings, based on the starting salary. A broadly similar service, free to both
employers and candidates, is operated in Northern Ireland.
Occupational guidance units are situated in 45 centres of population. They are
available free to anybody who wishes to take expert advice before choosing or
changing his occupation.
All local education authorities have a duty to provide a vocational guidance
service for people attending educational institutions and an employment
service for those leaving them (the careers service). In addition these authorities
have powers, which they must exercise as required by the Secretary of State for
Employment, to extend these services to people in their early years in employ¬
ment (see also p. 329). At the same time the ESA offers its services to young
people who have left school and choose to make use of the facilities provided by
the agency.
In Northern Ireland the Youth Employment Service has recently been
absorbed into the Department of Manpower Services, which provides a single
comprehensive guidance and placement service for people of all ages.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled people to
get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving age who
is substantially handicapped. The service is administered by the ESA, while the
careers service operated by local authorities helps young disabled people about
to start their careers.
Vocational guidance and help in finding jobs is given at employment offices
by specialised disablement resettlement officers (DROs) who can arrange for a
course of industrial rehabilitation or training or both. A Register of Disabled
Persons is maintained and all employers of 20 or more persons are required to
employ a quota (3 per cent for all industries, except shipping in respect of the
manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Employment rehabilitation is provided at 26 centres (including one linked
with a medical rehabilitation unit). Attendance at a centre is voluntary and
maintenance allowances are paid. Financial assistance is also given to various
voluntary and other organisations operating approved employment
rehabilitation.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at skillcentres (see
p. 333), educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with the help of the Training Services Agency. Grants are
available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for pro¬
fessional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making company, partly supported by public
funds, provides sheltered employment in 87 factories in Great Britain for about
8,400 registered severely disabled people who are unlikely to obtain work
except under special conditions. (A similar organisation, Ulster Sheltered
Employment Ltd., exists in Northern Ireland.) In 1975 the Department of
Employment was helping local authorities and voluntary organisations with
the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment for over 5,000 severely
disabled people (3,000 sighted and 2,000 blind or partially sighted), of whom
200 were trainees. Advice on matters relating to the employment and training

of disabled people is given by the statutory National Advisory Council on
Employment of Disabled People and its district advisory committees.
As part of the policy of assisting geographical mobility of labour within Britain
to balance resources and demands, the ESA also makes grants and allowances to
help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and acquisition of and removal to a
new home, in specified instances. The grants are available to unemployed
workers moving away from home to take up employment; to key workers
transferred by a firm to a new plant in an assisted area (see p. 208); and to local
unemployed workers recruited to new plants in areas of high unemployment
and sent to the parent works for preliminary training.
The Government offers incentives both to encourage industrial expansion and
reduce unemployment in the assisted areas. The incentives include grants
towards the cost of new buildings and equipment; tax allowances; help with
training; and a regional employment subsidy (see also p. 210).
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p. 11, but excluding
nationals of European Community countries) need a work permit issued by the
Department of Employment. This must be applied for by the prospective
employer and is issued for a specific job and for a fixed initial period not
exceeding 12 months in the first instance. People admitted as holders of work
permits may only change their jobs with the approval of the Department of
Employment. Normally their stay is extended if they remain in approved
employment. After four years’ approved employment the time limit attached to
their stay may be removed and a worker may change employment without
restriction. Permits are in general issued only for work requiring a professional
qualification, skill or experience, where the Department of Employment is
satisfied that the worker is necessary, and where the wages and conditions are
not less favourable than those generally available in the area for similar work.
Subject to an annual quota for both men and women (other than the more
highly skilled), permits may, however, be issued for work in the hotel and
catering industry, hospitals, and resident domestic work. (In the hotel and
catering industry permits for employment as resident domestics are normally
issued to single women and married couples for full-time work in residential
establishments; permits are not issued to single men or to married men or
women either on their own or with children under the age of 16.)
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of
European Community countries) are generally eligible for permits on the same
terms. In addition Commonwealth citizens may be admitted for fixed periods of
training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance if they hold trainee permits issued by
the Department of Employment. Foreign nationals may also enter Britain as
holders of student employee permits for short-term employment to enable them
to improve their English and widen their business experience.
In Northern Ireland employment permits are issued by the Department of
Manpower Services and are required for non-Northern Ireland workers.
Legislation defines Northern Ireland workers and makes certain occupations
exempt.
The European Community regulations, now enforced in Great Britain,
establish the rights of workers to move freely between member States for the
purposes of employment. In Northern Ireland there is a transitional period
extending up to 31st December 1977 before this applies. Workers entering

another member State are entitled to be treated in the same way as nationals of
that State as regards facilities of the national employment services, pay and
working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training and retraining
facilities, access to housing and property, and insurance and industrial injury
benefits. Workers who wish to remain in the United Kingdom for longer than
an initial period of six months are expected to apply to the Home Office for a
residence permit. If they are in permanent employment the residence permit is
valid for five years. If the employment is temporary (that is, for less than a year)
the permit is valid for the expected duration of the employment.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements for
assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in other
member countries.
Race relations employment advisers, based in the Department of Employment’s
regional offices, provide advice and information to employers, trade unions, and
other organisations with the aim of improving employment opportunities for
immigrant workers.
The task of managing and developing the country’s training programme,
expenditure on which is being considerably increased, is the responsibility of
the Training Services Agency (TSA) of the Manpower Services Commission.
Most industrial and commercial training has always been carried out by
individual employers, but in recent years the Government has taken a number
of measures based on the need to provide trained manpower to sustain the
growth of the economy, and to provide opportunities for people to make the best
use of their skills and to acquire new skills when old ones are no longer in demand.
The 23 industrial training boards (and the Foundry Industry Training
Committee), covering some 12 million employees, are responsible for industrial
training in their respective industries.
Exchequer funds are available to cover the boards’ operating expenses,
including advisory services, and for grants for certain key training activities;
the boards have powers to raise levies to finance other training activities,
the levy rate normally being limited to 1 per cent of employers’ payrolls. The
boards’ plans and budgets are agreed with the TSA for a running five-year
period. The TSA is also empowered to promote training for some 10 million
people employed in industries not covered by the statutory industrial training
boards reporting to the MSC, and maintains liaison with all major industrial
training organisations in this sector. The TSA has a duty to ensure that training
in this sector is of adequate standard.
The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to supplement the
training given by industry by providing individuals over the age of 19 with the
opportunity to acquire a skill or to retrain. Training is carried out at some 58
skillcentres (SCs) which are within easy reach of the main industrial areas.
Courses are available in over 60 different trades. Training under the scheme is
also provided in colleges and employers’ establishments. For severely disabled
people training is provided at four residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with government financial assistance. Trainees are paid earnings-
related allowances which vary according to the number of dependants and are
substantially higher than unemployment benefit. The Government is expand¬
ing the scheme substantially. Some 60,000 people were trained under TOPS in
1975 and the number is steadily increasing (it is expected to be 80,000 in 1976).

The Training Within Industry Scheme (TWI) is intended to develop the skills
of supervisors in job relations, instructing and communicating, improving
methods and preventing accidents. Special courses are available for supervisors
employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals. There is also an in-plant
training service to aid selection and further the training of operatives and
clerks as instructors. Courses in international trade procedures are available for
staff employed in export/import offices and (at an advanced level) for customs
training clerks. Courses in industrial instruction techniques are available to
firms and SC staff at the Training Services Agency’s two Instructor Training
Colleges (one in England and one in Scotland) and at six Instructor Training
Units attached to SCs. .
Training services at SCs, TWI courses, and courses at Instructor Training
Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under approved schemes (for
instance, those of the International Labour Organisation or technical assistance
provided jointly by the Department of Employment and the Ministry of
Overseas Development).
Other training services comprise the training of firms own instructors,
training of experienced workers in instructional techniques, provision of mobile
instructors to train people in employers’ own premises, and training of
supervisors.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees and in providing certain legal im¬
munities for trade unions. The determination by statute of minimum wages,
holidays and holiday pay was until recently confined in principle to those
trades and industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both,
was inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to ensure their observance
(see p. 338). However, recent legislation, in particular the Employment Pro¬
tection Act 1975 (see p. 339), provides considerable safeguards for the employee
in his terms of employment as well as working conditions. The Terms and
Conditions of Employment Act 1959, as amended subsequently, provides
machinery, under certain conditions, for enforcing the observance of terms or
conditions established by collective agreement. The Contracts of Employment
Act 1972 requires an employer to give an employee written information on his
terms and conditions of employment, and the procedure available to him
where he has a grievance about his employment; it also lays down the right of
both employers and employees to minimum periods of notice when employ¬
ment is to be terminated. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1965 and l9^9
employees with a minimum period of service of 104 weeks are entitled to
lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease to exist (for example,
because of technological improvements or because of a fall in demand) and their
employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly met from
a fund subscribed to by industry. The Trade Union and Labour Relations
Acts 1974 and 1976 give protection against unfair dismissal by providing
machinery under which an employee may complain against an employer of
unfair dismissal, and obtain reinstatement, re-engagement or compensa¬
tion; give legal support to the right to trade union organisation by making it
unfair to dismiss a person because of his membership or participation in the
activities of an independent trade union; and lay down that written collective
agreements between trade unions and employers are presumed to be intended to
be legally binding only if they contain a provision to that effect. The Employ-
EMPLOYMENT
Wage Rates
and Earnings

335
ment Protection Act 1975 extends the rights of employees regarding unfair
dismissal and penalisation short of dismissal because of trade union member¬
ship or activities, and payment when work is not available for reasons other
than as a result of a trade dispute.
The Race Relations Act 1968 makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate
on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin in the engagement,
dismissal or employment of workers. The Race Relations Bill 1976 includes
proposals designed to strengthen some of its provisions.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes it unlawful, with some limited
exceptions (for example, for employment in a private house), for an employer
to discriminate against women in recruitment or treatment of existing em¬
ployees regarding promotion, training, transfer, dismissal and benefits.
Other legislation prescribes minimum standards of,safety, health and welfare
in most places of employment (see p. 344). However, it is recognised that the
causes of many accidents are not amenable to statutory control. Therefore,
voluntary action taken by employer organisations, often in association with
trade unions, is encouraged.
Minimum rates of pay for many manual workers are determined by national
collective agreements or statutory wages regulation orders. For men these
range from about to £2-00 per hour. Separate rates for men and women
may no longer be specified since the Equal Pay Act 1970 (see below) came
fully into force on 29th December 1975. Many employers pay above the national
minima. Higher rates are also usually paid for shift-work and overtime, and
weekly earnings may be further increased by piecework rates and other incen¬
tive schemes. Piecework rates are of declining importance in a number of
industries, where methods of production tend to dictate the output of a worker.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted every year by the
Department of Employment into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some non-manufacturing industries throughout Britain, the
average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1975 were
£1*37 an hour and £59-50 a week. Full-time women manual workers at the same
date earned an average of £0-92 an hour and £34-19 a week. Women’s earnings
are markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average they work
shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, but also because a
smaller proportion of women do skilled work. The Equal Pay Act 1970 requires
that a woman doing the same or broadly similar work to a man qualifies for
equal pay and conditions of employment.
Between October 1970 and October 1975 the average weekly earnings of
manual workers before tax and national insurance deductions increased by
112 per cent for men and by 144 per cent for women. Part of the increase has
been offset by a rise in retail prices of over 90 per cent and by larger national
insurance contributions and income tax. For trends since 1971 in earnings,
wage rates and retail prices, see the diagram on p. 336.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally by
annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increments, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remuneration.
Starting salaries may be in the range of £2,200 to £2,600 (lower for trainees in
their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of full-time non-manual adult workers in April 1975 were about
£68 for men and £40 for women. On average, salaries more than doubled
between 1970 and 1975.
336
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £8,000 to £ 15,000 a year gross before tax. The
posts with salaries in the range of £15,000 to £30,000 a year include those of
Cabinet Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in
government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily
newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher
Earnings, wage rates, retail prices, wages and
managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. The earnings of a few
persons in business, star entertainers and certain other very successful people
exceed £50,000 a year gross. The range of net incomes in the country as a whole
is, however, reduced by a system of progressive taxation and by provisions for
social security.
A Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth, set up in
July 1975, inquires into, and reports on, such matters concerning the distribu-

tion of personal incomes, both earned and unearned, and wealth as are referred
to it by the Government. The work of the commission forms an integral part of
government policy on industrial relations and collective bargaining and helps
secure a fairer distribution of income and wealth. It works in close co-operation
with other bodies involved.
As civil servants, Ministers of the Crown, Members of Parliament, salaried
magistrates and solicitors, and in most professions women have been paid the
same salary as men for doing the same kind of work for some time. Women in
independent professions are not expected to charge lower fees than men. Equal
pay as between men and women is now enforced in all occupations (see p. 335).
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked by men in manual occupations are usually somewhat longer
than their standard hours; in October 1975 they were 43-6 compared with 37
for women. Men and women in non-manual occupations generally work little
or no overtime, although senior salaried staff may from time to time be required
to work substantial (unpaid) overtime.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act (see p. 345) for
adult women over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment of
women and young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings,
except for young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries
(subject to certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make
exemptions from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the
hours of work of adult men are not restricted by statute.
With few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in industries
covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays of at
least three weeks and over one-half have basic entitlements of more than three
weeks, in addition to public holidays. Non-manual workers generally have
higher entitlements than manual workers. Some agreements, particularly in the
non-manual sector, provide for extended holidays related to length of service, or
status, or both.
Payment is made for public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to
Good Friday and Christmas Day there are public holidays in England and
Wales on New Year’s Day, Easter Monday, the last Monday in May,1 the last
Monday in August, and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day); while
in Scotland, though there are many local variations, there are bank holidays on
New Year’s Day, 2nd January (in the Civil Service, banks and most major
industries but on another additional day elsewhere) and 3rd January if either
the 1 st or 2nd January happens to be a Sunday, the first Monday in May, and
the first Monday in August. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays
and, in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day (17th March) and on 12th
July; the Tuesday after Easter is also a customary holiday for industry and trade.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that at the end of 1971 ii-i million employees were covered by occupational

pension schemes. Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay
schemes (additional or complementary to the State schemes, see p. 123)* A
smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the
statutory minimum (see p. 335). Such benefits are more usual among clerical
and professional employees receiving a standard salary than among manual
workers, who have a chance to increase their pay for example, by working
overtime. Senior members of firms may use a company car and some firms
provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes.
The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which
negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as Members of Parliament, the
judiciary, the armed forces, and doctors and dentists; it also services inquiries
on particular pay structures and related problems.
The structure of labour relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system chiefly rests on the organisation of workers and
employers into trade unions and employers associations. These organisations
discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of employment such as wages, hours
of work and holidays, and other matters affecting people at their work. Whereas
in the past the emphasis has been on formal industry-wide agreements supple¬
mented as necessary by informal local agreements in firms or factories, a
gradual change of attitude and structure has led to increasing emphasis being
placed on agreements at firm and factory level (plant bargaining), though there
have been some important exceptions to this trend, for example in the motor
industry. In some industries, firms and factories, negotiations are conducted by
meetings held when necessary; while in others, joint negotiating councils or
committees have been established on a permanent basis. The scope of the
various joint bodies—from the national joint industrial councils for whole
industries to the works councils and committees in individual workplaces
varies widely, and has frequently been extended to cover such additional
matters as production plans, absenteeism, training, education and welfare (see
below). Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to settle
all questions which are raised, but provision is sometimes made for matters not
so settled to be referred for settlement to independent conciliation or arbitration.
Under the Industry Act 1975 (see p. 206) trade unions may obtain information
concerning the future plans of an enterprise whose contribution to a particular
sector of industry is important to the economy, unless it is considered that this
would be contrary to the national interest or in breach of a statute or trust of
confidence. The Employment Protection Act 1975 (see p. 339) also makes
provision for information needed for collective bargaining purposes to be
disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to certain safeguards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) (see p. 340), the
Trades Union Congress (TUC) (see p. 341) and the nationalised industries
through the National Economic Development Council (see p. 191) on matters
in which employers and workers have a common interest. The operation of
collective bargaining has from time to time been restricted in an attempt to
control inflation (see p. 197).
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend
by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations

in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by
the Social Science Research Council (see p. 391) and the Medical Research
Council (see p. 388). In addition, the Department of Employment’s Work
Research Unit provides information on how particular jobs can be redesigned
to create greater satisfaction, helps industry and others in initiating and
evaluating changes in the content of work, and administers a research pro¬
gramme. Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal with management
problems and provide a service to subscribing firms; professional associations,
linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions of manage¬
ment; and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
independent members. Wages councils publish proposals for minimum
remuneration and holidays with pay and after considering any representations
make orders giving statutory force to such proposals. The Department of
Employment’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and workers to interpret
the provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that they are complied with.
About 3 million workers are covered by such arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are boards for England and Wales and for
Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in agriculture.
On 1 st January 1976 important changes in the role, operation and pro¬
cedure of wages councils were made, designed to encourage the transition from
statutory regulation to voluntary collective bargaining and giving the councils a
greater measure of independence from the Government such as making their
own wages orders and having representative members appointed directly by
employers’ associations and trade unions. The scope of the councils was
widened to enable them to regulate any terms and conditions of employment
in addition to remuneration and holidays, and the Government has power to
convert a wages council into a statutory joint industrial council (SJIC), as a
half-way stage towards full voluntary collective bargaining, where conditions
are thought to be suitable. SJICs function in the same way as wages councils,
except that they have no independent members.
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (see p. 334) defines the status
of trade unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal require¬
ments which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on them in respect
of actions taken in support of a trade dispute, for example, peaceful picketing,
and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally enforceable
unless they specifically provide for this.
The Employment Protection Act 1975 extends the rights of employees in a
number of respects and strengthens voluntary collective bargaining. The Act
placed the ACAS (see p. 342) on a statutory basis, provided for the appointment
of a Certification Officer (see p. 341) and for the setting up of the Central Arbi¬
tration Committee (see p. 343); and established an Employment Appeal Tri¬
bunal to hear appeals concerning decisions of the Certification Officer and of
industrial tribunals (see p. 101). (Industrial tribunals deal, in general, with
complaints from employees on infringements of individual rights under a
number of Acts concerning, for example, redundancy payments, contracts of
employment, equal pay, unfair dismissals and sex discrimination.)

The Confederation

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations, many of
which are wholly or partly concerned with labour matters. The primary aims of
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of
employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety,
health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient
use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may
arise. They may also represent members’ points of view as manufacturers or
traders to the Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional organisations
combined into national federations, while in others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional federations for parts of an industry as well
as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 150 national employers’
organisations, which negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned. Many of these national organisations
belong to the CBI.
The final authority of local or small national organisations may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify
their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting
of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent
questions and co-ordinate the work of committees. Employers’ associations (as
defined in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974) may apply to the
Certification Officer for inclusion in the list of employers’ associations main¬
tained by the officer.
The central body of employers is the CBI, which deals with all matters affecting
the interests of employers and represents them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for instance, in the International
Labour Organisation and in the various institutions of the European Com¬
munity. It is also the British member of UNICE (the organisation of industrial
federations of the European Community). The majority of national employers
organisations and nationalised industries and a large number of individual
companies, both large and small, belong to the CBI. Its representatives or
nominees sit on the National Economic Development Council, on various
government advisory committees, and on other statutory bodies, such as the
Manpower Services Commission, the Health and Safety Commission (see
p. 344) and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. 1 hese have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably as do their traditions and attitudes. Trade
unions started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen
and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
EMPLOYMENT
341
Trades Union
Congress
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and admin¬
istrative workers. Trade unions may be organised either by occupation (for
example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed) or by industry,
that is, they may aim to recruit all employees in an industry whatever their
occupation. Some are based on a combination of both principles.
At the end of 1974 the total membership of British trade unions was about
11-8 million. There were 491 unions, but over 78 per cent of all trade unionists
were in the 25 largest unions, each with a membership of 100,000 or over, while
only O' 6 per cent were in the 255 smallest unions with under 1,000 members each.
The Certification Officer appointed under the Employment Protection Act
1975 is required to maintain a list of trade unions. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers, or between workers and employers7 associations.
Under the Employment Protection Act 1975 and other legislation, certain
rights and privileges are reserved for independent trade unions. A trade union
whose name is entered on the list may apply to the Certification Officer for a
certificate that it is independent, such a certificate being conclusive evidence of
independence.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of
unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual
member there are local branches, covering one or more factories. Members may
attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and conditions of
employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the election of the
union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be
entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on wider issues for
action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organising of members in
individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
managements at the factory or plant, may be done by full-time district officials
of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are chosen by their
fellow members in the place of work to represent them. Trade unions vary in
the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their organisation. Where
two or more unions have members in the same workplace, shop stewards’
committees may be formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved in
official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer
injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs where a
case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case of illness,
accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under the national
insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions. Many trade
unions are affiliated to the Labour Party.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
celebrated its centenary in 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote the interests
of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and social conditions
of working people. Its membership comprises 113 organisations, some of
which are themselves federations of smaller organisations. Together they repre¬
sent about iO'5 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions
which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives
assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries.
342
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council which
represents it between successive Congresses and is responsible for carrying out
Congress decisions, watching economic and social developments, providing
educational and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government
the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The council
is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances,
and uses its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages
of work, as well as official disputes. . .
The TUC as well as many individual unions conduct extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade union¬
ism and principles and practice of industrial relations. . .
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the Govern¬
ment’s eight planning regions (see p. 192), with a further similar body for Wales
known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose function is to
make representations to the Government’s various regional bodies, co-ordinate
the activities of trade unions in the regions and keep them in touch with the
policy of the TUC at national level.
Scotland and Scottish trade unionists have also their own national central body, the Scottish
Northern Ireland Trades Union Congress (STUC) which is similar in constitution and functions
to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes Scottish workers may
affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are in fact affiliated to both
bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the Northern
Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), though the
majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions based in Great
Britain. Almost 90 per cent of Northern Ireland trade unionists are members of
organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority belong to unions which
are also affiliated to the TUC.
TUC-Labour Party The TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee was set up in 1972 after the
Liaison Committee general council of the TUC, the national executive committee of the La our
Party and the parliamentary committee of the Labour Party had agreed to
establish a liaison committee to discuss policies on industrial relations and
management of the economy. In 1973 the committee reached an agreement on
the ‘social contract’ (see p. 193) which was reaffirmed in July 1976'
Advisory, The independent Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
Conciliation was placed on a statutory basis under the Employment Protection Act on 1st
and Arbitration January 1976, and is controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and nine
Service other members experienced in industrial relations, of which three are nomi¬
nated by the CBI, three by the TUC, and three are independent.
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors of industry where this is thought to be helpful, and has
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to
pay regard to agreed procedures in the industry or area of employment con¬
cerned. Of 2,500 disputes referred to the ACAS for conciliation in i975> some
80 per cent were resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.
At the joint request of the parties in dispute, and having regard to the need to

safeguard negotiating procedures, ACAS may appoint single arbitrators or
boards of arbitration to determine differences on the basis of agreed terms of
reference. Alternatively ACAS may refer cases for arbitration to the Central
Arbitration Committee. Some 300 joint requests for such references were made
to ACAS during 1975.
Although ACAS has prime responsibility for intervention in disputes, the
Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry or committee of
investigation into a dispute, whether existing or foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for attempting
conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee rights (such
as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal Pay
Act 1970 and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination
Act 1975).
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed
inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also considers claims by in¬
dependent trade unions that they should be recognised by an employer.
The Central Arbitration Committee has replaced the former Industrial
Arbitration Board as the permanent industrial arbitration body able to resolve
differences arising in disputes where other means have failed.
The committee is called upon to arbitrate on claims made under various Acts,
including the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Employment Protection Act 1975.
It also arbitrates on industrial disputes referred to it by ACAS.
While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus¬
tries are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry,
there are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department are
permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service associations
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p. 63). If there
is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or association may,
subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the Secretary of State for
reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent body
appointed by the Secretary of State by powers under the Industrial Courts Act
1919. Government industrial employees are similarly encouraged to belong to
trade unions and machinery exists for joint consultation. There are four Trades
Joint Councils on which representatives of the Government and the trade
unions sit to consider pay and conditions of employment affecting individual
grades and certain other limited matters. A Joint Co-ordinating Committee, on
which the Government and Trades Joint Councils are represented, deals with
national pay negotiations, conditions of service and other matters of general
application. In the main employing departments there are departmental joint
councils for the discussion of domestic matters. Disputes on wages or condi¬
tions of employment that cannot be resolved by the existing machinery can be
referred to the Central Arbitration Committee.

In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical employees)
which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other matters. There
are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with their
employees; in carrying out these duties they are free to choose suitable arrange¬
ments. Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not usually
members of employers’ associations (although the majority are ‘public sector
members’ of the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but
even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road
transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on wage¬
negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade unions
at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies,
similarly representative, to deal with local implications but not normally to
negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the facilities for
arbitration offered to industry generally by the ACAS, but coalmining and
rail transport have their own special arrangements. Consultation at all levels,
including the workplace, has been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
Though time lost through industrial disputes rose in Britain in the 1960s and
early 1970s, as in many other countries, the situation has improved considerably
since 1972 when the number of working days lost through strikes reached a
peak of nearly 24 million. The figure dropped sharply to 5'9^ rnillion in i975>
the lowest figure since 1968. The number of strikes that occurred during the
first six months of 1976 was the lowest for any corresponding period since I9531
Time lost through strikes is very much less than that lost through sickness,
accidents and absenteeism.
Northern Ireland has a similar, but separate system of industrial relations under
which certain powers and responsibilities devolve upon the Department of
Manpower Services. Industrial relations legislation tabled for 1976 will bring
the province into line with similar legislation enacted in Great Britain since
1974-
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their em¬
ployees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of
care towards each other and also to take care for their own safety. In addition,
minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work
are laid down under a number of statutes; some of these also deal with health
and welfare. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised the
system under which safety and health at work was safeguarded and extended it
to cover everyone at work and to further the protection of the general public
from industrial hazards.
The Health and Safety Commission, whose membership is drawn from both
sides of industry and local authorities, has responsibility for health and safety
at work, formerly held by a number of separate government departments. Its
operational arm is the Health and Safety Executive, consisting largely of the
former government inspectorates covering factories, mines and quarries,
EMPLOYMENT
345
Safety
Regulations
agriculture, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works; the Employment
Medical Advisory Service (see p. 348) and the Safety in Mines Research
Establishment (see p. 256).
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations will be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission. In particular the Act gives inspectors the
power to issue improvement and prohibition notices, which enable them to
require practical improvements to be made within a specified time or to require
preventive measures immediately without first having to obtain a court order.
There are provisions for appeals to industrial tribunals (see p. 340) against
such notices.
About 270,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is enforced
mainly by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
Likewise about 750,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared by the Factory Inspectorate
and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (also part of the new Executive) and
local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the health,
safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the fencing of
machinery; precautions against the exposure of people to toxic gases and dusts;
precautions against fire and special risks; the safe condition of premises; and
cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation. Anyone intending to employ
other people in industrial or commercial premises to which either the Factories
Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act applies has to notify the
enforcing authority of his intention and there is a general duty to report
accidents, as well as a statutory duty to report every accident which is either
fatal or causes more than three days’ incapacity. The Factories Act includes
provisions for the compulsory notification and investigation of certain types of
dangerous occurrence. It also contains provisions for precautions against
dangerous substances and the employment of women and young people.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quarries
under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned with
agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the Agri¬
culture (Safety, Health, and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956; and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the
Agriculture Inspectorate, and the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the
Department of the Environment. (The Railway Employment Inspectorate
performs relevant functions as an agent of the Health and Safety Commission.
Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment and for Scotland.) The Department of Trade is
responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping Acts and for safety in air
transport (most of the powers in respect of airworthiness in fact being delegated
to the Civil Aviation Authority, and the Department of the Environment
is mainly responsible for road and rail transport safety matters (though the
Health and Safety Commission also has certain responsibilities in this con¬
nection). Safety requirements in all other places of work including hotels,

places of entertainment and educational establishments are covered by the
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act or (in respect of their offices and shops) by
the Offices, Shops, and Railway Premises Act. The Health and Safety at Work
etc. Act contains provisions to amend the Fire Precautions Act 1971 t° allow
for the transfer to fire authorities of responsibilities for general fire precautions
and means of escape. The National Radiological Protection Board performs
certain functions on behalf of the Health and Safety Executive.
The Health and Safety Executive is responsible, through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, for granting site licences for nuclear installations.
No commercial installations may be constructed or operated in Britain without
a licence granted by the executive under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965
amended by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Conditions attached to
such licences in the interests of safety are imposed and enforced by the
inspectorate.
The Department of Energy has responsibility for the safety of offshore oil
and gas operations and is preparing a comprehensive code of health and safety
regulations under the provisions of the Mineral W orkings (Offshore Installa¬
tions) Act 1971.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of
standards of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in safety
awareness.
To minimise the hazards which may arise from the use of pesticides, a
voluntary scheme has been established under which pesticides are vetted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Advisory Committee on
Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals (see p. 175) before being marketed. The
committee gives clearance for specific uses, subject to its recommendations on
such matters as safety precautions and labelling being agreed to.
There is also a Safety in Mines Research Establishment (see p. 256) which is
concerned with research into safety aspects of mining and other industries.
The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of voluntary
central organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration
of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its
Factory Inspectorate, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulates expert advice and en¬
courages the appointment of safety officers and the formation of works safety
committees, and maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London,
at which various types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards
are displayed, as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being superseded. The Health and Safety Commission is to
appoint three major advisory committees in addition to the Committee on
Major Hazards set up in January 1975; these include one on toxic substances,
one on dangerous substances and one on medical matters. Proposals have also
been made for the appointment of 18 industry-based committees. The Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety
Council are national bodies concerned with accident prevention and sponsors a
number of local accident prevention groups.

Training is important in accident prevention and the Training Services Agency
provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its TWI scheme (see p. 334).
The industrial training boards usually include specific provisions for safety
training in their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs, mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham, and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems of
guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, nuclear
safety, protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and ex¬
plosions, psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in
particular sectors of industry. A register of research into industrial health and
safety matters has been compiled by the Department of Employment to give
an indication of the scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial
research associations include among their more purely economic research pro¬
jects the improvement of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a direct
bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a statutory
responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal miners,
largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The University of Aston in Birmingham helps to meet the need for academic¬
ally trained safety officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned with
the technical aspects of insurance and forensic work.
Great importance is attached to preventing health hazards at work and previous
legislation relating to factories, mines and quarries and offices has been strength¬
ened and reinforced by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. General
requirements within the Act relate to the manufacture, safe handling and
storage of substances which present a health risk, the maintenance of a healthy
environment, and the provision of adequate arrangements for welfare at work.
More detailed requirements are also prescribed (for example, in the Factories
Act) and relate to matters such as heating, lighting, ventilation, general clean¬
liness, dust and fume control, sanitary accommodation, washing facilities and
first aid. Specific regulations also make detailed requirements for certain
processes associated with health risks (for example, dust in foundries and
mines, and lead processes). Many industrial firms and organisations, as well as
the Health and Safety Executive, supported by extensive laboratory facilities
monitor health hazards to which their employees may be exposed.
Legislation, besides forbidding employment of children under 13 years of age,
forbids the employment of children who have not reached the statutory mini¬
mum school-leaving age (now 16) in any industrial undertaking; of young
people underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women in
factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth (see also pp. 123 and
345). It also limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for young
people (see p. 337). Local authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the

Children and Young Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the Education Acts

their areas.
The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), set up under the Employ¬
ment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 and now part of the Health and Safety
Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical aspects of
employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, doctors and
others. It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazardous occupa¬
tions and surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the Manpower
Services Commission on medical aspects of job placement, rehabilitation and
industrial training and co-operates with school medical officers and careers
officers in helping to solve the employment problems of handicapped school
leavers. The service, headed by the Health and Safety Executive s Director of
Medical Services, has over 100 employment medical advisers based in the
country’s main industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI and other interested
organisations are associated with the work of the service through advisory
committees.
The Occupational Medicine and Hygiene Laboratories of the Health and Safety
Executive at Cricklewood, north London, provide laboratory services and
undertake research in the field of occupational health. Among other things
these laboratories assist EMAS in the analysis of blood and urine samples,
while the Factory Inspectorate also looks to the laboratories as a main source of
laboratory assistance.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medica
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAS.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
over and above the statutory requirements. The big employers, including the
State and the boards of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a
number of smaller factories also provide medical services and in a few cases
have joined together in group medical services.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities.
Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices and
shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland)
1965 and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number
of firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups,
supported by representatives of industry, insurance companies and public
authorities, make a valuable contribution to accident prevention.
17 Finance
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
PUBLIC Public expenditure includes the current and capital expenditures of central
EXPENDITURE Government and local authorities, together with the debt interest, and capital
expenditure of the nationalised industries and other public corporations. Public
expenditure, excluding debt interest, in 1975-76 amounted to about £52,200
million, of which 60 per cent was undertaken by the central Government and
30 per cent by local authorities, the remaining 10 per cent representing
the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and other public
corporations.
The wide range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its
distribution is shown in Table 26.
The social services programmes accounted for about 44 per cent of the total
programmes, whereas defence expenditure accounted for 10 per cent.
Out of the total public expenditure of £57,043 million in 1975-76 some
£34,153 million or 60 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer pay¬
ments to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector
(for example, social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt
interest) made up the balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of
goods and services, transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on
the nation’s resources. The gross sums transferred create a proportionately
lower indirect demand for goods and services because of taxes paid and savings
made by the recipients.
Between 1970-71 and 1976-77 total public expenditure programmes grew
in real terms by about 27 per cent. However, measures were taken in 1976 to
reduce planned spending on programmes for 1977-78 and 1978-79, designed
to prevent the public sector absorbing resources needed for exports and
investment (see p. 193).
Public Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure.
Expenditure The survey, which covers the period five years ahead, is carried out by
Surveys officials in the Treasury and other government departments, under the
direction of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies as a basis for decisions about
the total and the composition of public expenditure. The five-year period
gives the Government the opportunity to plan ahead any necessary changes
without causing wasteful disruption in existing services, and to have regard
to the overall economic outlook when taking decisions.
A report on the survey is prepared in the first half of the year. This is
followed by ministerial consideration of the report. The Government’s
public expenditure plans are published (see Bibliography, p. 469) around the
end of the year. They provide the basis for an annual public expenditure
debate in the House of Commons.
The House of Commons has a Select Committee on Expenditure to consider
public expenditure and its reports provide further information on which
debates on public expenditure can be based. The committee has a number
350
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of sub-committees, one to consider general Government financial control and
the presentation of information about public expenditure, and others con¬
sidering public expenditure in particular areas: defence and external affairs,
education and the arts, social services and employment, trade and industry
and environment. These committees take oral and written evidence from
departmental ministers as well as their officials and can take evidence from
witnesses outside Government.

Estimates Each department submits its estimates of cash requirements to the Treasury
in the December before the financial year beginning on the following 1st
April. Estimates cover central Government’s own expenditure. (Not all
this expenditure is classified as public expenditure—for example, payments to
local authorities. Only when the money is spent by the local authorities is public
expenditure recorded.) After they have been approved by the Treasury, the
Supply Estimates are presented to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see
p. 352) and are approved by Parliament for one year ahead, by means of an
annual Appropriation Act, in July (expenditure to this date from 1st April is
covered by a Vote on Account approved by Parliament before the beginning of
the financial year). ’There are 29 allotted days (known as supply days) in each

session on which the choice of subject for debate rests with the Opposition
and on which estimates can be debated. Broad issues of policy are normally
discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid,
finances most of the Government’s expenditure; its balance is held in the
Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund covers
most of the Government’s domestic lending and borrowing, and is operated
as an official account at the Bank of England. The two funds deal only with
sterling receipts and payments; official dealings in foreign exchange are carried
out by the Exchange Equalisation Account (see p. 359).
Cash limits are being greatly extended in 1976-77 to all public spending
where they can impose greater financial discipline. They are an important
part of the Government’s policy for reducing inflation and will help in fore¬
casting the Government’s financing requirements. About half of public
expenditure is covered by cash limits. Certain services such as social security
payments are excluded because, once policy and rates of payment have been
determined, cash spending in the short term depends on factors outside the
Government’s direct control. Cash limits are also placed on the financial
assistance given to local authorities by central Government and on local
authority capital expenditure except new house building and community
ownership of development land. The estimates of the financing requirements
of the nationalised industries (and the regional water authorities) are being
used as a form of cash limit.
Spending departments and authorities are required to provide within their
cash limits for any increase in costs due to pay and price changes. The cash
limits were published in April 1976 (see Bibliography, p. 469).
The Treasury’s authority is required for any new item of expenditure, for any
increase in expenditure beyond that originally authorised, for any change in
policy which means an increase in expenditure, and for extra-statutory pay¬
ments. This requirement is, however, subject to any delegated authority
which may be given to departments to deal with particular types of expendi¬
ture. Treasury control does not imply final sanction by the Treasury—in the
last resort the decision is taken by the Government as a whole, and carried
out subject to Parliamentary consent.
The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Crown and his
independence of the Executive is secured by specific statutory provisions.
Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he ensures that all
revenues and other public money payable to and from the Consolidated Fund
and the National Loans Fund are duly paid over and that all issues are
authorised by statute, and as Auditor General he audits departmental and
other accounts and, as required by statute, submits his reports on Appro¬
priation Accounts and other accounts to Parliament. For many years and with
the encouragement of the Public Accounts Committee (see below) his
statutory audit functions have been extended to include general financial
administration, cost-effectiveness and cases of apparent waste or extravagance.

THE BUDGET
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The accounts of each department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General upon them are considered by a House of Commons select
committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was established in
1861 to ensure that expenditure was properly incurred in accordance with
the purposes for which it was voted and with the relevant Acts of Parliament.
The committee’s terms of reference are simply that it must examine the
accounts and these terms are widely interpreted. Successive committees have
investigated whether full value has been obtained for the sums spent by
departments and have examined cases in which the administration appears to
have been faulty or negligent. The committee has become a powerful instru¬
ment for the exposure of waste or inefficiency. It embodies its findings in
regular reports and its recommendations are considered by departments and
put into effect, so far as they are accepted, by Treasury instructions. The
Government’s reply to each report is submitted to Parliament in the form
of a Treasury Minute and both documents are debated at the beginning of
the following Parliamentary session.
The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set of proposals made usually once a year in either March or April, for
financing government expenditure. Supplementary budgetary measures may
also be introduced at other times of the year. The proposals are described by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against the background
of a statement of the Government’s past and prospective revenue and expendi¬
ture, and his assessment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic
management, and the Budget speech is normally the main occasion for a
review of general economic policy. The scale of public expenditure and taxa¬
tion has an important influence on the general level of output and distribution
of resources. The Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance
between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the
nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Through taxa¬
tion the Government can exert a considerable influence on the pressure of
demand; its measures can also have a broader influence on the pattern of
demand and the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occa¬
sions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget speech as have financial and
monetary measures not related to the Finance Act, such as changes in exchange
control policies. Such measures, however, are not reflected in the resolutions
or the Finance Act but are applied by the appropriate procedure, that is,
separate legislation, statutory instruments or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at the Chancellor s disposal, and
especially by increasing or reducing the yield of central Government taxes.
The tax changes made necessary by the Budget judgment are enacted in the
FINANCE
Public Sector
Accounts
353
Finance Act. But the Finance Act also provides the annual opportunity for
non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases however (income tax and corporation tax) annual
Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are necessary
to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual taxes. Thus a
Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year is a necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
laws, do not come into effect until the appropriate Act—in this case the
Finance Act—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget,
normally at the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill.
Some changes, however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or
from the start of the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.
This enables the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income
tax for example, either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates
following the passing of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions. Tax
proposals may be made at any time to meet changes in economic circumstances.
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central Government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography, p. 469) which is laid
before the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when
he presents the Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context
of the Budget; the accounts of the public sector for the past financial year
and the one immediately ahead; and the accounts of the central Government
for the same two years. The accounts are designed to assist in assessing the
impact of changes in revenue and public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
Government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public cor¬
porations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central Government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
Central Government borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from
the public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 362) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinan¬
cing maturing issues (conversion loans) or to raise new money (issues for cash).
The capital requirements of the nationalised industries are met to some
extent by the central Government through the National Loans Fund, while
those of the local authorities are met partly by the central Government
through the Public Works Loan Board and partly by borrowing directly from
the public. Some nationalised industries and local authorities also borrow,
under special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign curren¬
cies. The euro-currency market has become an increasingly important source
of public sector borrowing. After allowing for the changes introduced by the
Budget of April 1976 the central Government’s borrowing requirement for
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
JQ76-77 was expected to be £10,426 million, compared with £8,820 million in
1975-76 and that for the public sector as a whole £11,962 million compared
with £10,773 million in 1975-76. (In July 1976 it was announced that the
public sector borrowing requirement for 1976-77 was expected to be £11,500
million.) .
Table 27 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources in 1975-70
and 1976-77 together with the effects of the Budget changes (for the changes
introduced by the 1976 Budget, see p. 193).
SOURCES OF The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
REVENUE include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which in¬
clude capital transfer tax and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expenditure
(including taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets) these include
protective and revenue duties, value added tax (VAT), local rates (see p. 69),
stamp duties and licence duties (for example, on motor vehicles). Taxes on
individual (but not corporate) incomes are progressive in that large incomes
bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of Inland Revenue
assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties;
the Board of Customs and Excise collects the most important taxes on
expenditure (the customs and excise duties and VAT) while a variety of
authorities is responsible for the collection of the remainder.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April. The
rates of tax introduced in the April 1976 Budget are as follows: the basic rate
of 35 per cent applies to the first £5,000 of taxable income (that is, total
income less deductions and personal allowances), a rate of 40 per cent is
charged on the £5,ooi-£5,5oo band of taxable income, and the rate for
successive bands rises generally in steps of 5 per cent until a maximum rate of
83 per cent is reached at a level of over £20,000 of taxable income. These
rates are charged on both earned and investment incomes. Investment in¬
comes are also liable to a surcharge on the amount by which they exceed
£1,000 (£1,500 for the elderly); the surcharge is 10 per cent on the first
£1,000 (£500 for the elderly) of investment income above the relevant thresh¬
old and 15 per cent on the remainder. The tax imposed on an individual is
graduated by means of personal allowances and reliefs. In general, married
couples receive higher allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may
choose to have the wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that
the former receives the single instead of the married personal allowance. But
even then the married couple are taxed jointly on their investment income.
For 1976-77 a single person earning £3,000 a year pays £79275 in income
tax, while a married man with the same earned income pays £6']0'2^; if he has
two children under the age of 11 and his earnings plus the family allowance
total £3,000 his tax falls to £478-45. The amount of tax payable by a single
person varies from, for example, £442-75 on an earned income of £2,000 a year
to £10,948-75 on an earned income of £20,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE ( Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. Interest on certain United Kingdom government securities
belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt.

distribution in respect of which the advance payment was made is entitled to a
tax credit, which satisfies the liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for the financial year 1975 (1st April 1975-3151 March 1976)
it is 52 per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent for small companies (as
defined in the Finance Acts 1972, 1974 and 1976). The tax is assessed on the
profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the financial
vear in which the accounting period falls. Where an accounting period
straddles 31st March the profits are apportioned on a time basis. Relief for
the effect of inflation on the value of stocks was given in the November 1974
Budget and further extended in those of April 1975 and April 1976.
Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax of 45 per cent
(deducted in computing profits for corporation tax) is charged on profits from
the winning, as opposed to refining or other form of processing, of hydro¬
carbons under licence in Britain and on its continental shelf. Each licensee
of an oilfield is to be charged on the profits for that field, computed for half-
yearly periods.
A comprehensive tax, capital transfer tax, applies to transfer of personal
wealth in three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers
relating to settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is
chargeable in respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a
cumulative basis. The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property
‘passing’ on an assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased s estate immedi¬
ately before the death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on
successive slices of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower
scale of tax for lifetime transfers than for transfers on death. Under both scales
the first £15,000 of transfers is exempt; the rates on the remainder rise from
5 per cent on the slice between £15,000 and £20,000 to 75 per cent on t e
excess over £2 million for lifetime transfers and from 10 per cent on the
slice between £15,000 and £20,000 to 75 per cent on the excess over £2
million for transfers on death.
Capital Gains Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
Tax or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally 30
per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their circum¬
stances. Certain assets may be exempt from tax, including the principa
private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any chattels, except
those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of less than 50
years), private motor cars, and National Savings Certificates. An individual
is exempt from capital gains tax where the total proceeds of disposals do not
exceed £1,000 in any year. In addition gains on gilt-edged securities are
exempt from the tax if the securities were held for more than 12 months.
Development Land The Development Land Tax Act 1976 introduced a development land tax
jax (DLT) on development value in place of the charge on development gains
and on first letting introduced in the Finance Act 1974. The rate of DLT is
80 per cent but the first £10,000 of development value realised in any financial
year is completely exempt and for a transitional period up to 31st March 1979
the next £150,000 in any financial year will be liable at a rate of 66-6 per cent.
Exemptions from DLT include the sale or development of owner-occupied
residences.

In March 1974 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Govern¬
ment’s intention to introduce an annual tax on wealth, but only after a
thorough public discussion of its form, rates and relationship with other forms
of taxation had taken place. A consultative dpcument was published in
August 1974 and a Select Committee of the House of Commons has examined
the Government’s proposals. The committee’s report was published in
December 1975.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely VAT, car tax and the duties on
tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and
gaming and other revenue duties of customs and excise. These taxes are
usually referred to as indirect taxes since they are normally paid by the
importer, manufacturer, or wholesaler, who adjusts the prices charged to
customers accordingly. On 1st January 1976 customs revenue duties were
converted into internal taxes (except in the case of tobacco, which is to be
completed by 1st January 1978). Prior to this it had been the practice in
Britain that a commodity taxed to provide revenue bore a customs duty if
it was imported and an excise duty if it was domestically produced. How¬
ever, under the Treaty of Accession to the European Community Britain
undertook gradually to convert revenue duties into internal taxes chargeable
alike on imported and home-produced goods. Following the conversion
fiscal charges, known as excise duties, are charged on imported goods at the
same rates as the duties on similar home-produced goods and any protective
charges are levied as import duties under the Import Duties Act 1958.
Import duties are being brought into line with the Community’s common
external tariff (see p. 374)- All the revenue duty goods (other than hydro¬
carbon oil) are subject to the standard rate of VAT.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary between Budgets the
\ AT rates by up to 25 per cent, and the rate of any of the other main groups of
customs and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil and the minor
revenue duties) by up to 10 per cent. This power, known as the ‘regulator’,
requires annual renewal. The April 1976 Budget increased the duties on hydro¬
carbon oil, tobacco products, spirits, wine and beer and introduced a new
duty on cider and perry.
Tax \ alue added tax (\ AT) is collected at each stage in the production and distri¬
bution process. The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person
(generally, a trader carrying on a business with a turnover of more than
£5,000 a year) is charged by suppliers of goods and services with VAT
(‘input’ tax). The trader then charges the customer with VAT on goods and
sendees supplied (‘output’ tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the
difference between output and input tax. Although VAT falls on imported
goods, most exports are zero-rated and VAT entering directly into export
costs can be reclaimed.
^ AT is a broadly based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except
where there are strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There aie
two basic methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief
from \ AT: zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a
customer, but can reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption,
when a trader does not have to charge a customer any output tax but is not
entitled to deduct or reclaim any input tax relating to the goods or services
which he sells. The most important supplies to which zero-rating applies are

most types of food (except in the course of catering); books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for road use); construction
of buildings; exports (goods and most services); public transport fares; young
children’s clothing and footwear; and drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription. Exemption applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal
services, betting, gaming other than by means of a gaming machine and
lotteries, finance, education, health and burial and cremation.
VAT is chargeable at a standard rate of 8 per cent except for certain goods
which are charged at a higher rate of 12-5 per cent. These include petrol, most
domestic electric appliances (excluding cookers, space heaters and fitted
water heaters), radios, televisions, hi-fi equipment, boats, aircraft, caravans,
cameras, binoculars, furs and jewellery.
New cars and motor caravans, whether British made or imported, are charge¬
able with car tax at 10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the
price including car tax.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 7-5 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is
charged at 4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
The annual tax on motor vehicles is collected by the Department of the
Environment; the proceeds are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The licence
duty on a private motor car is £40 a year; motor cycles and three-wheel
vehicles, etc., pay £4, £8 or £16 a year according to engine capacity. Goods
vehicles are taxed by unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The National The National Debt increased rapidly during and immediately after the first
Debt and second world wars. It rose from £650 million in 1914 to £7,435 million at
the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in 1939 to £23,647
million in 1946. On 31st March 1976 the total National Debt was estimated at
£56,577 million, of which £3,444 million (valued at the rate of £i=:$i-9i6o)
was repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States
and Canadian Governments. Of the £53>I33 m^on °f interna^ debt, £11,994
million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills,
while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans and cer¬
tificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2o to 134 per cent) and
with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
PUBLIC FINANCE
IN NORTHERN
IRELAND
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole. The
major sources of revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of
the yield of United Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of
the United Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues
from local resources such as the regional rate and from certain non-tax
revenue. This revenue is supplemented by an annual sum voted to the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Loans from the United Kingdom
National Loans Fund are available (up to a limit of £800 million) to finance
capital expenditure programmes in Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to

THE BANKING
SYSTEM

statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being those
relating to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a
pool of money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on
31st March 1976 a sum of approximately £476 million was outstanding
against such borrowers.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services; the British offices of domestic and
overseas banks whose main business is in other countries; merchant banks
and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank, the
Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
deposit banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system; it is the
note-issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised
industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth government
stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank administers exchange control.
On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange Equalisation Account
(EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign exchange and
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International Monetary Fund. Using
the resources of the EEA the Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange
market both to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling
and to conserve the means of making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently the
Bank has a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formula¬
tion of monetary policy and for its subsequent execution.
The Bank’s implementation of monetary policy is carried out through
market operations and its arrangements to call for or release special deposits
from or to banks and the larger finance houses. The techniques for controlling
credit involve reliance among other things on changes in interest rates which
the Bank can influence by buying or selling Treasury and other bills in the
market and by similar operations in the market for government stocks. An
important indication of its intentions is the minimum lending rate (known as
‘Bank rate’ until 1972), which is the minimum rate at which the Bank will
normally lend to the members of the London Discount Market and closely
reflects short-term market rates, being normally | per cent above the average
rate of discount for Treasury bills. Calls for special deposits also influence
interest rates and restrict the growth of money supply by reducing the banks’
lending base. In order to facilitate the regulation of monetary policy the Bank
requires banks to maintain a minimum reserve asset ratio of 12-5 per cent
eligible liabilities (basically sterling deposits of two years or less from outside
the banking system together with any foreign currency changed into sterling).
The Bank is the recognised channel of communication between the deposit
banks and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one hand,
and the Government on the other.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
360 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish clearing and
Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart
from an amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered
by holdings of Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation
is the responsibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
The Deposit The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash-
Banks ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London
and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also
operate in Northern Ireland.
In April 1976 sterling sight and time deposits with these banks from non¬
bank customers amounted to £24,700 million and accounted for over 70
per cent of the total of such deposits with all banks in Britain, that is including
the accepting houses, overseas banks and other British banks. The deposit
banks provide full banking services throughout Britain, and operate through
some 14,000 branches. Several of them have interests in British overseas and
Commonwealth banks, and in other banks which have been formed specially
to compete in international markets. They have also acquired substantial
interests in hire-purchase finance houses, and some have set up their own
unit trusts.
Membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House, which has consisted
of the London clearing banks together with the Bank of England, was
extended towards the end of 1975 when the Co-operative Bank and the
Central Trustee Savings Bank also became members. In 1975 cheques,
drafts, bills and bankers’ effects passing through the interbank debit clearing
system averaged in value nearly £I49»^55 million monthly, while the average
monthly value of the credit transfer clearing was over £1,840 million.
Current account balances with the deposit banks are repayable on demand
and no interest is paid on them, but on deposit account balances interest is
paid at a rate below individual banks’ base rates. The deposit banks’ more
liquid assets consist of cash, balances at the Bank of England, money at call
(mainly loans to discount houses), and their holdings of Treasury and com¬
mercial bills. The banks also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
(mainly British Government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or
without collateral security). In April 1976 advances by the London clearing
banks amounted to about 60 per cent of their total deposits.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting system, by
which a creditor with the prior approval of the debtor may claim money due
to him direct from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the
money transmission services. Some banks have automatic cash dispensing
machines in operation. Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement
of accounts in retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash
a cheque up to £30 at any office of the major British and Irish banks, and at
offices of many banks overseas.

through most post offices in Britain. All accounts and transactions are main¬
tained by means of a computer complex at the National Giro Centre near
Liverpool. In March 1976, Giro had 500,000 accounts with deposits of over
£150 million. The number of weekly transactions had risen from i-6 million
in March 1969 to 4-8 million by March 1976 when the weekly turnover
was £700 million. In addition to its services to individuals Giro’s services to
commerce, industry and the public utilities include a facility whereby organi¬
sations with dispersed branches, depots and representatives can rapidly
channel receipts into their central accounting system. Over 120 local authori¬
ties as well as voluntary housing associations use Giro’s rent collection
services. Giro’s international services also provide money transfer facilities in
Europe linking over 16 million account holders in the European Com¬
munity and other countries in Western Europe. Giro has been authorised to
offer a wider range of facilities including personal loans and overdrafts, as
well as overdrafts for corporate customers. These new facilities are being
introduced’on a phased basis.
Altogether over 330 overseas banks are represented in London, about 240
directly and 90 indirectly through their holding of stakes in London con¬
sortium banks; of those directly represented, 57 are from the United States,
23 from Japan and 86 from Europe, of which 35 are from the European
Community. They provide a comprehensive banking service in many parts
of the world and engage in the financing of trade not only between Britain
and other countries but also between third countries.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with
acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in international finance and the short-term capital
markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Money or Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of
London. Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mecha¬
nism designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market
consists of 11 discount houses, five money traders and two discount brokers,
all of which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and lend for somewhat
longer periods. They have recourse to the Bank of England as lender of last
resort and the Bank lends to the houses generally overnight or for seven days
at minimum lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate. Most of the
market’s borrowed funds come from the banks, which are thus provided
with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds which they have at
any given time.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer-
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from, and imports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or guaranteed by
a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by
a discount house.

cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
of deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The market accepts as
an informal responsibility that it should cover the Government’s need to
borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread invest¬
ment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings Bank
(see p. 263) and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the
National Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committees consist of representatives
of the voluntary savings movement in the regions and of various national
institutions connected with finance, industry and education. Voluntary local
savings committees, often supported by local authorities, co-ordinate the work
of voluntary local savings groups. The administration of the National Savings
Bank and other forms of national savings is carried out by the Department for
National Savings. At the end of June 1976 National Savings totalled £11,867
million.
Five forms of National Savings securities are on sale: National Savings Certifi¬
cates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds, National Savings
Stamps (to be withdrawn from sale on 31st December 1976) and Gift Tokens.
National Savings Certificates, in units of £1, are encashable at par at any
time; interest, which is free of income tax and capital gains tax, is paid only
on encashment; the limit on individual holdings is 1,000 units of the current
‘fourteenth issue’ introduced in 1974. Index-linked National Savings Certifi¬
cates, Retirement Issue, introduced in 1975, are available only to men aged
65 and over and women aged 60 and over at £10 for one unit certificate.
Interest does not accrue periodically but instead, subject to the certificate
being held for one year, the repayment value is related to the movement of
the general index of retail prices. If held for five years a bonus of 4 per cent
of the purchase price will be added to the repayment value. Any gain is free
of income tax or capital gains tax. The maximum holding is 50 units (£500).
British Savings Bonds, 8-5 per cent, sold in units of £5, are repayable at
par on one month’s notice. If the bonds are held to maturity (five years from
the date of purchase) they are repaid with a bonus of 4 per cent tax free.
Maximum holding is £10,000. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1
(minimum purchase is £5) and individual holdings are limited to £2,000.
After a qualifying period of three months the bonds give investors a chance
to win tax-free prizes instead of receiving interest. There is a weekly draw
for a prize of £50,000 and 25 prizes of £1,000 and a monthly draw for prizes
ranging from £25 to £100,000. At the end of June 1976, £1,153 million was
invested in this form of savings. A selection of British Government securities
is held on the National Savings Stock Register. Trustee Savings Banks also
deal in stock on the National Savings Stock Register.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates and Ulster
Development Bonds on similar terms to the corresponding National Savings
Certificates and British Savings Bonds.
An index-linked contractual savings scheme was introduced in 1975 under
the terms of the Third Issue of the Save as You Earn (SAVE) scheme. The
scheme enables savings to be made in fixed regular monthly amounts with a
minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20 in deposits with the Department for

National Savings, by means of deductions from pay or by other regular
payments. Indexation only applies to completed savings contracts, except
where the saver dies before completing the contract. At the end of five years,
the repayment value will be the total contributions plus any increase due to
index-linking of monthly contributions. Completed savings which are not
withdrawn will qualify for fresh index-linking and a bonus equal to two
monthly contributions at the end of seven years. Savers who wish to stop
payments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be
partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will then be paid at the
rate of six per cent a year on amounts withdrawn after the first year.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings and has about 21 million active accounts. Ordinary
Accounts bear interest at 4 per cent and the first £40 of annual interest is tax
free. Up to £30 can be withdrawn on demand at any savings bank post office,
but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The money is lodged
with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested in government
securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest may be made in Investment
Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee. At the end of June 1976
the sum of the two accounts totalled £2,185 million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, most of which were founded in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject, under the Trustee
Savings Banks Act 1976, to the supervision of the Trustee Savings Banks
Central Board and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Following a planned
programme of amalgamations, there were 21 individual banks in June 1976
(compared with 67 a year earlier) with 1,599 offices, 14 million accounts and
total deposits in excess of £4,000 million. The 1976 Act empowered Trustee
Savings Banks to provide a full banking service including credit sendees and
removed the requirement that deposits be invested with the National Debt
Commissioners. The Trustee Savings Banks operate their own unit trust and
units may be purchased by depositors and non-depositors alike.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include finance corporations, hire-purchase finance com¬
panies, the stock exchange, investment trust companies, unit trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in
the main highly specialised, for example, finance houses, stockbrokers,
insurers and insurance underwriters and brokers.
There are about 1,840 firms engaged in the financing of hire-purchase and
other instalment credit transactions, and of these 38 constitute the Finance
Houses Association which accounts for about 90 per cent of all finance house
business. At the end of March 1976 the value of instalment credit debt
outstanding to finance houses, including those recognised as banks, amounted
to £1,425 million, compared with about £845 million at the end of 1970.
Hire-purchase agreements and other instalment credit comprise about 50
per cent of the total selected assets of finance houses (that is excluding fixed
assets). About 60 per cent of new credit extended by finance houses relates to
cars and commercial vehicles, the remainder relating to industrial and
building equipment and household and other goods.
Since 1965 the leading finance houses have complied with the authorities’
364 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
policies on lending similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses
are required to observe term controls affecting the minimum deposit and
maximum repayment period for specific goods financed by certain forms of
lending. Finance houses with total eligible liabilities exceeding £5 million, are
subject to the same system of credit control as that applied to banks (see p. 359).
Finance Finance for Industry Ltd. (FFI) was formed in 1973 as a result of the merger
Corporations of the Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial and Commercial
Finance Corporation. It provides capital for the re-equipment and develop¬
ment of industry when finance cannot readily be obtained elsewhere; and
provides capital, financial advice and computer and other services to small
and medium-sized companies, especially those concerned in technical
development. The resources of the company have been expanded substan¬
tially to enable it to provide up to ^1,000 million of medium-term funds at
commercial rates of interest for investment in industry. At the end of April 1976
loans to 28 companies amounting to just over £200 million had been approved,
of which £ 100 million had been advanced.
Equity Capital for Industry Ltd. (ECI) was formed in mid-1976 as a new
specialist long-term institution whose primary purpose is to provide equity
or equity-type capital for industry in Britain which cannot appropriately
be provided through the normal market mechanism. Its authorised capital is
£50 million and the shares are largely held by insurance companies and life
offices, investment trust companies, unit trusts and FFI. There is an
unauthorised unit trust associated with ECI whose units are held by pension
funds so as to enable them to participate in the provision of capital.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14-2 million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (j£o-io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and 1 if million ‘B’ ordinary
shares of £1 (^o-5o paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central
banks in the Commonwealth. At 31st March 1976 the CDFC held investments
of about £35 million spread over a wide range of industries in 40 countries.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1-5 million
and at 31st March 1976 loans and investments amounted to £300 million.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1975
CDC had a total capital commitment of £268 million.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment. At the end of i975> such companies held assets
worth £5,703 million, of which over one-third were in overseas securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company

and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a half-
yearly service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the trust deed meets the Department’s requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at ^80 million. At the end of July 1976 there
were 2-2 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised
trusts depends on the value of the underlying securities; from only £60
million at the end of 1958 they had risen to £2,544' million at the end of
July 1976. There is a wide variety of trusts, both in the range of investments
covered and in the ways of catering for the differing needs of investors.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and indus¬
trial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly
from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of
share capital is not fixed; shares are not dealt in on the stock exchange but
may be withdrawn at par in cash if notice is given. The Building Societies Act
1962, which consolidated all earlier legislation, prescribes the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few
large societies. At the end of 1975, 382 societies were registered, with total
assets of about £24,200 million; just over half of this amount is accounted for
by the five largest societies. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1975 was
£4,900 million, 67 per cent more than in 1974.
The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
on 25th March 1973. Dealings with the public remain unchanged, but brokers
may open offices nationally and firms wherever situated trade on equal terms.
The main exchange and central administration are in London. There are
also trading floors in Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol,
Cardiff, Belfast and Dublin.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the Stock Exchange
are greater than in any other market in the world and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European bourses combined.
Some 9,000 securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange; at the end of
March 1976 these had a total market value of £250,000 million. About
7,500 securities of companies were quoted, including a number of leading
overseas companies. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the
securities at market valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom, Irish
Republic and other overseas government and corporation stocks.
The Stock Exchange does not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bar¬
gains are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The market consists of about 250 authorised banks and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their trans¬
actions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
determine in advance the precise sterling equivalent of the foreign currency.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all transactions which
customers ask to have executed at the fixing. Although much interest centres
upon the fixings, active dealing takes place throughout the day. The London
fixing price remains the basis on which most of the world’s non-monetary gold
is traded. Forward prices may also be quoted on request.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or
joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 800 insurance companies authorised to carry on one or more
classes of insurance business in Britain of which about 170 are overseas
companies. A number of other overseas insurance companies are represented
by agents in Britain although they do not write business here.
Some 300 companies belong to the British Insurance Association and these
account for about 95 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
’Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. Although in its earlier history the activities of
Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance business, there
has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market for
the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine, aviation
and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871.
The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The society does not accept insurance itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth underwriters have been admitted to
membership of Lloyd’s if they satisfy the requirements.
There are some 8,500 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
Insurance Brokers

Insurance Services
Commodity
Markets
The Crown
Agents
FINANCE 367
nearly 360 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
Alongside its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a world-wide
organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa¬
tives of the latter.
Over 60 per cent of the general (that is, non-life) business of members of the
British Insurance Association is carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance
on the London market and partly through branches and agencies established
in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business is
that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available
for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and re-insurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of the directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a ‘common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. Two directives have
been approved by the Council of Ministers. The first deals with the conditions
of access to non-life insurance business and the second requires member
countries not to discriminate in law or practice between their own subjects
and those of other member states. Draft directives on life insurance, insurance
contracts, and the taxation of insurance policies are also being considered.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these physical markets in the City
of London. There are also a number of active futures markets including the
Baltic Exchange (grains), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee,
rubber, soya bean meal, sugar and wool) and the London Metal Exchange
(non-ferrous metals, including silver).
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for some 100 governments,
mostly of independent countries, and over 200 overseas public authorities
and international bodies. The individual Crown Agents are appointed by
the Minister for Overseas Development, but the office is not a government
department. It is a non-profit-making public service which is responsible
to its principals for business operation. In April 1976 the Government
announced its intention to incorporate the Crown Agents.
18 Trade and
Payments
PATTERN OF
TRADE
Value and
Volume
Although small in area and accounting for only about i -4 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s biggest trading area
which accounts for over 35 per cent of all trade.
Since the mid-nineteenth century, when the rapid growth of Britain’s
industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by its development as an
international trading centre, overseas trade has been of vital importance to the
country’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for almost half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs, and most of the raw materials needed for its industries.
It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs, timber and paper, metals
and ores, and other raw materials, petroleum and many other products. Its
exports of goods represent more than one-fifth of the gross domestic product. It
is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures,
electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles.
The existence of a sound commercial banking system and a wide range of
financial institutions ensures that commercial needs are met for both short-
and long-term finance for international trade. The facilities provided by mer¬
chant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance
shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas
countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of British overseas trade including its
commodity and area distribution, outlines British commercial policies and
government services to overseas trade, summarises the balance of payments and
gives an account of government aid to developing countries.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1975 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about ^18,768 million f.o.b.
on a balance of payments basis. On the same basis, after excluding payment for
freight and insurance and making some other adjustments, imports in 1975
were about £21,972 million. Between 1974 and 1975 the value of exports rose
by 18 per cent while that of imports increased by only 4 per cent. Over the same
period the volume index of exports declined by 4 per cent and of imports by
7 per cent; but the unit value of exports rose by 22 per cent and of imports by
only 13 per cent. These movements occurred against a background of a low
level of domestic activity, higher commodity prices and a further depreciation
of sterling (see p. 197).
The value and volume of exports and imports, together with the terms of
trade index, from 1970 to 1975 are shown in Table 28.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products amounted to about 17 per
cent of the total value of imports during 1975, when their value was £4,168
million. This was 8 per cent lower than in 1974 due to a reduction in volume
following the increase in the price of crude oil which by the end of 1975 had
risen to five times the level in the third quarter of 1973.
In recent years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in other in¬
dustrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufactures.

Such imports rose from about 6 per cent of the total imports in 1957 to 24 per
cent in 1974, and to 26 per cent in 1975, when they were valued at £6,395
million. Imports of semi-manufactures have also been increasing and since
1962 have formed a larger part of the total import bill than basic materials,
partly because the countries producing the basic materials increasingly carry
out the subsequent stages of manufacture themselves. Imports of semi¬
manufactured goods (including chemicals) totalled £6,150 million in 1975 and
accounted for 25 per cent of total imports.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS

Trade
371
About 83 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group is machinery
and transport equipment, exports of which have been increasing rapidly and
accounted for 41 per cent of total exports in 1975. The share of chemicals has
grown fairly steadily, but dropped slightly in 1975. However, exports of
machinery alone rose from 25-4 per cent in 1974 to 29-1 per cent in 1975.
In 1974 there was a marked change in the pattern of British exports. Following
the oil price rise at the end of 1973, which generated large reserves for the oil¬
exporting countries, British exports to these countries rose in value by 51 per
cent between 1973 and 1974, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total
growth in exports over this period. On the other hand, the slowdown in
activity in most of the developed economies during 1974 had similar con¬
sequences for British exports to these economies. A similar pattern obtained in
I975> when the value of exports to the oil-exporting countries grew by 88 per
cent, to other member countries of the European Community by 16 per cent

In 1976 exports to the developed industrial countries have continued the
recovery which began in the latter part of 1975 as economic conditions in the
European Community and the United States improved. Details of Britain’s
principal export markets and sources of supply in 1974 and 1975 are given in

As far back as estimates have been made, that is, for nearly two centuries,
Britain has usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions: the receipts
and payments arising from services (as distinct from goods) supplied to and
received from overseas residents; the income arising from outward and inward
investment; and transfers between Britain and other countries.
The invisible transactions involved are divided for statistical purposes into
six main groups: government services and transfers; transport (shipping and
civil aviation); travel; other services (which covers a variety of items including
the financial services of the City of London); interest, profits and dividends;
TRADE AND PAYMENTS

and private transfers (migrants’ funds, legacies and private gifts). Table 32
shows the breakdown of the figures from 1965 to 1975. The total invisible
balance in 1975 was £1,531 million. Gross earnings of £11,038 million from
total invisible exports were about three-fifths of the total of £18,768 million
from visible exports.
As shown in Table 32 in recent years there has been a considerable and
rapidly rising net surplus on ‘other services’ and another large surplus on
interest, profits and dividends. There has also been a surplus on civil aviation
services throughout the past decade. Sea transport transactions have been in
deficit since 1969. Except in 1973, travel credits have exceeded debits since
1968, mainly because of the continuing increase in the number of travellers
(including tourists) visiting Britain and in the average expenditure per visitor.
About half the total debits in respect of government expenditure relate to
military expenditure overseas and this has remained steady or fallen in real
terms in recent years, though currency changes have caused the sterling value
to rise; other substantial items of expenditure are grants to developing countries,
expenditure on the diplomatic service, subscriptions to international organisa¬
tions, and Britain’s contribution to the common budget for the financing of
European Community expenditure.

COMMERCIAL
POLICY
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
374 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). As a member of the European Community,
Britain is committed to working for the development of world trade by the
progressive reduction through reciprocal measures of both tariff and non-tariff
barriers. The Community’s Common External Tariff (CET) is lower than that
of several other major industrial countries.
General Agree- Britain’s protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years as a
ment on Tariffs result of negotiations held under the auspices of GATT which also seek to
and Trade increase the volume of world trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade,
and by eliminating discrimination in international commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (May 1964-June 1967), a series of GATT
tariff negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made by the
major trading countries, including Britain, in their tariffs on industrial goods.
A new series of negotiations was formerly launched in Tokyo in September
1973 ancf substantive discussions began in Geneva in February 1975. The
negotiations cover a wide range of both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.
Community All tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the other Euro-
Preference pean Community countries are being eliminated in five equal stages over the
transitional period ending 1st July 1977. By the same date Britain will be
applying the common external tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor
having any special arrangement with, the Community, subject to special
arrangements for some industrial materials. By the same date also virtually all
industrial tariff barriers between the European Community and the remaining
member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), to which
Britain belonged between i960 and 1972, will have been dismantled.
Commonwealth Reciprocal preferential tariff treatment for trade between Britain and other
and Developing independent Commonwealth countries dates from the Ottawa Conference of
Countries I932-
The special trading relations between Britain and 22 developing Common¬
wealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP)1 were replaced
by the Convention of Lome, the trade provisions of which came into effect on
1st July 1975. This established new trade, aid and co-operation links between
the Community and a total of 46 developing ACP countries.2 The Convention
safeguards the interests of Commonwealth and other countries dependent on
the export of particular agricultural products, including sugar for which access
to Community markets has been guaranteed for an indefinite period at prices
related to those in the Community and in quantities which the producing
countries have undertaken to supply.
All British dependent territories (with the exception of Gibraltar, Hong Kong
and Bermuda), together with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) of
other Community members, were formally linked with the Community as a

whole in 1976 under arrangements similar to those embodied in the Con¬
vention of Lome. (The trade arrangements that will operate under this new
association were brought into effect on an interim basis in August 1975.) The
preference for imports from Commonwealth countries which are neither
signatories of the Lome agreement nor members of the OCT will be phased
out by 1st July 1977.
Other special arrangements have been agreed relating to continued access
into the Community for New Zealand dairy products.
The Community has stated its continuing objective of expanding and re¬
inforcing existing trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia,
taking into account the scope of the generalised system of preferences (see
below) from which they derive considerable benefit. A commercial co-operation
agreement between the Community and India came into effect in 1974, and
with Sri Lanka in October 1975. An agreement with Pakistan was signed in
June 1976.
The establishment of a generalised system of preferences for manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries was agreed in principle
at the second UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme
started early in 1972, but, as a member of the European Community, Britain
adopted in 1974 scheme of the enlarged Community. The Community’s
scheme has been considerably improved since the enlargement by the establish¬
ment of more liberal access into the Community for imports of manufactured
and processed agricultural products from developing countries. Continued
improvement of the scheme is to be made with the interests of the poorest
developing countries (particularly those of Asian members of the Common¬
wealth) in mind.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and information
and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries. Export promotion
is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), the
Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the Depart¬
ment of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s export promotion
programme, including the provision of export intelligence, help to exporters at
trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and support for firms
participating in missions overseas and for inward commercial visits to Britain.
It includes representatives of commerce and industry, the Trades Union
Congress, the Department of Trade and the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and operates under the general authority of the Secretary of State for
Trade who is the President.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the export offices of the
Department of Industry throughout Britain and, through these offices, the
commercial posts of the British Diplomatic Service overseas.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial con¬
ditions and (together with the Export Services and Promotions Division of the
BOTB) generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations. Assistance is also given to British exporters in appointing
agents and locating potential importers.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insurance
for more than a third of the country’s export trade and for much of the external
trade of British merchants.
The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the
buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment,
new import restrictions, war, or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover
may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date
of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of repay¬
ment given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for contracts
over £250,000, the ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enab¬
ling them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed
buying programme of an overseas country. The banks provide finance against
these guarantees.
Since 1975 the ECGD has offered a measure of cover against high and
unpredictable cost escalation to exporters with capital goods contracts worth
over £2 million which involve a manufacturing period of over two years. Since
the same date it has also been prepared to support the issue of performance
bonds in the commercial market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts
worth over £2 million.
Investment insurance is also provided for new British investment against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information
and financial assistance to exporters. In 1973 a British Export Marketing
Centre was opened in Tokyo to provide exhibitions and other marketing
facilities for individual British firms or organisations.
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or export
of goods. Several other departments have separate powers to control imports
and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the IMF,
and its European Community membership, Britain has progressively removed
quantitative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market economies.
There has also been a continuing substantial relaxation of quantitative restric¬
tions on imports from centrally planned economies. In 1975 the importation of
gold coins, gold medals and similar articles, minted or made after 1837, was
made subject to individual licensing; the remaining controls include those
recognised internationally on a few goods such as arms, ammunition and
radioactive materials. Controlled goods require a specific import licence and
some are subject to quota restrictions. Some further restrictions or prohibitions
are applied under separate legislation for the protection of health or public
safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other non-economic reasons (for
example, on animals, drugs and explosives). There is also a general import

restriction on goods from Rhodesia as part of the Government’s sanctions
policy against the illegal regime.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the scheduled territories are paid for in the proper manner most British exports
are not subject to any government control or direction. The few controls that
are in operation are imposed to supervise exports of military and strategic
importance; to conserve materials which may be in short supply; on diamonds
to assist exchange control operations (see below) in preventing the export of
capital in that form; to ensure the humane treatment of cattle, sheep and pigs;
and to prevent the export of antiques (including works of art and documents),
and documentary and photographic material over 70 years old, on grounds of
national importance. There is a general export prohibition on goods to
Rhodesia. (The scheduled territories comprise the United Kingdom, the
Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.)
Britain applies exchange control principally in order to conserve its reserves of
gold and foreign exchange. The powers under the Exchange Control Act 1947
are conferred mainly on the Treasury which has delegated the administration
of most parts of the Act to the Bank of England and to HM Customs and Excise.
The Bank has in turn authorised most commercial banks in Britain to execute a
wide range of transactions.
The general effect of exchange control regulations is to control transactions
between residents of the scheduled territories and non-residents. Payments in
sterling may in general be made freely between residents, but the acquisition of
other currencies by them is subject to control.
The aim of exchange control policy is not to discourage investment abroad
but to regulate the manner in which investment outside the scheduled terri¬
tories is financed. Official exchange is usually available only for projects which
promise early and continuing benefits to the balance of payments. Where the
use of official exchange is not permitted investors can finance their approved
projects in other ways, for example, by borrowing foreign currency or pur¬
chasing investment currency (which, because it is drawn from a limited pool
of currency, normally changes hands at a premium). Payments for goods
exported to destinations outside the scheduled territories have in general to be
in foreign currency or in sterling from an external account, and must be
received within six months of export unless they are covered by an approved
export credit arrangement. Control is also exercised over imports to ensure that
currency authorised for their payment is used for that purpose.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. Purchases of gold coins
minted after 1837 by United Kingdom residents other than authorised dealers
in gold are allowed only if the coins are in Britain and are being sold by a resident
who is not selling on behalf of a non-resident.
Residents are entitled to purchase up to £300 in foreign currency for their
travel expenditure on each journey outside the scheduled territories, other than
to Rhodesia, irrespective of the purpose of the journey. Further travel funds
may be obtained for business, professional or other reasons. Non-residents may
be permitted by the Bank of England to hold an external account in a British
bank and are entitled to change their sterling on external account for other
currencies and to make and receive payments in any currency to and from non¬
residents in any other part of the world. Special restrictions apply to transactions
with residents of Rhodesia.
378
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
People living outside the scheduled territories who visit Britain temporarily
are regarded as non-resident and not subject to most of the exchange control
provisions. On the other hand, people coming to Britain from outside the
scheduled territories and intending to take up permanent residence in Britain
are normally regarded as resident, though they may be eligible for certain
exemptions from their obligations under the Exchange Control Act 1947.
Visitors to Britain may import notes in any currency, travellers’ cheques and
letters of credit without limit. On departure, visitors may take with them
sterling or scheduled territory notes up to a value of £25, foreign currency
notes up to a value of £300 and, as a concession, any foreign currency notes
which they brought in with them.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of the balance
of payments and its main constituent items are given in summary since 1965 in
Table 33 and in greater detail since 1973 in Tables 34 and 35. The balance of
payments statistics contain two indicators of particular importance. The first is
the balance on current account, covering both visible (exports and imports of
goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment income and transfers)
transactions. This, together with capital transfers, provides a measure of how
far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding to or using up overseas
assets. The second indicator is the balance for official financing. This is the

transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and changes in Britain’s net
external banking and money market liabilities in sterling and in overseas
currencies) and other flows which are unidentified transactions reflected in the
balancing item. The balance for official financing shows the impact of all
external flows on the reserves and official debt position, that is, how much is
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
379
available to add to the reserves and repay any official borrowing in the case of a
net surplus, or how much must be financed by drawing on the reserves or by
borrowing if there is a net deficit. Table 34 gives details of the current account
since 1973. Both exports and imports rose strongly after the devaluation of
sterling in 1967. In 1971 exports rose in value faster than imports resulting in
the highest-ever surplus on visible trade of £280 million which, together with a
substantial surplus on invisibles, produced a record current account surplus of
£ 1,084 million. This trend was reversed in 1972 and 1973 with the development
of a visible trade deficit reflecting increases in world commodity prices,
expansion of activity in the domestic economy, and the depreciation of sterling.
The increase in oil prices (see p. 370) was the main cause of a substantial rise
in the visible deficit in 1974 to £5,22° million, offset to some extent by a surplus
on invisibles of £1,873 million. In 1975, the low level of domestic activity and
substantial de-stocking reduced the volume of imports, more than offsetting
the decline in the volume of exports resulting from the setback in world trade.
The visible trade deficit consequently declined to £3,204 million while that
on non-oil goods was almost eliminated.
In the period 1963-68, there was a deficit for official financing of £3,778
million (including a gold subscription of £44 million to the IMF) financed
mainly by official borrowing totalling £3,134 million, but also by transfers to
the reserves of the dollar portfolio totalling £520 million; and a reduction of
£124 million in the reserves. In 1969 there was a reversal of this deficit and a
rapidly increasing surplus for official financing which in 1971 reached £3,146
million. During this period almost all short- and medium-term official borrow¬
ing was repaid, and there was a substantial increase in the reserves. There was a
net deficit of £1,479 million in 1975.
There was a net inflow in 1975 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of some £188 million. Overseas investment in the private sector
fell in 1975 to about £1,760 million. Private investment overseas, at about

overseas includes a substantial element of reinvested profits. In 1973 ^ also
included a number of large acquisitions of overseas companies by British ones.
Direct investment overseas declined in 1975 as number and level of
acquisitions fell.
Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights. (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IIVIF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its IMF
quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide convertible
currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant in
exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of their
own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong balance
of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in certain
direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments of
various kinds to the IMF. The role of SDRs as a central standard of value in
international transactions (see p. 197) is being enhanced. Britain participates in
the IMF oil facility and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Financial Support Fund.
Britain has also taken part since 1961 in the international network of re¬
ciprocal credit (swap) facilities arranged between central banks. Under these
arrangements each central bank is able to exchange on request, for a limited
period, its own currency for the currency of another country up to an agreed
maximum. It agrees to reverse the transaction at a specified date at the same
rate of exchange. The currencies so obtained can be added to the reserves or
used in exchange operations.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities1 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included that
are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valuation.
The inventory for the end of 1975 shows that Britain had a net creditor position
estimated at some £1,155 rmllion.
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been £23,555 million at the end of 1975. This compares with a figure of £8,070
million at the end of 1962. Direct investment, including oil, accounted for
£16,930 million of the total figure for end-1975, the balance consisting of
£6,625 million of portfolio investment.
United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1975 totalled
£6,592 million.2 Within this total banking claims were £3,568 million; sup¬
pliers’ export credit to unrelated firms was £2,575 million. With the increase in
recent years in British aid to developing countries, inter-governmental loans of
£1,227 million form the largest item among official external assets, which at the
end of 1975 were £3,688 million including refinanced export credit. The latter
figure, together with official reserves of £2,683 million, £6,592 million in
banking and commercial claims and private investment overseas of £23,555
million, resulted in aggregate identified external assets at the end of 1975 of
some £36,520 million.

Identified external liabilities at the end of 1975 are estimated to have been some
£35,365 million. All official short- and medium-term liabilities to the IMF and
other monetary authorities were repaid in 1972 but foreign currency borrowing
by the Government since late in 1974 totalled £1,235 million ($2,500 million)
at the end of 1975. Foreign currency borrowing by the public sector under the
exchange cover schemes commenced in 1969 became substantial in 1973 and
1974 and totalled £3,174 million at the end of 1975. Inter-governmental loans
to Britain and other official liabilities, mainly a consequence of the second world
war and its aftermath, totalled £2,021 million at the end of 1975 of which
£1,564 million was owed to the United States and £393 million to Canada.

Other public sector liabilities of -£4,006 million comprised overseas holdings
of British government and public corporations’ sterling securities, holdings of
Treasury bills and notes, local authorities’ securities and mortgages and bor¬
rowings by British public corporations and local authorities other than under
the exchange cover schemes. British banking and commercial liabilities,
including liabilities in sterling and in foreign currencies, totalled £10,098
million.1 Liabilities in the form of overseas investment in Britain’s private
sector totalled £14,480 million.
Foreign holdings in Britain of sterling in the form of British government
securities (where these were held by central monetary institutions and inter¬
national organisations other than the IMF), bank deposits, deposits with local
authorities and hire purchase companies, and Treasury bills totalled £7,254
million at the end of March 1976. Of this, £3,096 million was held by residents
of oil exporting countries, £921 million by residents of other member countries
of the European Community and £3,237 million by other holders. The total
of these liabilities (excluding the counterpart of borrowing) remained broadly
constant between the end of 1945 and 1970 but rose sharply during 1971 and
1972 and again during 1974, changing relatively little during 1975. They reflect
the international trading and reserve role of sterling and in part the financial
services of the City.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £3,165 million in 1962 to £ 14,480 million at the end of 1975.
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale of
their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued. Earnings
and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1975 the inflow of
direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil, amounted to
£1,760 million.2
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1975
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies in¬
corporated abroad—£5,735 million (excluding oil, banking, and insurance);
portfolio holdings of British securities—£2,955 million; the book value of the
net assets in Britain of overseas oil companies—£4,100 million; and the balance
of £1,690 million which included borrowing by British companies overseas.
About two-thirds of the direct investment of £5,735 million originally came
from North America and about one-fifth from Western Europe. Of the £797
million inflow of direct investment into Britain in 1974 £432 million originated
from North America and £70 million from other member countries of the
European Community. Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits
to British industry, including technological development which in turn will
strengthen the economy and its balance of payments position.
Approval is readily obtained for financing direct investment projects by
borrowing abroad on appropriate terms. There is also scope for the investment
of retained profits of subsidiary companies overseas. In recent years a consider¬
able proportion of net direct investment outflow has been financed in this way.
1 This sector covers the London banks’ operations in the Euro-currency markets in
which very large non-sterling currency liabilities are broadly matched by non-sterling
assets. Only net liabilities of £2,547 million are included in the external liabilities figure;
they represent the difference between assets of £58,155 million and liabilities of £60,702
million.
2 Direct investment refers mainly to the establishment of subsidiary companies and
banks, while portfolio investment refers to investment in company securities.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS

Sterling finance is available in certain cases when projects promise early and
substantial benefits to Britain’s balance of payments.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was ^1,124 rnillion in 1975 com¬
pared with ^i,595 million in 1974. The latest available area analysis indicates
that of the 1974 figure £224 million was placed in developing countries, £367
million in other member countries of the European Community and £488
million in North America. With the inclusion of oil, portfolio and other invest¬
ment, aggregate private investment outflows totalled £1,405 million in 1975
compared with £1,169 million in 1973, while portfolio disinvestment of
£755 million in 1974 changed, in 1975, to net investment of £41 million.
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
AID TO
DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries, which is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Overseas Development, consists of loans and grants for
economic and social development, technical co-operation, budget support and
contributions to multilateral agencies providing financial aid and technical
co-operation to these countries. To complement the official programme private
investment is encouraged by the provision of government insurance to private
investors by the ECGD. In addition an important contribution is made to
economic development by private voluntary organisations engaged in relief,
development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to nearly £4,761
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1972—75
was about £365 million. In 1975 official aid flows totalled some £445-6 million,
of which £431-9 million represented official development assistance (see
Table 36) and £137 million other official flows. Of the overall total, bilateral
aid accounted for £308-1 million including technical co-operation funds of
£96 3 million, assistance provided through multilateral agencies was £137-5
million. Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the year on
loans made previously came to £47-7 million and £41-2 million respectively.
In recognition of the special importance of the role of official development
assistance, the strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in
1970, included a recommendation that each developed country should pro¬
gressively increase its official development assistance to the developing coun¬
tries and exert its best efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of 0-7 per
cent of its gross national product (GNP) to them by the middle of the decade.
Britain has now accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent GNP target and will seek
in the years ahead to move towards it. The speed at which it can do so, however,
must be subject to the pace of Britain’s own economic recovery and to other
calls on its resources. Britain has also accepted the UN target of 1 per cent of
GNP for total net financial flows (that is, including private and official flows)
to developing countries. In 1975, in a major policy statement, contained in a
report entitled The Changing Emphasis in British Aid Policies—More Help for
the Poorest (see p. 469), the British Government outlined its intention to adapt
its aid policies to meet the needs of the poorest countries and the poorest
communities within these countries, with particular emphasis being placed on
rural development.
I975 gr°ss disbursements of British official flows were £445-6 million;
net of amortisation receipts, these amounted to £397-9 million (0-39 per cent of
NP). net disbursements of official development assistance within this were
£388-3 million (0-38 per cent of GNP). Public expenditure plans for the aid
programme are published annually in the report on public expenditure, the
most recent of which covers the years up to 1979-80 (see Bibliography, p. 469).

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Bilateral
Financial Aid
Under this method of aid determination, introduced in 1971, totals at constant
prices, net of amortisation, are agreed by ministers for five years ahead. The
gross total, which is used for allocating funds to various aid programmes, is
arrived at by adding the estimated amortisation receipts to the net figure. It is
expected that the overall aid programme will continue to rise in cash terms.
Bilateral financial aid in 1975 totalled £216-1 million; over 33 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £9-3 million in 1975, is provided in
the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on the
economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries; the
greater part of it has been in loans, but this will now change following the deci¬
sion taken in June 1975 to provide future aid to the poorest developing countries
(which include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many African countries) in
the form of grants. The terms of new development loans from Britain have been
progressively softened since 1958 and a policy of making interest-free loans to
lighten the repayment burdens of the poorer developing countries was intro¬
duced in June 1965. In 1975 the total value of bilateral loan commitments
entered into by the British Government, excluding investments by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (see p. 385), was £38 million and
of this over 88 per cent was on interest-free terms. The recipients included
India, Bangladesh, Peru, Ecuador, Ghana and Swaziland.
Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 3 per
cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from three to seven years’ grace
periods during which repayments of capital are not made. Of all loans com¬
mitted in 1975 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has more than fulfilled
the 1972 recommendations of the Development Assistance Committee of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on easing
the terms of financial aid.

385
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and a
foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid
in appropriate cases. Loans committed after 1st October 1975, however, will
be untied, if the recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased from
the poorest developing countries as well as from Britain. Between 1958 and the
end of 1975, 443 loans were negotiated involving a commitment of £1,479
million, of which £1,324 million has been disbursed. The recipients of the
largest amounts have been India and Pakistan. During the same period bilateral
grant commitments amounted to around £1,706 million.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the
world’s poorest countries. In 1975 £233-3 million (78-2 per cent) of the bilateral
programme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries and dependencies.
In the past, development aid to the dependent territories was given under the
Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W) Acts, largely in the form of
grants. Expenditure on economic and social development up to the termination
of the Acts on 31st March 1970 amounted to some £450 million. The aid
requirements of the few remaining dependencies are now provided under the
authority of the Overseas Aid Act 1966. In 1975 the territories received £30-4
million in bilateral financial aid and technical co-operation funds.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government
in 1948, to assist the economic development of the then dependent territories.
Subsequent legislation extended its area of operations to independent Com¬
monwealth countries and, with the approval of the Minister of Overseas
Development, to other countries. By the end of 1975 some £217-6 million had
been invested out of a total commitment of £267-5 million. Of the latter, £53-7
million was in East Asia and the Pacific Islands, £52-6 million in the Caribbean
and virtually all of the remainder in Africa. New commitments approved in
1975 totalled over £22-1 million.
Expenditure on bilateral technical co-operation (the provision of skilled
personnel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was £96-2
million, 31 per cent of total bilateral aid, in 1975. The largest component of
expenditure (£43‘I million in 1975) was on sending or maintaining experts,
including volunteers; the next largest was for students and trainees in Britain
(£i5‘4 million).
Under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme (OSAS) and associated schemes
Britain meets the additional costs of employing experienced expatriate British
personnel in the public services of developing countries. The schemes cost
£21-9 million in 1975.
During i975> 9>832 British persons other than volunteers who were
working in developing countries and financed by the British Government, some
4,566 were engaged in the field of education, 1,246 in public works and com¬
munications, 2,894 public administration, 1,147 *n agriculture and allied
fields, 585 in health services, and 660 in industrial posts.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1975 there were
1,915 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing

overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies; 75 per cent (increased to 80
per cent from April 1976) of the British costs (^0-9 million in 1975) were met
by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 14,700 were financed in Britain in 1975 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth Edu¬
cation Co-operation Scholarships and Education Fellowship Schemes, and
under the various schemes of the British Council.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the Inter¬
national Finance Corporation. The British commitment to IDA in the three
years 1971-73 (The Third Replenishment) was nearly ^141 million; the
contribution to the Fourth Replenishment, which became effective in January
1975, is over £206 million. Britain has contributed, or has agreed to contribute,
to the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank and the African Development Bank. Britain has
contributed £99 million to the United Nations Development Programme since
its inception in 1950 and has provided more experts and training places under
multilateral schemes than any other country. Many British nationals were
serving in developing countries under the United Nations and its specialised
agencies in 1975. Other contributions include those to the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food
Programme and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
An increasing proportion of British development assistance is being chan¬
nelled through the European Community’s aid programme. Community
financial aid takes the form principally of assistance from the European
Development Fund (EDF) to those countries which have a special relationship
with the Community under the Convention of Lome (see p. 374). The EDF for
1975-80 amounts to some £1,900 million, including expenditure on a new
export-earnings stabilisation scheme. Assistance to a number of Mediterranean
countries linked to the Community by trade agreements, is being extended.
The Community’s contribution to the United Nations emergency measures
to assist developing countries most seriously affected by increased prices of oil
and other commodities amounted in 1975-76 to over £34-5 million. Britain’s
share of this total, together with its bilateral contributions to the emergency
measures, was about £4'7 million. It also contributes fully to the Community’s
food aid programme.
Britain is playing a leading part in developing a new Community aid and
development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a world¬
wide basis. This, which would involve all the instruments of Community
development policy, would place greater emphasis on giving help to those
developing countries—many of which are among the world’s poorest—not
covered by the Lome Convention or having any other special relationship
with the Community.
19 Promotion of the
Sciences
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research and
development as a whole though private industry contributes a larger propor¬
tion of funds for civil research and development. Funds are also provided by
public corpotations, independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is directed to matters of national interest.
The sessional Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and
Technology is one of the specialist committees established to give back-bench
members the opportunity to investigate the policies and administration of the
Government and to participate in the formation of policy (see p. 36). The
members of the committee (not more than 15 in number) are nominated by
the House. The committee has power to call witnesses, generally takes evi¬
dence in public, and reports its findings to the House from time to time.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee provides for a regular ex¬
change of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific
and technological organisations as may be affiliated under its constitution.
The Pattern of Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in
Expenditure 1972-73 is estimated at £1,310 million compared with £658 million in 1961-
62. The proportion this represented of the gross national product remained
fairly steady throughout the 1960s at about 27 per cent, but fell slightly around
the turn of the decade to reach about 2’5 per cent in 1972-73. There were also
divergent trends in some of the components. The share of defence almost
halved during the period whereas that for civil purposes rose until the end of
the decade when it too fell back. Civil research and development financed from
non-government funds represented an increased share of the total claim on
resources in 1966-67 compared with earlier years, but has fallen steadily since.
In 1972-73 private industry spent about £739 million of which £471 million
was privately funded and £268 million came from Government.
The Government continues to finance just over half the research and
development but carries out only one-fifth in its own establishments com¬
pared with a quarter in the 1960s.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Central responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, who is advised by the Advisory Board for the
Research Councils (see p. 388). Responsibility for technology rests mainly
with the Secretary of State for Industry. Other government departments are
responsible for research and development related to their executive responsi¬
bilities. In 1972 the Government extended the customer-contractor approach

to all its applied research and development, whereby each department as
customer, with advice from its Chief Scientist, defines requirements and the
work is undertaken by contractors (government laboratories, research coun¬
cils, research associations, industry and the universities).
The Lord Privy Seal is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate co¬
operation and co-ordination between departments in science and technology.
An Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development has been
established under the Lord Privy Seal’s chairmanship to provide a central
forum of external advice.
The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 47) discharges its
responsibilities for basic and applied civil science mainly through the five
research councils: The Agricultural Research Council, the Medical Research
Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Science Research
Council and the Social Science Research Council and provides financial
grants to the British Museum (Natural History) and to the Royal Society
(see p. 399). On all these it spent about ^228-3 million in 1975-76 of which
about ,£191-4 million came from the department’s science budget and about
^36-9 million was transferred from other departments under the customer-
contractor principle. The department is also responsible for some aspects of
international scientific relations (see p. 403) and helps to co-ordinate govern¬
ment policy regarding scientific and technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research
council system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance
between national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation
of the science budget between research councils and other bodies; and pro¬
motes close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its
membership includes the chairman or secretary of each of the five research
councils, the chairman of the University Grants Committee, senior scientists
from departments with a major interest in the work of the research councils,
and independent members drawn from the universities, industry and the
Royal Society of London.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931 under Royal
Charter (since amended), consists of a chairman and 18-21 other members. It
is supported in part by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the
Secretary of State for Education and Science; over half its expenditure is for
work commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The ARC is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and 10 units
which it has established under distinguished scientists associated with uni¬
versities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from
the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC also makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It makes a limited number of post¬
graduate training awards.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) was established under Royal Charter
in 1920, as successor to a Medical Research Committee first appointed in 1913.
The Council, which now consists of a chairman, deputy chairman and 14-18

other members, was granted a new Charter in 1966 (since further amended).
It is supported mainly by a grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the
Secretary of State for Education and Science and also receives funds from
the health departments and Department of Employment for the support of
commissioned research.
The MRC’s principal objectives are: to advance knowledge that will im¬
prove physical and mental health; and to develop the biomedical sciences as
such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher
education. The council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology
and Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. The Council is also advised by an Environmental Medicine (Research
Policy) Committee on policy for the support of research on environmental,
occupational problems and problems of social medicine that often extends
beyond the responsibility of its advisory boards. In addition, the MRC is
advised by committees concerned with particular aspects of its work and with
research grants. The MRC’s arrangements for the support of research fall under
four main headings: investigations by members of its scientific staff, mostly
working in its own establishments; short-term (‘project’) grants to workers in
universities and elsewhere; long-term grants in support of specific research
programmes in university departments (‘programme grants’ and ‘research
groups’); and research training awards (fellowships and studentships) tenable
both at home and overseas. The research undertaken ranges from basic
biological research at the molecular level and the extensive laboratory work
that forms the scientific basis of the practice of medicine to the study of
patients and relevant epidemiological and population surveys.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park, London, which forms an integral part of Northwick Park
Hospital. In addition the council has over 60 research units, which are mostly
located in university departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Ministry of Overseas Development (see p. 404), maintains laboratories in
The Gambia and in Jamaica.
Besides financing the Medical Research Council, the Government also
supports medical research through block grants to universities distributed
through the Department of Education and Science and the University Grants
Committee, and through the research and development programme of the
Department of Health and Social Security (see p. 397). Certain government-
financed research for defence purposes, for example, at the Microbiological
Establishment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical
science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the
Cancer Research Campaign.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established by
Royal Charter in 1965 with responsibility to encourage, plan and execute
research in sciences, physical and biological, relating to man’s natural environ¬
ment and its resources. Such investigations seek to provide a better under¬
standing not only of the nature and processes of the environment in which we

live and on whose resources we depend, but also of their influence on man’s
activities and, of growing importance today, of man’s influence on them.
These researches are broadly grouped and defined as: the Solid Earth—its
physical properties and mineral resources; Seas and Oceans—their behaviour
and living and mineral resources; Inland Waters—their behaviour and living
resources; Terrestrial Environments—wild-life communities and their re¬
sources; Atmosphere—its structure and interactions; and a number of
interdisciplinary studies including pollution and the physical and biological
properties of the Antarctic environment.
The council carries out research and training through its own institutes,
grant-aided institutes, and by grants, fellowships and other postgraduate
awards to universities and other institutes of higher education.
The council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Experimental Cartography Unit, the Institute of Geological Sciences, the
Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of Marine Biochemistry, the Institute
for Marine Environmental Research, the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences,
the Institute of Terrestrial.Ecology, and the Unit of Invertebrate Virology.
The council also maintains a research vessel base to service and operate its
research vessels.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate
Biology, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology and other smaller units
attached to universities.
The statutory council consists of a chairman and up to 18 members. The
council is financed by a grant-in-aid from Parliament, received through the
Department of Education and Science, and by commissioned research under
the customer-contractor principle (see p. 387).
The Science Research Council (SRC), comprising a chairman and 14-18 other
members, was established under Royal Charter in 1965 and is supported by
parliamentary grants-in-aid through the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The council supports basic research in astronomy, the biological
sciences, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics in furthering its
primary purpose of sustaining standards of education and research in the
universities. The council devotes most of its resources to: helping university
staff to carry out basic research either in their university or in one of the
council’s research establishments, or elsewhere; and enabling suitable
graduates to receive further training in methods of research or a specialised
branch of science or engineering of importance to British industry.
The council maintains five research establishments: the Appleton Labora¬
tory, Daresbury Laboratory, Royal Greenwich Observatory, The Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh and Rutherford Laboratory. These establishments
are each centres of specialised research but are also used for the development of
new research equipment beyond the resources of a university (for example, the
new high-power laser facility being assembled at the Rutherford Laboratory).
They provide support for university scientists whose research needs access to
facilities run by international research organisations, such as the powerful
particle accelerators at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research
(CERN), the 150-inch Anglo-Australian Telescope, and the high-flux neutron
source at the Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL).
The council provides national contributions to the CERN, the civil science
programme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the European

Incoherent Scatter Project (EISCAT) and part of the European Space Agency
(ESA) contribution. It also contributes to, and shares with its French and
German partners, the control of the ILL reactor at Grenoble. The council
awards studentships for training in methods of research or advanced courses
of study; and fellowships to promising young scientists or engineers to enable
them to carry out an independent research programme that they themselves
have put forward.
The provision of facilities for research in high energy physics is the function
of the SRC. The SRC establishments concerned are the Rutherford Labora¬
tory, Chilton, with a 7 GeV (thousand million electron volt) proton synchro¬
tron (particle accelerator), and the Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, with a
5 GeV electron synchrotron.
The ^future of these accelerators is being considered in the light of the
SRC s reduced budget. Experiments at higher energies are carried out at the
European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) to which Britain
contributes through the SRC.
Astronomy uses both ground-based techniques, such as optical and radio
telescopes, and space-based methods (see p. 406). Optical astronomy is
carried out in university departments and in the Royal Greenwich Observa¬
tory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, under the SRC. The 98-in (2-5 m)
Isaac Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory is operated as a
national facility. A 150-in (3-8 m) telescope has been inaugurated at Siding
Spring Mountain in Australia as a joint Anglo-Australian project, while a
British 48-in (i-2 m) Schmidt Telescope is working on the same sita. Optical
telescopes operated by the South African Astronomical Observatory, to which
the SRC contributes, are available for use by British astronomers.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from SRC. The fully steerable
250-ft (76‘2 m) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has been
modernised. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed
and made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two arrays of
telescopes with i-mile (i‘6-km) and o*5-mile (o’S-km) baseline have been
complemented by a 5-kilometre (3-1-mile) array.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was established under Royal
Charter in 1965 to encourage, support and carry out research in, and to
disseminate knowledge about, the social sciences. The Council consists of a
chairman and I3~i9 other members, and is supported by grant-in-aid provided
by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Science. It
provides grants for research projects at universities and other institutions, and
makes training awards to postgraduate students. It has also set up five
research units: the Industrial Relations Unit, the Cambridge Population Unit,
the Ethnic Relations Unit, and the Survey Unit, and the Socio-legal Studies
Centre. The SSRC s fields of interest include economics; political science;
psychology, social anthropology; social and economic statistics; sociology
and social administration; social science and government; education; manage¬
ment and industrial relations; human geography; linguistics; planning and
various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large

research unit carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies. The Social
Survey conducts sample survey inquiries at the request of government depart¬
ments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration with uni¬
versities and other independent research organisations.
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1974-75 (over £166 million), the largest government contribution (over
fiioi million) was through the University Grants Committee (UGC).
Scientific research in the universities (and other institutions of higher
education) is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, about half the postgraduate students in science and tech¬
nology in the universities and other institutions receive maintenance awards
from the research councils, through postgraduate studentships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years of training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
awards is about ^i4’4 million a year. Second, grants and contracts are given
to the universities and other institutions by the research councils for specified
projects, particularly in new or developing areas of research. These total
about £34-3 million a year. The ARC, MRC and SSRC maintain a number of
research units within universities. Also the research councils provide central
facilities in their own establishments for use by university research workers.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
UGC amount to about a third of the total university expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
According to data derived from the Census of Population 1971 there were in
1971 some 448,870 persons with qualifications in engineering, technology and
science in Great Britain, of whom about one-half were qualified in science and
one-half in engineering and technology. Of those economically active (387,440),
47 per cent (185,470) held engineering qualifications, i-8 per cent (7,300) were
out of employment, and 40 per cent employed in manufacturing. Education
employed over 21 per cent and over the years 1959 to 1971 there was an increase
in the service sectors (commerce and consultancy).
The Department of Energy (see p. 47) is responsible for the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority; research in support of the exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas; research into novel sources of energy; co-ordination of energy
research within government departments; strategic oversight of the research
programmes of the coal, gas and electricity supply industries; and co-ordina¬
tion of British contributions to energy research and development programmes
sponsored by international organisations.
The department has an Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell to
assist in assessing the technological strategy options available to Britain in
energy policy. An Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel
and Power (ACORD) advises the Secretary of State on the general programme
of research and development of the nationalised energy industries and on
other matters related to energy research and development.

An Offshore Energy Technology Board advises the Secretary of State for
Energy on research and development in offshore oil and gas technology and
is responsible for programmes designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of
offshore operations and improve the competitive efficiency of the offshore
equipment industry in Britain.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is the main body carrying out relevant
research and development. Under an Act of 1971, the UKAEA’s fuel cycle
and radiochemical manufacturing activities were given full commercial
form by the establishment of two statutory companies: British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd., Risley, and The Radiochemical Centre Ltd., Amersham, Bucks.; under
an Act of 1973 the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment was trans¬
ferred to the Ministry of Defence.
As an essential part of the Government’s nuclear power programme, the
UKAEA carries out research and develops new types of nuclear reactors for
electricity generation on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and
operates experimental and prototype reactors (see p. 267). The authority also
carries out contract research and development outside nuclear energy.
Apart from a London Office, the UKAEA’s establishments are: the Research
Group headquarters and Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE)
at Harwell and the Culham Laboratory, both in Oxfordshire, the Reactor
Group headquarters and Risley Engineering and Materials Laboratory at
Risley, near Warrington, and Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth,
the Reactor Fuel Element Laboratories at Springfields, Lancs., the Reactor
Development Laboratory at Windscale, Cumbria, the Dounreay Experimental
Reactor establishment in Highland and the Atomic Energy Establishment
at Winfrith in Dorset.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within the framework of intergovernmental agreements, membership of
bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear
Energy Agency of OECD, through direct links on the research side between
the UKAEA and equivalent organisations overseas.
Britain became a full member of the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom) in January 1973 (see 74) under the Treaty of Accession and
under its terms agreed to accept the Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, under
which Euratom was set up, and rules made under it. Britain is taking part in
the four-year Euratom research and training programme agreed in February
I973 and costing over £yo million. The AEA co-operates in the Community’s
five-year programme of research into thermonuclear fusion.
The Department of the Environment1 is concerned with research and develop¬
ment for a whole range of functions which affect the environment (see p. 48).
The department’s research programme is the responsibility of the Director
General of Research. The department has research requirement committees,
dealing with a particular policy subject for which the customer requirements
are formulated. External advice on research programmes is received by the

department from the Planning and Transport Research Advisory Council, the
Construction and Housing Research Advisory Council and a special sub¬
committee of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.
About half the department’s programme is carried out at the Building
Research Establishment (see p. 242), the Transport and Road Research
Laboratory (see p. 303), and the Hydraulics Research Station whose function
is to predict the performance of hydraulic civil engineering works and also
their effects on the environment. The other half is the subject of contracts
placed with a wide range of organisations, either by the research establish¬
ments, or by the department’s headquarters.
The department gives grants-in-aid to a number of research organisations
which include: the Centre for Environmental Studies (see p. 168); the
Operational Research Unit of the Royal Institute of Public Administration;
and the Retail Planning Institute. The Construction Industry Research and
Information Association, the Building Services Research and Information
Association, the Timber Research and Development Association and the
Water Research Centre receive grants to support their co-operative research
and related activities. The British Railways Board receives a grant towards
railway research and the London Transport Executive one towards the cost
of its programme of rapid transit research; and the Royal Society, to meet
costs it incurs as British representative on the International Institute of
Applied Systems Analysis.
The Nature Conservancy Council (see p. 172), funded by the Secretary of
State for the Environment, may give grants to anyone (including voluntary
bodies) to carry out projects including research relevant to its functions. The
council also commissions research mainly from the Institute of Terrestrial
Ecology, a component body of the Natural Environment Research Council
(see p. 389). The council also carries out certain research.
The Department of Industry (see also p. 48) is responsible for the sponsor¬
ship of individual manufacturing industries including the aerospace industry,
for technical services to industry, and for industrial research and development,
including the supervision of the industrial research establishments of the
former Department of Trade and Industry, except for the Safety in Mines
Research Establishment (see p. 397). It also sponsors marine and materials
research and development; a National Maritime Institute is being set up
within the department to take over work at present carried out by the Mari¬
time Science and Ship Division of the National Physical Laboratory.
In accordance with the Government’s customer-contractor principle, the
department administers a number of requirements boards to determine the
objectives and balance of the relevant research and development programmes.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals
and minerals; metrology and standards; garment and allied industries. They
are responsible to the Secretary of State for Industry and include representa¬
tives from other departments, industry and bodies in the public sector. The
chief scientist’s boards cover other relevant branches of technology.
The Department of Industry is responsible for five government laboratories.
Of these, the National Physical Laboratory has a primary responsibility for
the national system of measurement and for technical aspects of standards.

It also carries out research into novel uses of computers. The National
Engineering Laboratory, the Warren Spring Laboratory, and the Computer
Aided Design Centre are concerned with industrial developments in mechani¬
cal engineering, chemicals, and computing. The Laboratory of the Government
Chemist provides analytical and advisory services to government departments.
These establishments also undertake contract research for British industry and
overseas firms.
The department also sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with
industry, the universities, and by contracts with, and grants-in-aid to, research
associations.
Expenditure on research and development carried out within or financed by
private industry in 1972-73 was about £789 million of which £268 million
came from government funds. Expenditure in individual industries, including
funds from government sources, was as follows (in £ million): aerospace 208;
electronics (including computers) 160; other electrical engineering 134;
petroleum products 14; other chemical products 122; mechanical engineering
35; motor vehicles 56; scientific instruments 20; food, drink and tobacco
25; textiles 12. Firms in science-based industries commit large private funds
to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 52) has responsi¬
bility for standards and weights and measures, for government support for
the British Standards Institution (see p. 222) and for the Metrication Board
set up to facilitate the transition to the metric system of weights and measures
in Britain (see p. 45°)- ^ a^so operates the British Calibration Service which
provides authenticated certification of the accuracy of measuring instruments
in terms of national standards.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council (see
p. 388), the government agricultural departments and by private industry.
Fisheries research is conducted by the government fisheries departments,
the White Fish Authority, and the Natural Environment Research Council
(which supports the Marine Biological Association, the Scottish Marine
Biological Association and the Freshwater Biological Association). Expendi¬
ture on research and development by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food was estimated to be £29-2 million in 1975-76 and £37-3 million
in 1976-77.
Advice is given to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
Agricultural Research Council, and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries, Scotland, on priorities for all state-aided research and development
in agriculture and food in England, Wales and Scotland, by the Joint Con¬
sultative Organisation (JCO). The JCO comprises members of the farming
and food industries, scientists, economists and members of the departments’
professional, technical and administrative services and consists of five
advisory boards concerned with animals; arable crops and forage; horti¬
culture; food science and technology; and engineering and buildings.
The Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
responsible for framing, commissioning work for, allocating funds to, and

keeping under review, his departments research and development pro¬
gramme. He is also responsible for providing general scientific advice to the
minister over a broad range of ministry policy and contact is maintained with
research and development in other government departments, the research
councils, industry, and the universities.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi-
zootiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry; the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease);
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the third
international laboratory for biological standards. In discharging its responsi¬
bilities inTegard to the plant health services (see p. 291) the Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Harpenden, Herts, carries out research and development on
analytical methods for detecting residues in crop products, and for assessing
the ingredients in pesticide formulation. The Pest Infestation Control
Laboratory at Slough, Berkshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon,
Surrey), engages in research work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food
storage and on harmful mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for
advisory work on their detection and control and acts as an instruction and
liaison centre for home and some overseas work, and is concerned with the
clearance of pesticides for safety including hazards to wild life.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division provides advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular
attention is paid to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including
consideration of food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Health and Social Security, which has responsibilities
for public health, and with other government departments. The division has
a Food Science Laboratory in Norwich concerned with storage of certain
foods, interaction of food additives and food components, heavy metal con¬
tamination and studies arising from food legislation and safety. There is an
increasing demand for advice in connection with international work, including
the European Community food legislation, and also regarding the new
government policies for the support of research at the four food research
associations and elsewhere.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly
concerned with the problem of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for promotion of research in food pro¬
duced by agriculture and in veterinary sciences with the aim of improving
efficiency of production, marketability of foods and the health of plants and
animals. The ministry is also responsible for work on forest science, ecology of
freshwater and marine fish as well as on the biology of freshwater resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains five laboratories
for marine fisheries and shellfish research, one for salmon and freshwater
fisheries research, two concerned with handling and preservation of the fish
catch and with studies of fish as food and one specialising in research into fish
diseases. There are four sea-going research ships and several smaller vessels

for inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry advises fisheries ministers on research
programmes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvi¬
cultural and allied problems (see p. 297). By means of grants, it also aids forest
research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
In 1974 th® Commission’s research establishments were reorganised. All
research and development activities were amalgamated within a research and
development division; and the study of hardwood trees was given more
emphasis, with the concentration of work on lowland forests, amenity and
landscape at Alice Holt Lodge near Farnham, Surrey, and the replacement of
the Soils Research Branch by two Site Studies Branches.
Research is in progress, under the auspices of the Forestry Commission, into
the fungus and its beetle carrier of the disease (commonly known as ‘Dutch’ elm
disease) which attacks and kills elm trees, and, on an international level, into
the possibility of breeding resistant strains of elm. Since the early 1960s the
disease has killed about 6'5 million of the 30 million English elm trees, mainly
in an area south of Chester and the Wash.
The Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, engages in research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities it also undertakes certain
research for civil purposes, including meteorology (see p. 399), civil aviation
(see p. 399), medical research and space research. For defence see p. 116.
The Department of Health and Social Security spent over ^18 million on
research and development in 1974-75 of which nearly £5 million was on
biochemical research through the Medical Research Council. The depart¬
ment is advised by a Chief Scientist supported by a group of independent
advisers covering a wide range of scientific disciplines.
The Department of Employment has a Research and Planning Division to
conduct and advise on its programme of research on socio-economic problems.
Assistance is given to the department in social research by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys and close contact is maintained with the
Social Science Research Council.
The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for the Safety in Mines
Research Establishment which carries out certain other research in the
natural sciences and health and safety in other employment situations. It is
also responsible for the British Approval Service for Electrical Equipment
in Flammable Atmospheres which recommends research and development
work to be financed by Department of Industry grants; and for a group of
scientists concerned with research into commercial explosives, hazardous
substances and flammable liquids and gases.

The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 400-
acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its research departments are: the herbarium
(also the largest in the world with nearly 5 million specimens) concerned
primarily with the classification and accurate determination of plants; and
the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant physiology,
cytology and genetics. There is a seed bank and seed testing unit, a bio¬
chemistry laboratory under the Agricultural Research Council and a cell
physiology laboratory which has a transmission electron microscope for
investigating reproductive physiology and the behaviour of certain glandular
cells. A scanning electron microscope for studies of the surface structures of
plants and pollen is housed in the Jodrell Laboratory. Three museums are
concerned with public exhibitions and the care of reference collections of
economic plant products. The library, in the same building as the herbarium,
was founded in 1852; it consists of more than 100,000 botanical books, about
140,000 reprints and separately issued items and a collection of over 170,000
drawings and paintings of plants.
The Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (founded in 1670), has, since 1969,
been administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scot¬
land. Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell, near
Stranraer, and the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore, near Dunoon, it
maintains large collections of living plants used for research into plant classi¬
fication. Glasshouses at Edinburgh make possible the cultivation of and
research into many tropical groups. The herbarium and library—the finest
outside London—are used for research in taxonomy, cytology, anatomy,
mycology and other subjects. A transmission electron microscope is used for
the study of fine detail of plant structures. An exhibition hall was opened on
the occasion of the tercentenary of the garden in 1970. The Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art is situated within the garden.
The Post Office, for which the Department of Industry is the responsible
department, undertakes research and development on many aspects of the
science and engineering of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and government depart¬
ments. Its new research centre at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, is com¬
pleted and will fully replace existing stations at Dollis Hill, London, and
Backwell, near Bristol.
Research into the effects of pollutants on the natural environment and on
methods of controlling them is spread throughout research establishments of
all kinds, sponsored by central government departments with control responsi¬
bilities (see p. 173). The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution
(see p. 173) advises on the adequacy of such research and conducts
investigations.
A National Radiological Protection Board (see p. 177) carries out research,
makes public and occupational health assessments and provides services in
connection with radiological protection. The board is financed by Parliament
through the Secretary of State for Social Services and by grants from the Atomic
Energy Authority and the Medical Research Council and by income from
services.

The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and some aspects of geophysics, mainly for
civil purposes. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research
sections are at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry of Defence also makes
grants for fundamental meteorological research carried out under the auspices
of the Royal Society or in university departments.
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence undertakes research
on civil aircraft, engines and equipment on behalf of the Department of
Industry. The Civil Aviation Research and Development Board advises the
Civil Aviation Authority on research and development work for which it is
responsible.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
knowledge. The most eminent of those concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activi¬
ties) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution and British
Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The Queen
is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 80, and the main body of Fellows
numbering about 820. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, was for
many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign membership to
four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with the intention of
awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in both the physical and
biological sciences, and in 1975 was further increased to 40, with effect from
the 1976 elections. The society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings-,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson, Henry Dale and Napier Research Professorships and 14
other research professorships supported by a parliamentary grant-in-aid.
Research fellowships in human nutrition supported by the J. Sainsbury
Centenary Grant were inaugurated in 1974. The highest medal awarded is the
Copley Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are
also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester,
Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals. There are seven lectureships: the
Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous
system); the Wilkins (history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology);
the Bernal (social functions of science); and the Clifford Paterson (established
1975 for electrical science and technology). The society has set up committees,
some of them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education
in science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially
engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint-

The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. It also
plays a leading part in international scientific programmes and promotes
exchange visits of scientists with many academies throughout the world. Its

artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, one
of the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and appli¬
cation to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose
chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The society regularly holds
lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective media for
the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments which
have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its
library includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
engineering institutions, promotes the co-ordination of the engineering
profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes is a federal

body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists, mathema¬
ticians, metallurgists and physicists.
A Fellowship of Engineering, envisaged as complementary to the Royal
Society and forming an independent and authoritative forum of eminent
engineering opinion, was formed in 1976. The founder members were
Fellows of the Royal Society, together with a number of other distinguished
engineers who were selected by the chairman of the Council of Engineering
Institutions and the Presidents of the individual engineering institutions.
Further Fellows, up to a total of 1,000, but not more than 60 in one year, are
being elected by the Fellowship.
The MacRobert Award of £25,000 and a gold medal have been presented
annually since 1969 by the Council of Engineering Institutions on behalf of
MacRoberts Trusts, for successful technological innovations contributing to
the national prestige and prosperity of Britain. A fund was endowed in 1972
by the late Lord Rank to be used to reward outstanding contributions to
human nutrition and crop husbandry, and to opto-electronics and nearly
related phenomena. The first Rank prizes were announced in 1976. In giving
awards for technological innovation, the Queen’s Award to Industry scheme
concentrates on the potential application in industry of outstanding achieve¬
ments in advanced technology in the form of processes or products.
There are at least two bodies concerned with the relationship between science
and society: the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science; and the
Council for Science and Society, formed by specialists in the natural and
social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate research into
the social effects of scientific and technological development.
A scheme by which the Government helped firms with similar interests to
form organisations known as research associations, to carry out industrial
research co-operatively, was started in 1917. Encouragement by government
grants, related to the contributions made by the industries concerned, has
lately been phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support, such as that
offered by the Department of Industry’s Requirements Boards. The Depart¬
ment of Industry has technical links (and in most cases contractual relation¬
ships) with more than 30 such associations. In addition there are four (building
services; construction industry; timber; and water) linked with the Depart¬
ment of the Environment, and four (Flour Milling and Baking; Campden
Food Preservation; British Food Manufacturing Industries; and British
Industrial Biological Research) linked with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. Among the largest of the industrial research associations
are those dealing with production engineering, ships, welding, electrical
manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals and
scientific instruments. (See also Chapter 12.) The Textile Research Con¬
ference serves as a focal point for the collective interests of the various
textile research associations.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 13), in particular those con¬
cerned with energy, steel and transport. These organisations also give support
to other organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.

Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A.natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley, Chessington, and 9^rsey (a small collection of some of the rarest
animals in the world). There are also several ‘safari parks’ containing reserva¬
tions of wild animals through which the public can pass in closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history, particularly for research into
classification (taxonomy); it has extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science
Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Geological Survey has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of
information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in
which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
given on p. 419. Two constituents of the British Library (see p. 419) are
concerned with science and technology—the Lending Division, and the
Science Reference Library.
The Lending Division collects for loan purposes all literature which is
likely to be of interest to the practising scientist and technologist, covering all
branches of science and technology (including agriculture and medicine) and
the social sciences.
The Science Reference Library is divided between the Holborn Division,
formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Branch which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences and scientific literature
written in Slavonic and oriental languages.
The rehousing in a new London headquarters of the world’s largest library
devoted to the social sciences—the -British Library of Political and Economic
Science, part of the London School of Economics—is planned for completion
by the end of the present decade.
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an inquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Department of Industry and the AEA devote considerable sums to

advisory and information services. The former has nine regional offices which
make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of existing scientific
and technical knowledge. Its Technology Reports Centre is a national clearing
house for unpublished technical reports made available by various bodies in
Britain and overseas. The industrial research associations circulate research
reports and provide information services to members. Besides information
services provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics Centre
and the Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an informa¬
tion centre at its London headquarters, and a network of regional advisers on
the use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p. 404) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in
Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
public corporation supported as necessary by government loans through the
Department of Industry. The NRDC’s functions are to promote the manu¬
facture by industry, under NRDC licence, of new products and processes
invented in government laboratories, universities and elsewhere, advancing
money where necessary to bring them to a commercially viable stage, and to
speed up technological advance by investing money with British industrial
firms, on a joint venture basis, for the development of their own inventions and
projects. Its borrowing power for government advances is £50 million.
Outstanding advances total ^20 million but the corporation is currently
funding its annual investment in research and development from its income
from licences and levies. Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C
antibiotic, hovercraft, computers, advanced types of electric motor, diving and
other oceanological equipment, packaging equipment, insecticides, micro¬
electronics and plastics,
Britain is represented on the Scientific and Technical Research Committee
(CREST) of the European Community, the object of which is to co-ordinate
national policies on these matters and to implement joint projects of interest
to the Community. Other intergovernmental organisations involved in
scientific co-operation with which Britain is concerned include: European
Co-operation in Science and Technology (COST); specialised agencies of the
United Nations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO),
the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), the Committee for Scientific and Technology Policy,
the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA)
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);
the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN); the European
Space Agency (ESA); the European Molecular Biology Conference (EMBC);
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL); and the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Among non-governmental organisa¬
tions Britain is represented in the international unions comprising the Inter-
404 BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national Council of Scientific Unions (see p. 400). The five research councils,
the Royal Society and the British Academy became founding members of the
European Science Foundation (ESF) set up in November 1974* nuclear
energy Britain also co-operates within the framework of international agree¬
ments ; through direct links between the AEA and its counterparts; and through
joint companies in, for example, nuclear fuel and radioisotope manufacture.
There are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies in France, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United States, and the Soviet
Union who among other things promote scientific contacts between Britain
and the countries to which they are accredited. These counsellors serve all
central government departments concerned in overseas scientific affairs, as
well as the research councils and the Royal Society, which is the main
representative of Britain in areas of non-governmental collaboration. Adminis¬
trative support for the counsellors is provided in Britain by the Department
of Industry, which is their major ‘customer’.
The Ministry The Ministry of Overseas Development promotes scientific activities in the
of Overseas interests of developing countries. These include research covering a wide
Development range of disciplines, specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences
for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in universities
and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and
providing support for existing research services and research projects overseas.
Equipment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage
scientific training. There are three organisations forming part of the ministry,
which are wholly engaged on scientific work to assist developing countries.
They are the Tropical Products Institute, which specialises in the post¬
harvest aspects of agricultural, fish and animal products; the Centre for
Overseas Pest Research, which is concerned with the development and
application of pest control techniques relevant to tropical agriculture; and
the Land Resources Division, which is concerned with all aspects of land
resource appraisal. The ministry also supports the International Agricultural
Research Centres under the aegis of the Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research. The ministry provides over £16 million a year for
scientific activities including research for the benefit of developing countries.
Commonwealth The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
Agricultural the governments of 28 Commonwealth countries and that of the Irish
Bureaux Republic comprise four institutes and ten bureaux, all of which except one
institute are in Britain and each of which is concerned w ith a particular branch
of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses for the interchange of
information of value to research workers in agricultural science throughout
the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the world. Some 18 abstract
journals, one primary journal and an index are published periodically and
have a combined annual circulation of about 30,000 copies. The institutes and
bureaux also issue monographs on their own particular subjects and deal with
inquiries received from research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth.
Three of the institutes undertake taxonomic services for all countries of the
Commonwealth and many countries outside it.
Commonwealth The Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) consists of administrators and
Science scientists nominated by the Governments of Commonwealth member countries
Council and has been brought into close association with the Commonwealth Secre-

tariat. The council concentrates on the organisation of collaborative projects in
science and technology to be undertaken by member countries. An executive
committee of members from various geographical groups which make up
membership of CSC reviews the progress of the programme of its activities
between the organisation’s plenary meetings which take place every two years.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 159) in the sciences (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Overseas, 62 staff with science or science teaching qualifications assist in
scientific and educational development and in scientific collaboration. Empha¬
sis is placed on facilitating the interchange of scientists and teachers and on the
provision of library and information services related to advances in science and
science education in Britain. Overseas tours are arranged for British specialists
to advise, run courses or discuss matters of common interest, and scientists
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, teacher-training
colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum reform centres. The
council invites senior overseas specialists to Britain, and makes awards to
postgraduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number
of senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of
the UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. The council is responsible for administer-
grants awarded under the Academic Interchange with Europe Scheme,
the European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research Workers’
Interchange Scheme and the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme.
In Britain, advisory and information facilities are provided by specialist
departments (and libraries) for education, medicine and science including
science education.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence and the
Secretary of State for Industry, according to the nature of the project, while
the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is concerned
with international aspects. Expenditure on space activities in 1976 was about
£36 million.
The United Kingdom with other European governments has established
a European Space Agency (ESA), agreement for which was reached in April
I975> when a British Director-General was appointed. The other member
countries are Belgium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland; the Irish Republic, Austria
and Norway have observer status. This new organisation has superseded the
European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and
European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) of which the United King¬
dom was also a founder member. It has taken over the existing science pro¬
gramme, four applications satellites and Spacelab—a manned laboratory—in
all of which Britain is actively participating. Among its main responsibilities
will be the fostering of a single co-ordinated European space programme with
a corresponding decrease in purely national activity.
Scientific research, notably in astronomy and geophysics, using space
techniques, is supported by the SRC, which is responsible to the Secretary of
406
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
State for Education and Science. Opportunities are provided for research
workers, particularly in universities, to carry out experiments in British
satellites and sounding rockets in the European Space Agency’s scientific
satellite programme and in various collaborative sounding rocket programmes
through bilateral and multilateral arrangements with other countries, includ¬
ing the Commonwealth collaborative programme. Britain is co-operating with
the United States in a programme which includes American launching of the
British Ariel series of scientific satellites, the incorporation of British experi¬
ments in American satellites, the analyses of lunar surface samples and re¬
ception of signals from the US Viking mission to Mars. The Appleton
Laboratory provides support and services for the universities’ space-based
experiments and also operates the United States National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network
(STDN) station at Winkfield. Optical tracking of satellites is undertaken by
many individual observers in Britain; the prediction and co-ordination centre
is at the Appleton Laboratory, which is also the home of one of the three
World Data Centres for space research. The Space Department of the
Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough also undertakes long-term
research and development intended to assist industry.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
Responsibility for industrial sponsorship of the space industry for Britain’s
space technology programme and for leading the British delegation to the
European Space Agency rests with the Department of Industry. The tech¬
nology programme, now known as the Domestic Space Technology Pro¬
gramme (DSTP) is intended to develop Britain’s industrial capability in
space applications systems. A series of wholly British technology proving
satellites, which culminated in the launching of Miranda in March i974> ^as
been terminated following the decision to set up ESA. Work undertaken
within the DSTP is managed by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry
of Defence on behalf of the Department of Industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for
the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites. Britain and
90 other countries participate in the permanent International Telecommuni¬
cations Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) which started operating early in
1973 in place of the consortium formed in 1964. Britain is the second largest
shareholder and is represented on the organisation’s board of governors by the
Post Office. The Post Office ground stations at Goonhilly in Cornwall are
among the most successful in the world; British firms have built such stations
overseas, and are currently fulfilling further export orders as members of
international consortia.
20 The Arts
Arts Councils
The promotion of literature and the arts and the preservation of Britain’s
cultural heritage are the concern of official and unofficial bodies. The Govern¬
ment and local authorities take an active part in supporting and promoting the
arts and valuable help also comes from private sources, including trusts and
commercial concerns.1 Ministerial responsibility for general arts policy in
Britain is borne by a Minister of State at the Department of Education and
Science; the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
also concerned with cultural matters. In addition, the Government is responsible
through the Department of the Environment and the Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices for the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic
buildings, and grants are made towards the maintenance of privately owned
historic buildings.
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the education departments. They are concerned, in partnership with local
education authorities and voluntary bodies, with arts education in schools,
further education colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and community
centres, and with the public library service.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain is £92
million in 1976-77. Direct allocations include ^37-2 million for the Arts Council
of Great Britain, about ^27-7 million for museums and galleries and some
^15*8 million for the maintenance of historic buildings and ancient monuments
in the care of government departments. The Government also finances the
British Library (see p. 419), the National Library of Scotland and the National
Library of Wales.
Most government support for the creative arts takes the form of grants to
independent agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of
Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are to
develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to
increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations. The council
gives financial help and advice to over 1,200 organisations, from the major
opera, dance and drama companies, orchestras and festivals, to the smallest
touring theatres and experimental groups. It encourages such diverse interests
as contemporary dance, photography and art films, and helps professional
creative writers, musicians, composers, artists and photographers by means of
bursary and award schemes. It promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera and
ballet companies. Funds are provided for specialist training courses in the arts
and the council also assists projects for the construction of new buildings or
improvements to existing theatres, concert halls and other arts buildings under
its ‘Housing the Arts’ scheme.
Members of the council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the council
itself allocates grants to the main artistic bodies in England, but a growing
proportion of its funds is channelled to regional arts associations (see p. 408)
1 A government review is being conducted into the financial situation of the arts.

which allocate funds independently. Organisations in Scotland and Wales
receive their grants from the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils; these are
committees of the Arts Council of Great Britain which allocates to them a part
of its funds.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with similar aims
and functions to that of Great Britain. It receives an annual grant from the
Northern Ireland Department of Education.
The Government promotes knowledge of English literature and culture over¬
seas mainly through the British Council (see footnote, p. 159)) which maintains
134 libraries in the countries in which it is represented. The British Council also
sponsors overseas tours by leading British actors, producers, theatre com¬
panies, musicians, orchestras and opera and ballet companies; it promotes
exhibitions and lectures overseas on the fine arts in Britain and organises
British participation in international exhibitions; and it distributes overseas a
wide range of specialised films, many of them on the arts.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the in¬
dependent television programme companies and the Independent Broadcasting
Authority (IBA). The BBC has orchestras employing about a third of the
country’s full-time professional musicians, and each week it broadcasts
nearly 100 hours of serious music—both live and recorded—on its Radio 3
channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British composers,
and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Independent television com¬
panies make grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions, particularly
to regional arts associations, and transmit general magazine programmes on
the arts. Both the BBC and IBA broadcast a wide range of new drama together
with adaptations of novels and stage plays; they also screen a variety of feature
films including selections of the best British and overseas productions.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms (including cultural activities). Many authorities make contribu¬
tions to regional arts associations (see below) and towards the expenses of
professional symphony orchestras and local theatre companies. Grants are
often made towards the capital cost of new arts buildings, especially theatres,
the Greater London Council, for example, has made a substantial contribution
towards the cost of the new National Theatre.
Private
Contributions
Regional Arts
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters organisations of the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, and an Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts
has been formed to advise interested companies. Sponsorship may take the
form of grants to regional arts associations, local arts festivals and orchestras,
some companies sponsor series of concerts and other cultural events.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
regional arts associations whose aim it is to ensure that the whole range of the
arts is more widely available to people throughout their areas. There are 15 °f
these covering most of England and Wales and they channel financial assistance

to local arts organisations and offer an advisory and promotional service for all
sorts of local arts activities. They are financed by a combination of local
authority, Arts Council and private funds; local authorities and a wide range of
other interests are represented on the associations’ committees.
Examples of co-operative patronage are the orchestra boards which support
symphony and chamber orchestras and the societies formed to present some
of the many arts festivals in Britain. The outstanding example is the Edinburgh
Festival Society, but other festivals organised on a similar basis include those
held in the City of London, Brighton, King’s Lynn, Norwich and York.
There are several hundred arts centres which provide opportunities for enjoy¬
ment and participation in the arts. The centres are supported mainly by
regional arts associations and local authorities with some help from the Arts
Council and other organisations. They may be small centres for amateur
activities or they may offer a professional programme. A number of theatres
and art galleries also provide a focal point for the community by offering
facilities for other arts.
Britain is one of the world’s major centres of theatrical activity. In London
during the summer season, theatres are packed with overseas visitors, while in
the provinces there is enthusiastic support for the work of local repertory
companies. Less formal are the ‘fringe’ theatre groups, particularly in London,
which present short plays often in locations other than theatres. Some of the
groups are itinerant while others use regular locations.
Support for much of the development of British drama comes from growing
government assistance provided through the Arts Councils of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland which provide funds to drama companies registered as
charities (that is, are non-profit-distributing), provided that such companies
have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of
practical competence. The Arts Council assists new drama by offering guaran¬
tees to managements giving the first professional production of selected new
plays; and promising playwrights may be awarded bursaries. Schemes are also
in operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians, actors and actresses
and those wishing to take up theatre administration.
There are over 250 theatres in professional use in Britain that can accommodate
more than 200 people. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distributing
companies, the majority of which are receiving Arts Council subsidies, while
the remainder are operated commercially or are owned by local authorities.
The centre of theatrical activity is in London where there are some 41
principal theatres in or near the West End and another eight in the suburbs.
Most of the theatres are let to producing managements on a commercial basis
but four are occupied by major subsidised companies, including the National
Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies. The former, in its new building
on the south bank of the Thames, stages classical and modern plays from all
countries; the latter presents Shakespearean plays in Stratford-upon-Avon
and a mixed repertoire in London.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. (Both the National Theatre and
Royal Shakespeare companies have toured in Britain and overseas.) The
number of these theatres has been declining and several have now been
purchased by local authorities. Many non-repertory theatres outside London

present all kinds of drama and many also put on variety shows and other
entertainments. There has, however, been a growth in the activities of over 60
repertory companies which receive financial support from the Arts Council and
the local authorities. The repertory companies employ many leading producers,
designers and actors, and standards are high. Some companies have the use of
their own theatres, while others rent from local authorities. Some 25 new
repertory theatres have been built in the past 20 years.
All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. There is no censorship, but the Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as one
which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend it’.
Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on the
grounds that the performance is for the public good in the interests of, for
example, drama, opera or literature.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the Old
Vic School in Bristol. In Scotland there is the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama in Glasgow. Nine universities offer major courses in drama.
Theatre for young people has increased in importance in the past decade and
annual audience attendances are estimated at about 3 million. In 1970 the
Young Vic was opened as a theatre for young people and the National Youth
Theatre has a permanent home in London. There are some ten specialist
companies, including the Unicorn Theatre for Young People, Theatre Centre
and the Polka Company, some of which are supported by the Arts Council.
Outside London about 25 repertory companies provide programmes and
engage in other types of theatre activity for young people. In Northern Ireland
a company called Interplay Theatre, which is sponsored and administered by
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, works mainly in schools.
In addition it is estimated that there are some 200 amateur youth theatres in
Britain, most of which are supported by local authorities. Many schools and
youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in drama. The London
education service provides special drama centres for young people.
Music plays an important role in British cultural life. ‘Pop’ music, folk music,
jazz, light music and brass bands all have substantial followings while the
widespread interest in classical music is reflected in the large audiences at
orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, ballet and chamber music.
Through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Govern¬
ment encourages interest in the various forms of classical music and also jazz.
The councils make grants to orchestras, soloists, opera and dance companies,

music societies and festivals. They also provide bursaries and commissions for
British composers, musicians, designers and choreographers.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In central London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall, adjacent to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the
Purcell Room which accommodate smaller-scale performances, the Royal
Albert Hall, where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given,
and the Wigmore Hall, an important recital centre.
The leading British symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the New
Philharmonia, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the
City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster
Orchestra and the Scottish National. The BBC runs a number of orchestras
providing broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Philomusica of London, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon
Tyne) and the Scottish Philharmonic. Most orchestras (other than those of the
BBC) receive financial aid from the Arts Councils and local authorities, and
some also receive assistance from commercial television and business organisa¬
tions.
Among the principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral Society,
the Bach Choir, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the New Philhar¬
monia Chorus, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast Philhar¬
monic Society. Certain of these are closely associated with famous orchestras
while others combine with them in major choral works; many choral societies
are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Music festivals in Britain, of which the oldest is the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 250 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals, such as that at King’s Lynn, last a week or less.
Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales; the
National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year; the Chel¬
tenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. An annual international festival of folk song and
dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees of
local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The
National Federation of Music Societies, the organisation for chamber music
societies, amateur choirs and amateur orchestras, receives an annual grant from
the Arts Council to assist groups with the cost of engaging professional
soloists. Over 1,000 music societies are members of the federation, which
advises them on matters concerning concert promotion.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts

Council and from private and business sponsorship. The Royal Opera House
has a permanent orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal
Ballet. Both companies have a high international reputation and make overseas
tours. Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the English
National Opera which plays in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial
tours. Its former home, Sadler’s Wells Theatre, provides a London stage for
visiting opera and dance companies from the provinces and from abroad.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast is
specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include the
English Music Theatre Group which specialises in the performance of works
by British composers, the New Opera Company which is associated with the
English National Opera, Scottish Opera and the Welsh National Opera
Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the Northern Ireland
Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group.
Britain’s dance companies also include London’s Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company, which since 1966 has also become a
leading modern dance company), Scottish Ballet, the London Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively) and the Northern Dance Theatre (which
concentrates its activities in the north of England, although it makes periodic
tours elsewhere). The work of the Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland
combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music in
London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are
grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guidhall School of Music and
Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and the
Birmingham School of Music. The London Opera Centre provides advanced
training courses for student singers and stage managers. The leading dance
schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert School of Ballet and the
London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools, have
helped in raising British dance to its present high standard.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and dance.
There are frequent concerts for children, and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, the London Schools’
Symphony Orchestra and several county youth orchestras are noted for their
high standard of performance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to
the international Jeunesses Musicales, encourages attendances by young people
at opera, dance and concert performances. The Royal Ballet sponsors a small
group, Ballet for All, to give an introduction to ballet to the public and to
schools. Educational Dance Drama Theatre and Dance for Everyone receive
financial support for their work with young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and some
250,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the examinations
of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music.
There are about 1,600 cinemas in Great Britain and estimated attendance in
1975 amounted to i23‘8 million. British films, actors and creative and technical
talent have received much recognition both at home and abroad, and regularly
achieve success at international film festivals and other events.

The feature film industry is based in the London area where all the main film
studios are centred. Cinema and television films are exported to most countries
in the world. The trade associations to which the majority of feature film pro¬
ducers belong is the Film Production Association of Great Britain.
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production through a
consortium formed by the corporation and private interests in 1972 and which
operates with funds drawn from the Government and private interests.1 The
corporation also administers the National Development Fund which provides
loans (£200,000 for 1976-77) for script-writing and other pre-production costs
of some British films.
There is a levy on cinema admissions which provides a fund to benefit the
makers of eligible British films. Subject to the approval of the Department of
Trade, grants from the levy can be made to the Children’s Film Foundation, to
the British Film Institute for the production of films, to the National Film
School, and to the National Film Finance Corporation. The remainder of the
fund is distributed by a public body (the British Film Fund Agency) in pro¬
portion to a film s takings, so that the more successful a film is at the box office,
the more it receives from the fund.
Under legislation dating from 1927 a specified proportion of British films must
be shown in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota has
remained at 30 per cent since 195° and for supporting programmes at 25 per
cent since 1948.
Local authorities are the only public authorities in Britain with powers to
license cinemas and censor films. They have a legal duty to prohibit the
admission of children under the age of 16 to unsuitable films, and may also
exercise censorship in respect of films for adults. In considering the suitability
of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an independent body,
the British Board of Film Censors, to which most films for public showing are
submitted (other than newsreels).
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the films
offered to the public. The board, which does not use any written code of censor¬
ship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are placed into one of
four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general exhibition but
parents are advised that the film contains material which they may not wish
children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of not less than 14
years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to 1929,
when a group of directors begah making factual films of a distinctive and
imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce high quality factual
The Government has announced its intention of implementing proposals contained in
a report published in 1976 which recommended the setting up of a British Film Authority
and the provision of financial assistance for the industry (see Bibliography, p. 472). An
advance of £2-37 million was made available through the corporation irr 1976.

films which have won numerous international awards. The British Industrial
and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in industry, science
and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associations is the trade
association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising and cartoon film
makers. The National Panel for Film Festivals assists in the selection of short
films for British entries to international short film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences overseas
about British life and achievements, including documentary films, television
programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central Office of
Information (COI), which commissions their production by private companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other countries
are available through the COI’s Central Film Library and other agencies. The
Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish films covering
the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed mainly by an Exchequer grant, and by the
Scottish Council for Educational Technology which also receives a government
grant. The institute offers financial and technical assistance both to new and
experienced film makers who cannot find support elsewhere.
The institute administers the National Film Theatre in London and the
National Film Archive and maintains a film library from which films may be
hired, a library of books on the film and an information service. It makes grants
to the Federation of Film Societies, the British Universities Film Council and
the Society for Education in Film and Television.
The National Film Archive contains about 25,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and over
1 million photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the
film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, in London, has two cinemas showing films of
outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it is unique as a cinema
offering regular programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations or by
the age or nationality of the films shown. Each year it organises a London Film
Festival. The British Film Institute has promoted the development of some
52 regional film theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and may make
grants towards their costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council, as a com¬
mittee of the Scottish Council for Educational Technology, is responsible for
regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
An independent National Film School offers three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen. The school, which is financed by grants
from the Government and the British Film Fund Agency, has about 75
students. Training in film production is also given at the London International
Film School which has over 150 students and at some polytechnics and other
institutions of further education.
Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from local
authorities which may impose conditions. There are about 575 children’s
cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An
important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film

A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been stimulated by improved methods of display by museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, and private galleries and
the growing number of local art centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants for
municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of local education
authority art education. The Government also encourages high standards of
industrial design and craftmanship through grants to the Design Council (see
p. 222).
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the Serpentine
Gallery, which mainly presents the work of young artists. The council also
maintains its own collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers
grants or guarantees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. The
Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils maintain galleries in Edinburgh, Glasgow
and Cardiff respectively. The Arts Council of Great Britain also supports art
societies and independent galleries, and provides commissions and awards for
artists. The Northern Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered by
export control: these are works of art and other antiques over 100 years old and
worth more than £4,000; documentary and photographic material over 70
years old; and British archaeological material over 100 years old. A licence is
required before such items can be exported but this is granted automatically in
the case of objects imported into Britain within the last 50 years. In other cases
the application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade, and if
the department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding of a licence, the
matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art;
i the committee regards a work to be of national importance it can advise the
Government to withhold the export licence for a specified time to enable a
public museum or art gallery to purchase the object at a fair price.
Over 950 museums and art galleries are open to the public including the major
national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions. The Government is advised on grants and policy towards
museums by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries.
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London contain between
them one of the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeo¬
logical, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city.
I hey are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the
National Maritime Museum, the Museum of London, the Wallace Collection,
the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological Museum and the
ocience Museum (see p. 402).

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. In Northern Ireland there are two
national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum, County Down.
Most of the national museums and galleries are administered by trustee
bodies, but the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the responsibility
of the Department of Education and Science, and the Royal Scottish Museum
has a similar relationship with the Scottish Education Department.
Other Collections Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s Museum. In
Buckingham Palace the Queen’s Gallery has exhibitions of pictures from the
extensive royal collections. Most cities and towns have a museum devoted to
art, archaeology and natural history, usually owned by the local authority but
sometimes by a local learned society or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford
and Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them associated with the uni¬
versities, for example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683,
the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. There
are important museums and art galleries in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham,
Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Reading,
Southampton and York. Many private art collections housed in historic
family mansions, including those owned by the National Trust, are open to the
public. An increasing number of open air museums depict the regional life
of an area or preserve early industrial remains, for example, the Weald and
Downland Museum in Sussex.
Co-operation A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to advise
the Government on the relationship between national and provincial institu¬
tions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils which
cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the Government and
offer help and advice to museums and galleries in their areas.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. It serves as a central body for the
collection of information and discussion of matters relating to museum adminis¬
tration, and as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Exhibitions Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Art Exhibitions
Bureau and the area museum councils are a regular feature of many museums.
In London the Hayward Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Academy are the main centres for
loan exhibitions; these are also held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the
Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. The Greater
London Council periodically exhibits modern sculpture in its parks. Com¬
mercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held in the
galleries of the London dealers.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
THE ARTS

notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
children’s exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting administrative and maintenance costs, the Government provides
annual purchase grants (^3'4 niillion in i97^~77)' It also provides special
purchase grants. Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the Government in
place of capital transfer tax are allocated to public collections.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, can be helped in building up their collections through the annual
government grant administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal
Scottish Museums. Financial help and practical assistance is also given to
museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies, particularly the
National Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, colleges of
further education and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department. University
art schools include the Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College
(London), the Ruskin Drawing School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art,
the Department of Fine Art of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the
School of Art of University College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the
Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland three-year full-time courses
leading to a degree in art and design are administered by the Council for
National Academic Awards (CNAA). The CNAA also awards postgraduate
degrees in art and design. In Scotland each of the four schools of art awards a
diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass degree of a university, and
three award associateships which are comparable with an honours degree. The
Ulster College is the regional college for Northern Ireland.
Art has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through
Art encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition. Pictures
may also be borrowed from many public libraries.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £730,000 in 1976-77, are
administered by the Crafts Advisory Committee. Set up in 1971 to advise the
minister responsible for the arts on the needs of artist-craftsmen, the com¬
mittee also promotes exhibitions of work and gives financial assistance to
enable craftsmen to be trained and to establish or expand their businesses. Its
activities include crafts associated with conservation and renovation. Scotland
receives a separate government grant which is similarly administered by the
Joint Crafts Committee.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and conserving the best that has been
inherited from the past (for conservation, see p. 169).
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and help
to promote good design. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for the design, building and maintenance work of government departments and
undertakes research and development work. It also provides advice to local
authorities in England and Wales on standards of housing design through a
series of Design Bulletins and other publications. Annual awards are made in
conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects (see below) for good
housing design in both the public and private sectors. Other government
departments, for example, the Department of Education and Science and the
Department of Health and Social Security, provide advice and exercise design
control over such buildings as schools and hospitals. In Scotland statutory
responsibility and control of standards are exercised by the Secretary of State
for Scotland.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Arts Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions exist
to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 166) seeks to
promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to encourage
interest in the appearance and protection of town and countryside. The
National Trust (see p. 165) acquires land and buildings and protects them from
harmful development for the benefit of the public.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’ unless
registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United Kingdom.
Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are 32 schools
recognised for exemption from the examination in architecture of the Royal
Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Some of these schools have part-time
courses and there are five other schools which have courses leading to the RIBA
external examination.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional archi¬
tectural institution with a membership of nearly 22,000 in Britain and almost
6,000 overseas, and over 3,400 students in Britain and overseas countries. The
RIBA has 78 branches in Britain, and allied to it are 15 architectural societies in
overseas countries. It is concerned with a wide range of activities covering pro¬
fessional practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions,
and professional and public relations; arranges lectures and discussions;
presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Education, exercises control
over standards of architectural education. The RIBA has one of the largest
and most important architectural libraries in the world. The Royal Incorpora¬
tion of Architects in Scotland with over 2,000 professional members is allied
to and acts for the RIBA in Scotland. Among other architectural bodies are the
Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Regis¬
tered Architects, the Faculty of Architects and Surveyors, the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and several which cover particular aspects
of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges and
universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private

libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on radio and there are numerous periodicals concerned
with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of
literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the
Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative
writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
Government help is given through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland which support literature in a number of ways, including
grants for writers, translators, publishers, little presses and magazines. A Bill
to give authors a public lending right entitling them to payment from public
funds for the loan of their books through public libraries is before Parliament.
The British Library was created in July 1973 under the British Library Act
1972 from a merger of the British Museum Library with other libraries and
institutions. The Library is organised in three divisions. The Reference
Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding over 8 million
titles, the Department of Manuscripts, the Department of Oriental Manu¬
scripts and Printed Books, and the Science Reference Library. The Lending
Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, has over 2-5 million volumes
including some 48,000 current periodicals available on loan to other libraries
in Britain; it also has access to many millions of books in other libraries and is
the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain and between Britain
and foreign countries. The Bibliographic Services Division processes the
acquisitions of the British Library for inclusion in its catalogues and other
bibliographic services; it publishes the British National Bibliography which lists
in a classified order (with indexes) all new books and new editions, excluding
reprints, published in Britain. The British Library automatically receives a copy
of each new book published in Britain. In addition the National Library of
Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University Library are entitled to claim copies.
The Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum (Natural History)
in London also have large libraries and many government departments have
old-established libraries of considerable size and importance. The Public
Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of most
government departments, as well as such famous historical documents as
Domesday Book. In Scotland, the Scottish Record Office serves the same pur¬
poses. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the Historical
Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the learned
societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see p. 399).
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of
Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book League.
Many libraries have collections of records and musical scores which are
available on loan to the public. The City of Westminster houses the Central
Music Library which lends to other libraries and to individuals. Another
well-known music collection is the Henry Watson Music Library at the Man¬
chester Central Library.

the colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 5-5 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains more
than 2 million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh, and Glasgow
have over 1 million volumes each, while Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool
each has some 700,000 volumes. Many universities have succeeded in building
up large and important research collections in special subjects; for example, the
Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham, and the British Library of Political and
Economic Science at the London School of Economics. Other universities are
also building collections as are the new polytechnics.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books. Schoolchildren are regularly introduced to
the public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Public Libraries Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
local public library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 115
million books (not including the libraries in publicly maintained schools).
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members of
public libraries. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible
for the supervision of the public library service in England and in Wales, and is
advised by two library advisory councils. Public library authorities in England
and Wales have a duty to provide an efficient and (with some limitations) free
lending and reference library service for books and periodicals. They maintain
more than 6,500 public library service points; some areas may be served by
mobile libraries, of which over 600 are in service, and domiciliary services
exist for people who are unable to visit a library. In Scotland local authorities
have a duty to provide library facilities, and similar duties are imposed on edu¬
cation and library boards in Northern Ireland.
In addition to lending books, about a half of the library authorities now lend
gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding loan
collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all library
authorities provide children’s departments, while reference sections and art,
music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields. Most library authorities possess a significant
collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities. Film shows,
lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramo¬
phone recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities pro¬
vided by or based upon the local library.
Library A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown up
Co-operation since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux in
England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim to be
largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books, achieved in
some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation. They organise
co-operation among themselves and through the British Library, which is
responsible for inter-library lending at national and international level.
There is a growing number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist
books and periodicals and information. These involve industrial, commercial
and sometimes university libraries and are normally centred on a major public
or technical college library.

The National Library of Scotland carries out functions similar to those of the
regional bureaux and the lending division of the British Library. In Northern
Ireland access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries is available on applica¬
tion to the libraries under the control of the five education and library boards
and to the Queen’s University and New University of Ulster libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which has a
membership of nearly 24,000, including over 2,000 from overseas. It maintains
a Register of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official
journals, and holds regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries,
for example, the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(see p. 402) ancl the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries.
In 1975 British publishers issued 35,608 separate titles: 27,247 new ones, and
8,361 reprints and new editions. An increasing proportion of books—including
a wide range of specialised non-fiction—is now sold in paper-back form. Book
clubs make available hard-backed books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through its libraries in over 60 countries, its programme of book
exhibitions (274 exhibitions were mounted in 1975-76) and its bibliographical
publications including the monthly British Book News. The Book Development
Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in
I975> see P- 239). The National Book League has a membership including
authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages an
interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and the
Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of His¬
torical, Philosophical and Philological Studies (known as the British Academy)
is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a government grant.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society and the Apollo Society are among the best known. Poetry also plays an
important part in various annual festivals, including the Royal National
Eisteddfod the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-Avon
Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the annual
poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
21 The Press
Ownership
The British press caters for a variety of political views, different levels of
education and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to state control or
censorship.
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per head of popula¬
tion in Britain than in almost any other European country, and, although
there are relatively few national newspapers, some of them have circulations
comparable with the greatest in any other part of the world; individual audited
circulation figures range from nearly 177,000 to some 3-8 million.
The national daily and Sunday newspapers are conventionally described
as either ‘popular’ (often using a tabloid format) or ‘quality’ (in broadsheet
format). There has been a slight long-term decline in newspaper circulation;
but this trend conceals the experiences of individual newspapers and the fact
that, while the circulation of the popular press as a whole has declined fairly
steadily over the years, that of the quality press has generally increased..
Prices of newspapers range from ^0-05 to £0-12 for dailies and from ^o-oq
to ^0-18 for Sundays. Separate sections or pages on finance, business, industry,
education, the arts, social services and sport are common, and some papers
carry special supplements on particular subjects, with related advertising.
The quality Sunday newspapers have separate sections for literature and the
arts, business and industry, as well as colour magazine supplements. Free
colour magazine supplements are published by the Sunday Telegraph, The
Sunday Times and The Observer.
According to the 1976 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory 134 daily
and Sunday newspapers and 1,091 weekly newspapers are published in
Britain. These figures include certain specialised papers, the circulation of
which is limited not by region, but by interest; for instance, business news¬
papers, sporting newspapers, newspapers in foreign languages for people of
other countries resident in Britain and religious newspapers.
Newsprint forms 35 per cent of the costs of popular papers and 28 per cent
of that of qualities. Three-quarters of Britain’s requirements, about one million
tonnes annually, are imported while the rest is made mainly from imported
raw materials.
Newspaper ownership in Britain, as it affects the national daily and Sunday,
London evening and regional daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the
hands of a comparatively small number of large press publishing groups.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The seven major newspaper
and periodical publishers are: Reed Publishing Holdings Ltd. (part of Reed
International); Associated Newspapers Ltd.; Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd.;
the Thomson Organisation Ltd.; News International Ltd.; United News¬
papers Ltd.; and Pearson Longman Ltd.
The large national newspaper and periodical publishers are major corpora¬
tions with diversified interests over the whole field of publishing and com¬
munications ; some have shares in independent television and radio contracting
companies.

Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and
their political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party and are not obliged to follow any specific party line. (The one
exception is the Morning Star which is owned by a co-operative society and
expresses the views of the Communist Party of Great Britain.) In order to
preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are
governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees,
or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer
of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have management arrangements
intended to ensure the authority and independence of editors.
Safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentration of the means
of communication are provided in certain Acts of Parliament, for instance, in
the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973, which stipulates that, if it
appears to the Independent Broadcasting Authority at any time that news¬
paper shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are
leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the authority may,
with the consent of the Home Secretary', notify the companies that their
programmes may cease to be transmitted. The Act makes a similar stipulation
for local independent radio and provides that if a local newspaper has a
monopoly in the area, it should not be allowed to have a controlling interest
in the local radio station. In addition, the Fair Trading Act 1973 makes
unlawful any transfer of a newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting,
with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies unless
the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection gives written
consent. Except in certain limited cases, which include transfers of very small
newspapers, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State has re¬
ferred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received
its report.
A Royal Commission on the press is inquiring into factors affecting the
maintenance of the independence, diversity’ and editorial standards of news¬
papers and periodicals, and the choice of newspapers and periodicals available
to the public nationally’, regionally and locally. The commission is expected
to publish its final report early7 in 1977, but an interim report on the financial
problems facing the national newspaper industrv was published in March
I97^ (see Bibliography, p. 473). This concluded that there was no immediate
prospect of increasing newspapers’ revenue and that the only adequate
means of cost-saving would be to secure higher productivity through reduc¬
tions in manpower and the introduction of new technology’ in production
methods. The Government has accepted this conclusion and has agreed with
the commission’s view that a general subsidy to enable the press to carry
out such measures would be inappropriate.
Nine morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the
British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 37). All
the national dailies are produced in London, but five also print northern
editions in Manchester. The Scottish Daily Express and the Scottish Sunday
Express are printed in ^Manchester. The leading Scottish quality papers
[The Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circulation
outside Scotland. Each of the (two) London evening papers has ownership
affiliations with a national daily’, but both have their distinctive style and draw
their readership very largely from people living in and around London.

The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 87 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and 707 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. Some of the daily newspapers also
give coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their
own foreign news service. The leading regional newspapers have wide
regional circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.

The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is esti¬
mated at over 6 million. Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds)
and the Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over 100,000 and
two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and
the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over 150,000.
Individual circulation figures of regional evening papers start at about 18,000;
most are in the 30,000-10,000 range, although the Manchester Evening News
has a circulation of over 300,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal;
they are also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations
in the 5,000-40,000 range.
There is also a growing number of free distribution advertising news¬
papers (mostly weekly), some of which are published by orthodox news¬
paper publishers.
The London local weeklies (120) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They circulate in as many as six to eight local editions of individual
papers, affiliated in some cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; its circulation of 95,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales Argus,
Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening Leader,
Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 19,000 and 126,000. North Wales
is also served by the Liverpool Echo, the Shropshire Star covers parts of mid
and north Wales and there is coverage to a smaller extent by the Manchester
Evening News.
The weekly press (74 papers) includes English language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 90,000 and 660,000, are The
Scotsman, published in Edinburgh; The Glasgow Herald and the Daily Record,
published in Glasgow; the Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; the
Press and Journal of Aberdeen; and the Scottish Daily Express. The evening
papers have circulations in the range of 17,000 to 216,000 and are the Evening
News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph
and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the
Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post
and the Scottish Sunday Express.
Weekly and local newspapers published in Scotland number 129, of
which the Hamilton Advertiser and the Falkirk Herald have the largest
circulations.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 50,00010
170,000. They are The Nezvs-Letter (Unionist) and the Irish News (Nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News.
There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland of which the majority
are published by individual companies.

Channel
Islands and
Isle of Man
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey) and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney and Sark.
In the Isle of Man there are 5 weekly newspapers of which the Isle of
Man Examiner has the largest circulation.
The There are over 4,300 periodical publications in Britain, classified as ‘general’,
Periodical ‘specialised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’.-There are also about 635
Press ‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or
public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Radio Times)
TV Times) Woman’s Weekly) Woman's Own) Woman) Weekend) and
Woman's Realm. The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a politi¬
cally independent publication covering topics from a wider angle than its title
implies; the New Statesman, which is a review of politics, literature and the
arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator, which
covers much the same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint;
Tribune, which represents the views of the left-wing of the Labour Party; New
Society, which covers the sociological aspects of current affairs; and New
Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and technology in terms
which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally the leading
humorous periodical, also devotes attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industry. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a con¬
siderable circulation overseas and are an important medium for selling British
goods. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout the United Kingdom.
In Wales there are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in
both Welsh and English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated
periodicals, a weekly paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary
journals (of which the most famous is probably Blackwood's), and numerous
popular magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly
publications covering farming, the linen industry, building, motoring,
politics and social work.
New Technology New techniques are available in'all the stages of newspaper production, but
the national newspapers published in Britain are generally proposing to
concentrate investment in the composing and plate-making processes. The
introduction of new technology in these departments involves computerised
photocomposition in place of linotype machine composition, and substitutes
electronic and chemical methods of plate-making for manual.
News Agencies
THE PRESS
These methods allow savings to be made with newspapers’ labour costs
and have so far been adopted mainly by the provincial press where composing
represents a very high proportion of total costs. Most national newspaper
publishers, however, are now preparing to introduce systems drawing on all
techniques available, and the Daily Mirror, the Financial Times, The Daily
Telegraph, The Guardian and The Times have announced plans.
There are three principal British news agencies: Reuters Ltd.; the Press
Association Ltd.; and the Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd. is a world news organisation. It has four shareholders—the
Newspaper Publishers Association, the Press Association, the Australian
Associated Press and the New Zealand Press Association, which are parties
to a trust agreement to safeguard the independence and integrity of the news
service. Founded in Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851,
Reuters now has about 1,100 correspondents in 183 countries and territories,
and links with 120 national or private news agencies, which give it access to
coverage by many thousands of local reporters. Som e 700,000 words of
general news, sports, and economic reports are received in London every day
and are retransmitted to 153 countries and territories over a global network
of leased teleprinter lines, satellite links and cable and radio circuits. These
news services are specially tailored to the needs of recipients in Britain and
overseas, and are distributed to information media, either direct or through
national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services, one of the world’s
largest financial and business news services, supplies information to business
houses throughout the world by means of computer-based video display
units, teleprinters and bulletins.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner)
and other international agencies with a complete service of home news, includ¬
ing general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in Fleet Street over a network of lines leased from the
Post Office—certain items being available in teletypesetting form. Through
its photographic department the Press Association serves London and
regional newspapers with a daily picture service from home and overseas;
these are wired to the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies
reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals.
All profits are used to develop the service.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Exchange Tele¬
graphy Company (Holdings) Ltd., a public company. It supplies financial
and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations. In con¬
junction with the Press Association Ltd., racing services are also supplied
by teleprinter and telephone to subscribers in London and the provinces from
offices in all important cities and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Asso¬
ciated Press Ltd., and by United Press International, which are British
subsidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,

mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
Training for The Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) is responsible
Journalism for training in the printing, publishing and professional photography indus¬
tries. Its work includes the formulation of training schemes, the establishment
of standards, ensuring that adequate facilities exist, and the provision of a
regional advisory service.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), composed of
the major representative organisations in journalism and the press, works in
partnership with the PPITB. Its functions include superintending activities
concerning entry into journalism, setting and conducting examinations; and
organising short training courses and seminars for journalists.
There are two normal methods of entry to newspaper journalism: (1) by
selection for a place on a full-time pre-entry course lasting for one academic
year and (2) by direct recruitment to a regional or local newspaper. Under
collective agreements between the employers’ associations in publishing, the
National Union of Journalists and the Institute of Journalists, systematic
training under NCTJ arrangements is obligatory for all entrants to the regional
and local newspaper publishing sector under the age of 31. The scheme
consists of on-the-job training, and block-release courses for those who have
not attended a pre-entry course. A similar syllabus covering practical journal¬
ism, use of language, law, public administration and current affairs is used at
both kinds of course.
Both the PPITB and the NCTJ have given attention to the development of
comparable arrangements for entrants to periodical publishing. NCTJ
accredited courses (including pre-entry) are available in central London
(where the greater part of the periodical publishing sector is situated) and the
PPITB has drawn up a recommendation on systematic training for the editorial
staff of periodicals to facilitate the preparation of in-company schemes which
now exist in most major groups.
While most training in journalism in Britain takes place at below university
level and there are no courses offering degrees in journalism, the Centre for
Journalism Studies at the University College, Cardiff, has a one-year post¬
graduate diploma course in journalism which is available to any holder of a
degree from a British university or a recognised equivalent. In addition a wide
range of training courses, covering circulation, advertising, industrial relations
and supervisory management are provided for the regional newspaper industry
by the Newspaper Society Training Service and for the national newspapers
by the Newspaper Publishers Association. Short general management courses
are also run in conjunction with the University of Aston in Birmingham.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Harry Brittain Memorial Fellow¬
ship Scheme for the training and education of young journalists throughout
the Commonwealth, about eight journalists from overseas spend three months
in the United Kingdom each year, partly in the offices of newspapers or periodi¬
cals and partly acquiring a general idea of life in Britain. A limited number of
travelling scholarships are also awarded to British journalists to enable them
to visit Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation offers scholarships and organises training courses
for journalists from all over the world at its Editorial Studies Centre in Cardiff,
and provides consultants and tutors for courses for journalists overseas.

The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the journalists’ side there are the
Institute of Journalists (IOJ), founded in 1884, and the National Union of
Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907. All practising journalists (including those
engaged in radio, television, public relations and freelance journalism) are
eligible for membership of either of these organisations. The NUJ has 29,500
members and the IOJ about 2,300.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to maintain
the professional status and independence of editors, defend the freedom of
the press, and improve the education and training of journalists: the guild,
which is not a trade union, has about 400 members. The British Association of
Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to which most editors of
house journals belong.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 30 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in accor¬
dance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep under
review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of public
interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of the
press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to report
on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater con¬
centration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions to
the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. The council publishes annual reports, which include
statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles examin¬
ing the structure of the leading press groups.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty
to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; the drawing up between employers and unions
of ‘closed shop’ membership agreements,1 restrictions on the reporting of
1 In order to safeguard the interests of journalists, contributors and others involved in
writing newspaper articles, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act
1976 provides for the drawing up of a charter containing practical guidance on matters
affecting the freedom of the press. If the industry does not present such a charter within
a specified time, the Secretary of State for Employment is empowered to produce one,
after consultation with the industry and subject to the approval of Parliament.
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
preliminary hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland); the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local
authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) divorce and domestic pro¬
ceedings in courts of law, (6) legal proceedings involving children, (c) advertise¬
ment and investment circulars, which are governed by Acts dealing with the
publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods and services and with
fraud, and (d) advertisements of remedies for certain diseases, which are
covered by public health legislation; agreements between the Post Office and
newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications, which must comply
with telegraphs legislation; retrictions on certain types of prize competition;
and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on defamation
and contempt of court. A newspaper may not publish comments on the
conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their reputation
for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it publish before
or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the result. The
obtaining and publication of information from state and official sources of a
confidential or security nature is affected by the Official Secrets Acts. News¬
papers are also liable to proceedings for seditious libel and incitement to
disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
22 Broadcasting
Broadcasting
Authorities
The British
Broadcasting
Corporation
Broadcasting by television and radio in Britain is regulated by the Home
Secretary under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967, which prohibit
the sending or receiving of wireless communications, except under licence.
Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—are licensed to provide television
and radio broadcasting services. The BBC, which was established by Royal
Charter in 1927, operates two national television services, four national radio
services and 20 local radio stations; it also broadcasts to countries abroad
through its external services division. The IBA, originally established in 1954
as the Independent Television Authority, controls the operation of the single
independent television service and has similar responsibility for the independent
local radio stations (see p. 435).
The BBC and the IBA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government retains ultimate control, and the Home Secretary is answerable to
Parliament on broad questions of policy and may issue directions to the BBC
and IBA on a number of technical and other subjects. The intention has always
been, however, to maintain as far as possible the independence of the broad¬
casting authorities while ensuring that they retain a balanced approach to their
responsibilities. Periodic committees of inquiry, which have reported either on
particular aspects of broadcasting or on the subject as a whole, have reflected
the need for constant review of the role of the broadcasting authorities and for
change in response to new developments. A committee of inquiry appointed
by the Government in 1974, is looking into the future of broadcasting.
Users of television sets must obtain a receiving licence each year from the
Post Office. Licences for sets receiving black and white pictures cost £8 a year,
and for those receiving colour pictures £18 a year. There were nearly 17-9
million receiving licences current in Britain in June 1976 of which approxi¬
mately equal numbers were for black and white and for colour television.
Both the BBC and the IBA are constitutionally required to provide a ‘public
service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education and enter¬
tainment. The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the new
Royal Charter granted in 1964 and by the Licence and Agreement of 1969, and
those of the IBA by the Independent Broadcasting Authority Acts 1973 and
I974 and its 1973 Licence. Both organisations are required to publish annual
reports and accounts.
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman
and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland),
each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the Queen on the
advice of the Government. The governors are constitutionally responsible for
the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including the production and
presentation of the programmes on television and radio, and the provision and
working of the necessary installations and equipment. A number of committees
advise them on such matters as the social effects of television, religious broad-
432

Companies
BRITAIN 1977: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
casting, music, agriculture, schools broadcasting, further education, pro¬
grammes for immigrants, science and engineering and charitable appeals.
There is also a programme complaints commission. The governors appoint the
chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director General—with whom they
discuss all major matters of policy and finance. He is chairman of the BBC’s
board of management, which also includes the managing directors for tele¬
vision, radio and external broadcasting, and the directors of personnel, finance,
public affairs and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by an annual grant
voted by Parliament (£212 million in 1975-76) which is the income from the
sale of television receiving licences less certain deductions for collection and
other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities, in¬
cluding domestic sales of records, books, magazines and other publications
connected with BBC radio and television programmes, and overseas sales of
programmes. Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic
services relates to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but
some local education authorities have assisted in the making of educational
programmes.
The BBC’s external services are financed by a grant determined each year by
the Government; in 1975-76 this amounted to over £27 million.
The Independent Broadcasting Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and nine other members (three of whom have responsibility for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary. The
IB A does not itself produce programmes; these are provided by commercial
programme companies. The authority’s four main functions are to appoint the
programme companies, to supervise the programme arrangements, to control
the advertising and to build, own and operate the transmitting stations for
independent television and independent local radio.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review
Board reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the IBA’s
staff. Local advisory committees provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA is the Director General. There are also
two deputy directors general, and a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services.
The IBA receives no payments from licence revenue. The finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the television
and radio programme companies which amounted to about >£ 14’9 nnillion in the
year ended March 1975. The television programme companies also pay to the
IBA, for transfer to the Government, a further sum known as the levy which is
related to their profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions of Britain (two companies
share the contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and
BROADCASTING
433
the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commercial basis,
deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial resources,
advertising revenue and programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the size of population in their areas.
(Independent television serves a population of some 11-5 million people in the
London area compared with some 107,000 people in the Channel Islands.)
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com¬
panies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest companies
(Thames, ATY, Granada, Yorkshire and London Weekend) produce a larger
proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes for
broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones. A common
news service is provided by Independent Television News Ltd., a non-profit-
making company in which all the programme companies are shareholders. The
negotiations concerning the supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and
their co-ordinated transmission through the independent television network
take place largely on the Network Planning Committee which consists of
representatives of all the programme companies and of the IBA.
Local broadcasting by independent radio stations has been introduced by the
IBA. The companies providing programmes are under contract to the IBA,
operate under its control and are financed by advertising revenue.
Control by
the IBA
Domestic
Television
and Radio
When a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to the
IBA for approval. The authority has wide-ranging powers to control and regulate
the content and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that a ‘proper
balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn up a code on violence which
includes special precautions to be taken when children are likely to be viewing.
Although newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies there
are safeguards to prevent their shareholdings leading to results contrary to the
public interest. In certain circumstances local newspapers have a right to a
share in the control of local radio companies.
Television viewing has become by far the most popular leisure activity in
Britain and some 95 per cent of the population have television in their own
homes. Average viewing time per head of population in the first three months of
1976 was over 19 hours a week. There are three television channels: BBC-i and
ITV which broadcast on both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines
ultra high frequency (uhf), and BBC-2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only.
Some 99 per cent of the population live within range of vhf, and more than 95
per cent within range of uhf transmissions. A majority of people possess uhf
receivers, and when most of the old vhf-only receivers have been replaced the
vhf broadcasts of BBC-i and ITV will cease. Colour programmes were first
introduced on BBC-2 in 1967 and were extended to BBC-i and ITV in 1969
when they began uhf broadcasts. A high proportion of programmes on the three
uhf services is transmitted in colour, though they can also be received in
black and white.
The Government has accepted in principle the recommendation of a report
on broadcasting coverage (see Bibliography, p. 473) that a fourth television
channel in Wales should be allotted to a separate service in which Welsh-
language programmes would be given priority.

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Radio attracts its largest audiences during the mornings. In the first three
months of 1976 radio listening averaged almost 8-5 hours a week per head of
population.
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. Since 1964 it has operated two services—
BBC-1 and BBC-2. All BBC-2 programmes and the majority of those on BBC-i
are broadcast on the national network. Although many nationally networked
programmes are produced in London, some originate from regional studios in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and eight regional centres in England. In
1974-75 some 4,997 hours were broadcast on the BBC-i national network
including 786 hours of programmes produced by regional organisations for
network transmission; similar figures for BBC-2 were 3,494 hours including
381 hours of regional productions. Regional studios also originate programmes
of news and local interest intended for regional transmission only; these varied
from 684 hours in Wales (of which 350 were in the Welsh language) to an
average of over 170 hours in each of the eight English regions.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC-i presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while BBC-2 places
greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger element of news,
documentaries, serious drama and music. Programmes successful on BBC-2
are frequently repeated on BBC-i. Both channels provide a wide range of
education programmes; in 1974-75 nearly 11 per cent of BBC-i transmissions
were devoted to schools and further education broadcasts and over 23 per cent
of BBC-2 transmissions to Open University programmes (see p. 154).
During 1974-75 BBC television programmes won ten international awards.
In the financial year 1975-76, some 9,000 hours of programmes were sold to
80 countries, the most popular being David Copperfield which was screened in
27 countries.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV transmissions are provided on a regional basis by 15 programme com¬
panies. In 1974-75 over 9>300 hours of different programmes were shown over
the independent television network: 7,500 hours were produced in the com¬
panies’ own studios of which two-thirds were programmes designed for regional
audiences (including news and magazine programmes) and the remainder
were networked throughout the country.
ITV programmes cover the whole range of television output, and more than
one-third of viewing time is devoted to serious programmes such as news and
news magazines, current affairs and documentaries, religion and education.
The remainder includes a high proportion of drama (often in serial form), light
entertainment, music, sport and feature films. There are about three short
advertising intervals an hour, during and between programmes.
During 1974-75 programmes produced by independent television companies
won 16 international awards. Of the individual companies, ATV Network
Ltd., for instance, sold some £12 million worth of programmes overseas, and
London Weekend Television Ltd. gained over £750,000 from overseas sales.
BBC Radio provides listeners with four separate national channels, each of
which has a distinct character. Radio 1 provides a programme of ‘pop’ music,
BROADCASTING
435

Services
while Radio 2 provides light music as well as being the principal channel for the
coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides mainly classical music (much of which is in
stereo) and in the evening offers, in addition, adult education programmes and
works of artistic and intellectual interest. Radio 4 is the main speech pro^
gramme, providing the principal news and information service of the BBC; in
addition it presents a wide range of drama, music, talks and entertainment
programmes as well as broadcasts to schools.
Local radio was started by the BBC as an experiment in eight towns in 1967
and there are now 20 stations. Broadcasting on vhf and the medium waveband,
the stations provide an average of 9 hours of locally produced programmes
each day, normally during the early morning, lunch-time and early evening
periods. During the rest of the day they transmit programmes from the BBC’s
national networks. Local broadcasts provide a comprehensive service of local
news and information, besides covering local arts and sports activities and
offering residents opportunities to air their views on subjects of local interest.
Much of the output of the independent local radio stations comprises entertain¬
ment programmes but they are also expected to provide a national and local
news service, information, and programmes on local affairs and community
activities. The first two began broadcasting in London in October 1973;
Capital Radio provides a general entertainment service while a specialist news
and information service is broadcast by the London Broadcasting Company
whose associated company, Independent Radio News, supplies national and
international news to the other independent stations. Altogether 19 stations
were on the air by September 1976.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas. The main objectives of BBC
external broadcasts are to give unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to
project British life and culture. The BBC broadcasts in 39 languages (including
English) for a total of some 705 hours a week. News bulletins, current affairs
programmes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes form
the main part of the output. A full service of sports commentaries and results,
all kinds of music, drama, and a wide range of general entertainment pro¬
grammes are also included.
The languages in which the external services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from
this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in deter¬
mining the content of news and other programmes.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa.
The foreign language services are divided into areas, namely, the African,
Arabic, Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 63 hours a week in Arabic to 35 minutes in Maltese. The
BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive language
teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast weekly by
radio with explanations in 26 other languages, and recorded lessons are supplied
to some 280 stations in 90 countries. English by Television programmes are
shown in more than 60 countries.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the

BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcription
Service offers programmes to some no countries.
Another part of the external services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the press, and the Government.
The BBC external services are complemented by the radio services of the
Central Office of Information (COI) which produce a range of material for
transmission by radio stations overseas. In addition, COI television services
provide material such as documentary and magazine programmes for distri¬
bution to overseas television stations.
The BBC’s domestic television and radio services operate from nearly 700
transmitters, and its external services from some 49 transmitters sited in
Britain and 14 overseas. Most of the circuits used to link studios and trans¬
mitters are rented from the Post Office. For its domestic radio programmes, the
BBC uses 101 studios in London and the regions, and for its external services
52 in London. In addition, there are semi-automatic studios which can be
operated by programme officials without engineering staff. Each BBC local
radio station has at least two studios. BBC television productions come from
main studios at the Television Centre in west London and other studios in
various parts of London, and from fully equipped regional studio centres at
Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. There are
also television studios at Aberdeen, Bangor, Edinburgh, Leeds, Newcastle,
Norwich, Plymouth and Southampton. Outside broadcasting is covered by a
number of mobile units.
The IBA is responsible for a total of more than 300 television and sound
radio transmitting stations throughout Britain, programme links being rented
from the Post Office. Independent television programmes are produced at
studio centres in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle,
Dover, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester, New¬
castle, Norwich, Plymouth, St. Helier and Southampton. The establishment
of these studios is the direct result of the I BA’s policy of encouraging the
development of regional television, and the programmes are designed for
either local broadcasting or for transmission on the national network. All
companies have facilities for colour transmission.
The BBC avoids giving publicity to any individual firm or organised interest by
mentioning its name or branded products, except when it is necessary in order
to provide effective and informative programmes. Under the terms of its
licence and agreement it must not broadcast sponsored programmes nor,
without the consent of the Home Secretary, broadcast any matter for payment.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television and independent
local radio subject to the relevant provisions in the Independent Broadcasting
Authority Act 1973, in particular that there should be no sponsoring of pro¬
grammes by advertisers, that all advertisements should be clearly distinguish¬
able as such and recognisably separate from the programme, and that the
amount of time given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from the
value of the programmes as a medium of information, education and enter¬
tainment. In any one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on
independent television is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over
the day’s programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent
local radio stations are normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising
BROADCASTING
437
each hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in
advertising on television and radio and giving guidance about the types and
methods of advertisement that may not be used. Some types of advertising are
prohibited, notably that with a political or religious object or on behalf of
cigarettes or betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of
programme, for example, in broadcasts to schools.
Government publicity material designed to support non-political cam¬
paigns may be broadcast on independent radio and television. It is prepared
through the COI and is broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis.
The Government has no general privileged access to radio or television. Short
public service television features on safety, health and welfare schemes are also
produced for free transmission by the BBC and the independent television
companies.
Political Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
Broadcasting proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament is in
session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news bulletins and
current affairs programmes on both radio and television. Ministerial and party
political broadcasts are transmitted periodically under rules agreed between
the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA. Both Houses of Parliament
decided in 1976 in favour of permanent radio broadcasting of their proceedings.
Technical Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
Developments staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, the Post Office, the Government,
and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the electronic
conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between the Euro¬
pean and the American systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision
system known as ‘sound-in-syncs’ which enables the television sound and
picture to be carried over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the
operational complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. IBA
engineers were the first in the world to introduce a fully digital field rate stand¬
ards converter (DICE) to improve the interchange of programmes between
areas using the 525-lines system (for example, North America) and those using
the 625-lines system (for example, Europe). The first unit was taken into
operational service by Independent Television News in 1973, and in 1974 a
‘two-way DICE’ was developed which allows conversation in both directions.
Both the BBC and IBA have produced systems which allow the broad¬
casting of written and simple graphical information to ordinary television
receivers fitted with special adaptors. In 1974 the Home Secretary approved a
two-year experimental period of broadcasting using the systems, known as
CEEFAX (BBC) and ORACLE (IBA).
International The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Relations Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that network
and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and other observations on broad¬
casting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides a large
mmaafflumwmwm

BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
amount of technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting
organisations throughout the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded
for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 134 television organisations in 94 countries and is the most widely
used newsfilm agency in the world. The BBC is also a member of the Inter¬
national Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality
information programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press Inter¬
national, Paramount Pictures and Independent Television News jointly
provide an international newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas
television organisations via the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on radio and
television training for overseas students in Britain and largely finances the
British Council (see p. 159), which includes in its activities training in educa¬
tional television and radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas.
Training in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thom¬
son Television College in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a
charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency respon¬
sible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
23 Sport and
Recreation
ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
Sports Councils
There is widespread interest in sport in Britain;, large crowds attend such
occasions as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the
international rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms
Park, the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races,
Grand Prix motor racing and the cricket Test Matches, and millions more
watch them on television. It is, however, the enthusiasm for active participa¬
tion in sport and recreation that has grown considerably in recent decades and
there is now a large variety of opportunities and facilities available. Physical
recreation (as distinct from such leisure pursuits as reading, theatre-going or
watching television) tends to be of an informal and non-competitive nature
and may include, for example, climbing, rambling, riding, and boating and
other water-based activities.
An important feature of British sport and recreation is its amateur element
(the people who devote time and energy to the organising, teaching and training
of individual activities). Although the Government is not directly concerned
with the organisation of sport and recreation, a Minister of State in the Depart¬
ment of the Environment has responsibility for the co-ordination of policies
and the promotion of research in the field of active recreation. The Secretaries
of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland exercise similar responsi¬
bilities in their countries.
The Government’s policy, outlined in the report Sport and Recreation (see
Bibliography, p. 473), is to stimulate the provision of facilities and encourage
their use to the fullest capacity. To this end it provides financial help and other
assistance through a number of official bodies. Some of these, such as the
Sports Councils (see below) and the Countryside Commission (see p. 170),
have specific responsibilities relating to sport and recreation, and assist other
public and private bodies in the provision of facilities. Others, for example, the
Forestry Commission (see p. 297), the British Waterways Board (see p. 310),
the Nature Conservancy Council (see p. 172) and the regional water authorities
(see p. 273), provide recreational amenities in addition to their main functions.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and
for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for Wales
and the Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by
the Government. The councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government (in 1976-77
amounting to some j£i3’5 million). They award grants and loans for sports
development, coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport
and to other national organisations; they pay grants to voluntary organisations
to assist in the provision of sports facilities; they assist British representatives
at international sports meetings; they encourage links with international and
^o BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
overseas organisations; and they administer national sports centres. The
Sports Council consults with the Central Council of Physical Recreation,
comprising members of the national governing and representative bodies of
sport and physical recreation in England. The Sports Council is linked with
nine regional sports councils (to be replaced by regional councils for sport and
recreation) in England on which are represented local authorities and sports
interests in each region. The Scottish Sports Council consults with the Scottish
Standing Conference of Sport which comprises representatives of the national
governing bodies of sport in Scotland; and the Sports Council for Wales
maintains, through a standing committee, a close liaison with the governing
bodies of sport in Wales.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland acts in an advisory capacity and
can assist voluntary bodies by financial contributions towards the cost of
providing equipment, coaching and instruction and in organising inter¬
national or other events. It may also provide and run national sports and
recreation centres.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documenta¬
tion Centre which has been set up by the Sports Council and is based at the
University of Birmingham; the council itself has an information centre provid¬
ing data on a wide range of sports topics at its headquarters. A similar service is
provided by the Sports Council for Wales and the Scottish Sports Council.
Voluntary There are a number of voluntary organisations whose activities are concerned
Organisations with recreation. Some, such as the Ramblers’ Association, safeguard the
interests of particular leisure pursuits; others, such as the National Trust
(see p. 165), provide for recreation in addition to their main responsibilities.
Most, however, exist to provide recreational opportunities for young people.
A description of the youth service and an outline of the work of individual
organisations is contained in Chapter 7.
Among the national voluntary bodies most closely connected with the general
development of sport and recreation are the British Olympic Association, the
National Playing Fields Association and the British Sports Association for
the Disabled.

The National

Association
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The association’s council is composed
of the British members of the International Olympic Committee, representa¬
tives of the controlling bodies of some 25 sports, representatives of the armed
services’ sports organisations and of certain other affiliated bodies concerned
with sporting activities, and a few co-opted members. It determines the size
of the British team (which competes under the name of ‘Great Britain);
raises funds; makes all the arrangements for the team s travel and comfort at
the games; organises the provision and transport of clothing and equipment;
and provides a headquarters staff for the management of the team. A total of
368 British competitors and officials went to the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
The National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) aims to stimulate the provi¬
sion of playing fields, playgrounds and local recreation centres by publicity and
technical and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925 it has distributed
over ^2*25 million in the form of grants for such centres, and over million
in the form of loans. It assists more than 400 schemes a year. The NPFA
gives advice on the provision and layout of sports facilities, including local
recreation centres, on matters relating to the recreational needs of children,

on the play and recreational needs of the handicapped, and on the establish¬
ment of playgrounds and play leadership schemes. It is a national charity
established by royal charter and derives its funds mainly from voluntary contri¬
butions (although it also receives a small Sports Council grant towards
administrative costs). It has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland and
in nearly every English and Welsh county.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The association, which
receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recrea¬
tion for the disabled, arranges sports meetings and encourages the provision
of facilities (including sports clubs) for disabled people. Regional and branch
committees of the association organise local and regional games throughout
the country. At Stoke Mandeville Hospital the first sports stadium in the world
designed for disabled people was opened in 1969, and annual games are
arranged there by the British Paraplegic Sports Society.
Increasing numbers of sporting activities receive financial sponsorship from
commercial concerns. Sponsorship may take the form of financing specific
events, or it may be granted to individual sports organisations, for example,
to provide better accommodation for spectators or to encourage more people
to participate in the sport.
A Sports Aid Foundation has been set up with responsibility for raising and
distributing funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in order to
assist the training of individual sportsmen and sportswomen. The foundation
makes grants on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. Among
the first to benefit from the scheme were members of Britain’s team for the
1976 Olympic Games.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation and their total capital expenditure on sport and outdoor
recreation in England and Wales amounted to some £56 million in 1972-73,
the last year for which full information is available. (Expenditure during 1973—
74 is estimated to have been about j£6o million.) In Scotland and Northern
Ireland, total capital investment in sports and recreation facilities by local
authorities in i973~74 was about j£ii-5 million and j£i’5 million respectively.
The facilities provided include parks, playing fields, gymnasia, tennis courts,
golf courses, boating lakes, swimming baths and multiple-use sports centres
catering for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities. The sports councils
in Great Britain have powers to support local authority projects and in 1974-75
they made grants towards capital expenditure totalling nearly fz-i million.
All publicly maintained schools in Britain are required by law to provide
for the physical education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing
and swimming) of their pupils. All (except those solely for infants) must have
a playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymna¬
sium. Some have other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and
halls designed for dance and movement. In an increasing number of areas,
physical education facilities in schools are available to the whole community
outside school hours. Sport and recreation facilities are likewise provided at
universities (some of which have departments of physical education), and a
government working party is examining the possibility of developing ‘centres
of sporting excellence at universities and other colleges which would enable
BRITAIN 1977: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
selected young athletes to develop their talents and also provide for their
educational needs.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation in national parks, nature reserves and
on waterways are provided by public bodies (see p. 171). The British Water¬
ways Board, the water authorities, and some new town development corpora¬
tions are all, for example, concerned with different aspects of water recreation
on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Research into the extent of provision
for water-based recreation is being conducted by the Water Space Amenity
Commission (see p. 273) which estimates that such activities are catered for
in about 40 of the m country parks set up in England and Wales by local
authorities with the approval of the Countryside Commission.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities,
many facilities are made available by local voluntary clubs. Some of these
cater for indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports
grounds, particularly for games such as cricket, association and rugby football,
tennis and golf. Clubs linked to industrial business firms often cater for a
wide range of activities, and in many cases make their facilities available to
members of the public. Commercial facilities, provided as profit-making
businesses, have become more numerous in recent years: there are, for
instance, tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller skating rinks, squash courts,
golf driving ranges and riding stables.
The policy of establishing sports centres, bringing together people of all ages
and different recreational interests, is an important part of the provision for
physical recreation.
National centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from
voluntary sources, are maintained by the sports councils and provide facili¬
ties and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many
recreational activities. As well as making residential courses available for
enthusiasts from all over Britain, the national sports centres are used exten¬
sively by local clubs and the community generally.
There are seven national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for ranges of sports are provided at three centres: the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey and Lilleshall National
Sports Centres in Buckinghamshire and Salop respectively. The centre at
Crystal Palace has a main stadium seating 17,000 spectators, a sports hall
seating 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic require¬
ments, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, an indoor cricket
school, practice rooms for all indoor activities, a hostel for 140 residents and
staff housing. These facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council in addition to the Sports Council grant. The other four are
specialist centres: the Plas-y-Brenin National Mountaineering Centre in
north Wales, the National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight, the Holme
Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire, and Harrison’s
Rocks, a small rock-climbing centre in Sussex. In addition there is a National
Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported by local authorities,
as well as by grants from the Welsh Sports Council.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor activities, Inverclyde at Largs
for general sports activities, and a national water sports centre in Great
Cumbrae Isle on the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres (such as the Meadow-

POPULAR SPORTS

bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh Council) cater for a wide
range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local
interest. Some 300 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national
needs; more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are
also several national centres catering for specialised interests and generally
administered by the sponsoring organisations; these include the National
Equestrian Centre, run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by
the British Paraplegic Sports Society, which was the first sports centre of its
kind in the world.
In Northern Ireland there are five indoor sports centres provided by district
councils and a Mountain Centre at Tollymore, County Down, provided by
the Sports.Council for Northern Ireland.
Some of the major sports in Britain are described below. Sportsmen may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, for example rugby union
football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but in others the distinction
between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined.
Perhaps the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate foot¬
ball associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 360 clubs are registered with the English Football Association
(FA) and some 37,000 clubs are affiliated to regional or district associations.
The principal games are controlled in England and Wales by the Football
League which comprises 92 professional clubs, and in Scotland by the Scottish
Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in England and
Wales and three in Scotland. During the season attendances at Football
League matches total about 30 million.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Football League
Cup, the Scottish FA Cup and the Scottish League Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals (four of the most important matches of the
year) are played at Wembley Stadium, London, and at Hampden Park,
Glasgow.
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against each other annually and take part in European com¬
petitions, the World Cup competition and other international matches.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board (BAAB) composed of representatives of
the national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and in
other international matches, and separate teams representing England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games. The
BAAB also administers coaching schemes.

The Highland The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
Games of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering (traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy, club and association boxing, and boxing in the armed
services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competitions, and
teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in
international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the board appoints inspectors,
medical officers and representatives to ensure that the regulations are observed
and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National
Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams which play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of Test Matches
played between England and a touring team from Australia, New Zealand,
India, Pakistan or the West Indies. The matches last five days and crowds of
up to 25,000 watch them in addition to the millions who follow the progress
of the games on television and radio. A team representing England tours one or
more of these countries in December-March. In addition to the Test Matches
there is a First Class County Championship of three-day games played by 17
county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competitions—
two of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.

The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of the most popular
field sports (hunting, game shooting and fishing) which have a long history
and play a considerable part in the life of the countryside.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most important
British hunting sport but there is also stag hunting (in Devon and Somerset),
hunting the hare, and otter hunting along river banks. The fox hunting season
lasts from early November to April and is preceded by the hunting of young
foxes when young hounds are trained. There are about 200 packs of hounds
in Britain and hunts are financed mainly by subscriptions of their members
and by steeplechase point-to-points which take place at the end of the season
and which attract large crowds.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, partridge,
pheasant, snipe and woodcock, and these species are protected by law during a
close season when they are allowed to breed in security on numerous estates
supervised by privately employed game-keepers. It is necessary to have a
licence to kill game, and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by
anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conser¬
vancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game conser¬
vation, collects information and studies factors controlling game population.
Other shooting sports are wild-fowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking.
The most popular country sport is fishing, there being about 3 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
(NFA) and many clubs organise angling competitions. A national champion¬
ship is organised by the NFA which also enters a team in the International
Angling Competition. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for; most
coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners while trout and salmon
fishermen either rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish
by the day, week or month. Coastal and deep sea fishing are free to all (apart
from salmon and sea trout fishing which is by licence only). In Northern Ire¬
land the Ulster Provincial Council of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers and
the Ulster Angling Federation look after the interests of the sport.
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is now played
throughout Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns,
some of which are owned by local authorities. The main event of the golfing
year is the Open Golf Championship; other important events include the
Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for professionals,
both of which are played between Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877- The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; these draw
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. Another important tournament is the British Hard Court Cham¬
pionships. There are also county championships and national competitions

for boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports is motor racing; the governing body
is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and the motor clubs registered with it
organise annual sporting events. The RAC issues competition licences cover¬
ing all events from hill climbs to full international race meetings. In addition
the RAC organises the British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula
One World Motor Racing Championship, and the RAC Rally which counts
towards the World Rally Championship.
Motor cycle racing is governed by the Auto Cycle Union and the most
important contest of the year is the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. Motor cycle
speedway racing is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early Novem¬
ber) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby
(for colts and fillies) run at Epsom in early June is the outstanding event in the
flat racing calendar. Other classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas (for
colts and fillies) and the One Thousand Guineas (for fillies only), both run at
Newmarket; the Oaks (for fillies) run at Epsom; and the St. Leger (for colts
and fillies) run at Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race
meeting is the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham in March. The
Grand National, run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known single
steeplechase.
The Jockey Club controls all horse racing in Britain and its rules are the
basis of universal turf procedure; it also licenses 62 racecourses in Great
Britain. Over 900 days’ racing are held each year and 11,000 horses are in
training in Great Britain.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare takes place at about no
tracks licensed by local authorities; meetings are usually held two or three
times a week at each track. Rules for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club which also licenses track officials and trainers and
promotes veterinary research. Racing can only be conducted at a licensed track
and for 130 racing days in a licensing year (1st July-30th June). Some 10,000
registered greyhounds are in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) in Great
Britain is the British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the
British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association, and runs the
National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
The British Horse Society promotes the interests of horse and pony breed¬
ing and furthers the art of riding. It provides tests, lectures, publications, a
film library, courses and examinations and, together with riding schools
approved by it, helps to promote horsemastership. With over 22,000 members,
the society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club
movement. Pony Clubs and Riding Clubs hold their own rallies, meetings and
competitions, culminating in annual national championships at the National
Equestrian Centre.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the society. The three-day events held each year—in April at Badminton,

Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association
which draws up rules for judging competitions and prescribes the general
standards and height of obstacles for show jumping. The association keeps a
register of horses and ponies taking part in affiliated shows and seeks to im¬
prove the standard of jumping and to provide for the representation of Great
Britain in international competitions. It has over 14,000 members and 900
shows are affiliated to it. The two major showjumping events each year are the
Royal International Horse Show and the Horse of the Year Show.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
football, in which there are 15 players in a team, is played by amateurs while
Rugby League football (a 13-a-side game) is played by professionals as well as
amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (in England), the Welsh Rugby Union, the Scottish Rugby
Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. International matches between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year and there
are tours by international teams.
Rugby League is played mostly in the north of England. The governing body
of the professional game is the Rugby Football League which sends touring
teams to Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against
France. The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final is the major match of the
season and is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,500 clubs and about 40,000 members.
It manages, with the Sports Council, the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in
the Isle of Wight where instructors are coached and tested; and selects the
British Olympic team. One of the world’s principal regattas takes place each
year at Cowes and major events are held at other British sailing centres.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn
to swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching
is provided in many places by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded
by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA), to which over 1,600 clubs are
affiliated. The ASA also draws up and enforces regulations for amateur
swimming, diving and water polo championships and competitions in England.
Underwater swimming (sub-aqua) is governed nationally by the British
Sub-Aqua Club which promotes underwater exploration, science and sport.
Formed in I953> the club has become the largest in the world with some 25,000
active members and more than 800 branches in Britain and overseas.
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. The governing bodies’ functions are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.
Many of the sports listed below have separate national bodies for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

BETTING AND Various forms of betting and commercial gambling are permitted under
GAMBLING strict regulations, and estimated total turnover in Great Britain in 1975 was
about £3,000 million (although consumer expenditure represented only a
small proportion of this figure).
The gambling turnover included that at casinos, on gaming machines and
on licensed bingo which is thought to be played by about 6 million people on
a fairly regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse and greyhound
racing, and on football matches (especially through football pools). The
turnover on such betting in 1975 was about £2,200 million. Racing bets may
SPORT AND RECREATION

be made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 14,000 licensed
off-course betting offices (which take about 92 per cent of the turnover). A
form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the
Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB have to
contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy Board which promotes
the advancement of veterinary science and the improvement of horseracing
and breeds of horses.
There is no national lottery in Britain, although recent legislation permits
local authorities to hold lotteries.
A Royal Commission on Gambling is inquiring into the law relating to
betting, gaming, lotteries and prize competitions. In particular it is considering
the contribution made from the proceeds of gambling towards the support
of other activities, including sport.

Annual Report:
The Sports Council
The Sports Council
Most of the organisations concerned with sport publish year books covering results and records of the
previous season and future prospects; many weekly or monthly periodicals on sport are also published.
Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main re ferences.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. (that is, Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however (for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.
