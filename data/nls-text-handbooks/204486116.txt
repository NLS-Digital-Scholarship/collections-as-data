The Office for National Statistics works in partnership with others in the Government Statistical
Service to provide Parliament, government and the wider community with the statistical information,
analysis and advice needed to improve decision-making, stimulate research and inform debate. It also
administers the registration of key life events. It aims to provide an authoritative and impartial picture
of society and a window on the work and performance of government, allowing the impact ofgovernment
policies and actions to be assessed.
Foreword
Britain 2000 is the 51st edition of an official
annual reference book that was first
published in the 1940s. Since 1997 it has
been produced by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). Drawing on a wide range of
official and other authoritative sources,
Britain 2000 provides a factual and up-to-
date overview of the state of the United
Kingdom, while also covering every aspect of
current government policy. It is a widely
used work of reference, both in the United
Kingdom itself, and overseas, where it is an
important element of the information service
provided by British diplomatic posts.
Coverage and Geographical Terms
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in Britain 2000 is accurate
at the time of going to press. The text is
generally based on information available up to
the end of August 1999.
The term ‘Britain’ is sometimes used as a
short way of expressing the full title of the
country: the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (or, more simply again,
the United Kingdom or the UK). ‘Great
Britain’ comprises England, Wales and
Scotland only. The adjectives ‘British’ and
‘UK’ have the same meaning and cover the
whole of the United Kingdom. As far as
possible, the book applies to the UK as a
whole, as the title suggests. However,
sometimes the information given refers to just:
Great Britain; England and Wales; or, in some
instances, England, Scotland, Wales or
Northern Ireland alone.
Special Features
The 51st edition has more charts and tables
than ever before, and 40 colour pages
including some new and redrawn maps. The
text is 285,000 words long and has been fully
updated and revised. Although it is the 2000
edition, it cannot be truly ‘millennial’, since
official figures are not yet available and will
follow on, as they normally do, between one
and four years after the year itself. However,
we have made historical comparisons
throughout the book (in highlighted boxes)
with life in Britain in the early part of the 20th
century. At that time official statistics were
relatively limited and additional sources have
therefore been used. There is also an
introductory chapter on the millennial
celebrations in the UK, which are remarkably
extensive, together with photographs of
Millennium Products.
One of the most significant changes to have
occurred since the publication of Britain 1999
is that the Scottish Parliament and National
Assembly for Wales are now in existence and
are exercising their responsibilities. The
separate chapters on Scotland and Wales
reflect these changes. Coverage in other
chapters has also been updated, but it is not
always possible to set out all the differences
where these exist.
The five Parts of Britain 2000 align with
their equivalents in another ONS publication,
the Annual Abstract of Statistics, so that the
two books can be consulted as complementary
volumes, painting a picture of the UK in
words and figures.
Sources
To help the reader seeking further information,
at the end of each chapter there is a brief
further reading section, which lists the main
ONS statistical publications and other
important documents, such as recent White
Papers. A selection of websites is included at
the end of most chapters. The main
government websites are listed in the entry for
Government Departments and Agencies in
Appendix 1.
ONS issues a number of important
statistical publications, many of which have

In compiling Britain 2000, information
about particular companies has been taken
only from company reports and news releases,
or from other publicly available sources. No
information about individual companies has
been taken from returns submitted in response
to ONS statistical inquiries. Very strict
arrangements operate within ONS to ensure
that such data remain confidential.
Acknowledgments
Britain 2000 has been compiled with the full
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments
and agencies. The editor would like to thank
all the people from these organisations who
have taken so much time and care to ensure
that the book’s high standards of accuracy
have been maintained. Their contributions
and comments have been extremely
valuable.
The book was researched, written and
edited by a combination of in-house authors
and freelances. The main in-house team
comprised Nigel Pearce, John King, Derek
Tomlin, David Harper, Conor Shipsey, Paul
Webb and John Chrzczonowicz; individual
chapters were also written by Catherine Hill
and Craig Myers. The freelance writers were
Henry Langley, Richard German (who also
compiled the index), John Collis and Oliver
Metcalf, and most of the design work,
including the maps and colour sections, was
done by Ray Martin. Jane Howard, Jole
Cosgrove and Rosemary Hamilton proofread
the text. The cover was designed by The
Stationery Office.

The Millennium in the UK
The United Kingdom’s plans to celebrate the millennium are among the most ambitious in the
world. More than £2 billion of proceeds from the National Lottery have been devoted to projects
and award schemes all over the country, which will ensure that a lasting legacy remains once the
celebrations are over.
Although the year 2000, according to traditional dating, marks two millennia of Christian faith
since the birth of Jesus Christ, it is of great significance to all people—religious and secular alike—
who use the Gregorian calendar. The UK today is a multi-faith society, and the Government wants
to make the celebrations equally relevant and accessible to people of all faiths and none.1
In 1994 it set up the Millennium Commission, one of the ‘good causes’ funded by National
Lottery proceeds (see p. 122), to help communities throughout the UK celebrate the year 2000.
Since then the Commission has been distributing funds to four main areas: the Millennium
Experience, centred on Greenwich in London; the nationwide Millennium Festival of events; the
Millennium Awards to individuals; and a programme of major capital projects around the country.
The Millennium Experience
The Millennium Experience consists of the ‘experience’ itself at the Millennium Dome in
Greenwich and an associated National Programme of events and activities. Both are being
organised and delivered by a public sector company especially set up for the purpose in 1997—
the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC)—whose budget is £758 million. This is
made up of a Lottery grant of £399 million from the Millennium Commission and a forecast
income of £359 million from private sector sponsorship, visitor revenues and other forms of
commercial income.
The Dome itself is the biggest such structure ever built. It is one kilometre in circumference
and has 80,000 square metres of floor space. Inside it is divided into 14 exhibition zones,
sponsored by such well-known companies as BT, Marks & Spencer, and Tesco. By June 1999 the
NMEC had exceeded its sponsorship target of £150 million, the largest amount of sponsorship
ever raised for any single event in the UK. The 14 zones are:
• Body
• Faith
• Home Planet
• Journey
• Talk
• Learning
• Living Island
• Mind
• Money
• Work
• Play
• Rest
• Self Portrait
• Shared Ground
The Body Zone, for example, which is sponsored by Boots, includes the largest ever representation
of the human form, measuring 64 metres from elbow to foot and 27 metres high. Visitors will be
able to travel inside the body, viewing exhibits on medical discoveries, lifestyle, health and beauty.
The Mind Zone, sponsored by British Aerospace and GEC, explores the human brain, senses and
perceptions through a combination of traditional art and advanced technology.
In addition, the 500-seat ‘Our Town Stage’ will host performances from more than 200
different UK towns and cities, and from countries around the world. Outside the Dome,
1 The plans of the religious communities for the millennium in the UK are described in more detail in chapter 15, p. 246.
ix
BRITAIN 2000
‘Skyscape’ will consist of two 2,500-seat cinemas by day (one of which can convert into a 3,300-
seat venue for concerts and other live events), and visitors will be able to enjoy a specially
commissioned half-hour film of Blackadder, which will reunite the original cast of the 1980s
comedy show and feature a series of cameos by famous international stars.
The Dome will be opened by HM The Queen on 31 December 1999. Over 12 million people
are expected to visit the Dome before it closes on 31 December 2000. The Millennium Experience
could contribute an additional £300-£500 million of overseas tourist revenue to the UK economy
and create 10,000-15,000 new tourist-related jobs. The public will have many means of public
transport available to them to reach the site. London Underground’s Jubilee Line Extension links
the Dome to central London (see photographs between pp. 484 and 485), and the NMEC has
constructed a new pier for river buses and ferry services from central London and historic
Greenwich. In addition, there will be a park and ride facility at Woolwich, and a bus transit link to
the North Kent Rail line (Charlton station). An on-site coach park was completed by April 1999.
The Dome has been built on a large tract of previously derelict land on the Greenwich
peninsula, an eyesore for more than 20 years. But the regeneration of the area does not stop there.
Seven of the most deprived boroughs in the UK surround the Dome site, and current plans also
include the construction on adjacent land of 5,000 new homes, a business district, and industrial
and retail developments.
The Millennium Experience does not, however, by any means confine itself to London. 1 he
NMEC has 12 regional offices throughout the UK whose staff are working with voluntary
groups, schools, churches, local authorities and businesses to get everyone involved in the
National Programme of activities. For example, over 90,000 schoolchildren have already
composed and submitted their songs for the millennium as part of a unique music project called
Voices of Promise, sponsored by Marks & Spencer. The same company is supporting an
imaginative fundraising campaign, called the Children’s Promise, in which the nation s workforce
is being asked to give the value of their final hour s earnings of this millennium to help the
children of the next. The idea is being taken up around the world. Meanwhile, the nationwide
Our Town Story project, sponsored by McDonald’s, will feature more than 200 British towns in
the Dome on different days of the year 2000.
The Millennium Festival
The Millennium Festival Fund is providing £100 million to enable people throughout the UK to
celebrate the millennium with a programme of events at national, regional and local level, in
partnership with the NMEC. The scale, number and variety of celebrations will be the greatest
since the Queen’s Silver Jubilee in 1977, and will also include sporting and artistic activities, and
religious, charitable and heritage events throughout the year 2000. 4 he Millennium Commission
is contributing £25 million towards the Fund, and other National Lotter) distributors for good
causes’ (the Arts Councils, Sports Councils, Heritage Lottery Fund and National Lottery
Charities Board) are providing the rest.
Many events are planned for the millennium weekend itself. F or example, an initiative has
been launched to help local communities to light Millennium Beacons at over 2,500 locations.
Church bells will ring all around the UK and many churches will be floodlit. Some of the largest
celebrations will be in the four capitals and other major cities.
• The focus of Liverpool’s New Year’s Eve event is to be the Pier Head, by the Royal Liver
building, where there will be a large-scale musical festival with special lighting and laser
displays. The River of Light Initiative will illuminate prominent buildings on both sides of
the river, constructing light and water bridges across the Mersey and staging ‘light
spectaculars’ with water screens in docks near the millennium eve parties.
• The ‘Millennium Dawn’ will launch Dundee’s year-long millennial celebrations on
hogmanay (New Year’s Eve). A laser-lit son et lumiere depicting Dundee’s heritage will
THE MILLENNIUM IN THE UK
herald the year 2000, and live entertainments are planned throughout the city centre. A
week-long festival will follow, featuring performances from a complete cross-section of the
community—including schoolchildren, disabled groups and ethnic minorities.
• The centrepiece of Swansea’s first weekend celebrations will be a Bio-Diversity Carnival as
part of the Green Futures Eco-Festival, which will comprise demonstration projects and
exhibits. Costumes, masks and giant puppets depicting plants, animals and habitats are being
made by volunteers and schools, with help from local artists, for a procession through the
city centre on New Year’s Eve, accompanied by a firework display.
• Londonderry/Derry City Council in Northern Ireland is planning a two-day city-wide
outdoor extravaganza to mark the first weekend of the third millennium. The city’s chosen
theme (‘Derry—Londonderry 2000 Living Our Lives’) will be reflected in a range of events
involving local, national and international figures, and will include a cross-border dimension
with the Irish Republic. Beacons will be lit throughout the Council area, culminating in
‘a procession of light’ to the city’s famous 17th century city walls.
Millennium Awards
The Millennium Commission has allocated £200 million for a scheme to provide individuals with
bursaries that will allow them to fulfil a personal aspiration while bringing benefit to their local
communities. On successful completion of their project, they become members of the
Millennium Awards Fellowship.
The awards, ranging from about £2,000 to £15,000, are made through organisations with a
strong track record in grant-making. These organisations are known as Millennium Award
Partners. By June 1999, £60 million had been offered to 57 schemes, offering opportunities to
20,000 individuals across the UK. In June alone over 4,000 individuals were taking part in
schemes promoting, among other things, science and technology, the arts, conservation, health,
education and religious understanding. Awards have been given to set up a community radio
station, for instance, drama workshops, pond construction, a bowls project, and research into
contemporary attitudes about, and knowledge of, Islam. By the year 2004 more than 40,000
people will have participated in one of over 100 award schemes. So far the youngest award winner
has been 12 years old and the oldest 92. Among other examples:
• A couple from Louth in Lincolnshire both received a £3,300 Arthritis Care Millennium
Volunteer Award. The awards enabled them to participate in a unique training programme

• A local development officer from Alloway in South Ayrshire received an award of £2,605
through the Millennium Forest for Scotland Millennium Awards. First of all she engaged
young people in woodland and environmental issues by exploring traditional tales of
woodlands and trees. She then helped them to use multimedia and theatre workshop
techniques to present the information they had gathered to the local community in
Dalmellington, through performances at local community groups and schools.
• A university lecturer received a Techniquest/PanTecnicon Millennium Award of £10,170
to create posters for display by bus companies operating in Cardiff that would stimulate
passengers’ interest in science. Having been inspired by the successful ‘Poems on the
Underground’ poster campaign in London, he designed a number of posters which intrigued
bus passengers with their eye-catching information about the science behind topics which
were already familiar to them.
• An international computer systems analyst from Enniskillen has received an award of £2,950
through the Building Sustainable Communities Millennium Award Scheme. She wants to

BRITAIN 2000
create a community-led organisation committed to redeveloping a sense of identity for
Enniskillen and creating a vision for its future. She will set up a preliminary website,
distribute flyers, hold presentations and convene three open meetings to discuss her
proposals across the communities living in the town.
Capital Projects
By September 1999 the Millennium Commission had awarded grants totalling £1.26 billion to
187 capital projects at 3,037 sites across the UK. These range from village greens and community
halls in rural locations around the country, to major flagship projects such as the new national
stadiums in Scotland and Wales, and the new Tate Gallery in Bankside, London. Nearly
everyone in the UK lives within about 30 miles (48 kilometres) of the site of a millennium capital
project. The following are examples of larger projects, one from each country:
The Norfolk and Norwich Millennium Project
Total cost £61 million; Millennium Commission grant £30 million
This project links three facilities—a Millennium Library, a Business and Learning Centre and a
Heritage Attraction—around a new urban square, creating a major new civic meeting place within
the historic city centre of Norwich. The complex will also include a multimedia auditorium, a
learning shop and a range of cafe bars and restaurants.
Millennium Link, Forth & Clyde and Union Canals
Total cost £78.4 million; Millennium Commission grant £32.2 million
This project will reopen the Forth & Clyde Canal and the Union Canal to navigation, linking not onl\
Scotland’s major east and west coast rivers, but also the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Obstacles
such as infilled sections and low bridges will be removed, locks refurbished and a transfer mechanism,
the Millennium Wheel, will be built to allow boats to pass between the two canals at Falkirk.
The National Botanic Garden of Wales
Total cost £43.4 million; Millennium Commission grant £21.7 million
A national botanic garden and research centre for Wales is to be developed on a 230-hectare
(570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall estate at Llandeilo in Dyfed. It will be dedicated to the
protection of threatened plant species and will be a centre of international significance. The
project is backed by a consortium of public and private organisations and individuals.
The Odyssey Project, Belfast
Total cost £90 million; Millennium Commission grant £45 million
This project will provide a mixture of education, entertainment and sporting facilities, including
the Science Centre, the IMAX (a two- and three-dimensional film theatre), an indoor arena,
pavilion and public open space. It will be the first major development on the east side of the ri\ er
Lagan in Belfast and is seen as a catalyst for future regeneration.

1 Introduction
Physical Features 1 Climate and Wildlife 3
Channel Islands and Isle of Man 1 Historical Outline 4
The establishment in 1999 of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly
for Wales and (subject to the outcome of a formal Implementation Review) the
Northern Ireland Assembly, is bringing about the most significant change in
the constitution in the United Kingdom since its formation in 1801.1 In
addition, eight new Regional Development Agencies have been set up in
England while a separate development agency for London will be formed under
the Greater London Authority in 2000.
Physical Features
The United Kingdom (UK) constitutes the
greater part of the British Isles. The largest of
the islands is Great Britain, which comprises
England, Scotland and Wales. The next
largest comprises Northern Ireland, which is
part of the UK, and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large island
chains known as the Inner and Outer
Hebrides, and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are the Orkney and Shetland
Islands. All these, along with the Isle of
Wight, Anglesey and the Isles of Scilly, have
administrative ties with the mainland, but the
Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel
Islands between Great Britain and France are
largely self-governing, and are not part of the
United Kingdom. The UK is one of the 15
member states of the European Union (EU).
1 When the UK was the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland. The Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic)
was created in 1922, leaving Northern Ireland in the Union.
The devolution of political power in 1999 is discussed in
greater detail in chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
With an area of about 243,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), excluding inland water, the
United Kingdom is just under 1,000 km
(about 600 miles) from the south coast to the
extreme north of Scotland and just under 500
km (around 300 miles) across at the widest
point.
The population of the UK increased from
38.2 million in 1901 to 59.2 million in 1998.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and
remained subject to the English Crown after
the loss of mainland Normandy to the French
in 1204. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct
administration of the British Crown in 1765,
when it was bought for £70,000. Its
parliament, ‘Tynwald’, was established more

apply to the Islands under the same conditions
as they apply to the UK. However, the free
movement of persons and services within the
EU as a whole only extends to the Islanders if
they have close ties with the UK, although
they do still enjoy their traditional rights in
the UK.
Climate and Wildlife
The climate in the United Kingdom is
generally mild and temperate. Prevailing
winds are south-westerly and the weather
from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions and their associated fronts moving
eastwards across the Atlantic, punctuated by
settled, fine, anticyclonic periods of a few days
to weeks. In general, there are few extremes of
temperature; it rarely rises above 32°C (90°F)
or falls below -10°C (14°F). However, as with
other countries, the UK has experienced
unusual weather in recent years—for example,
the period between summer 1995 and winter
1997 was the driest in England and Wales
since weather records began in the 18th
century, while April 1998 was the wettest
since 1818.
Average annual rainfall is more than 1,600
mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas
of the west and north but less than 800 mm
(30 inches) over central and eastern parts.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the
year but, on average, March to June are the
driest months and September to January the
wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest
daylight (November, December and January)
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of
an hour a day in northern Scotland and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
According to the Hadley Centre for
Climate Prediction and Research, global
warming may cause annual average UK
temperatures to be about 1.5°C warmer by the
Anecdotal evidence of climate change over
the past 100 years can be found in such
sources as the London County Council
Statistics for 1900-01. In the winter of
1899-1900, ‘permanent cleansing staff
and other regular employees together
spent 37,687 hours of work, and casual
labourers 17,792 hours, removing snow
from the streets of the London Borough of
Wandsworth alone. In recent years snow
has rarely settled for long enough in
central London to warrant removal.
Harder evidence of climate change in the
UK comes from the Central England
Temperature, an instrument record going
back to the mid-18th century, which has
shown an increase of about 0.6°C since the
last century.
3
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
2050s compared with the 1961-90 average
(three times the rise between 1881-1910 and
1968-1997). Such an increase could also result
in a rise in average sea levels of 25-35
centimetres. A recent report commissioned by
Scottish Natural Heritage, taking a 1.8°C rise
in average temperature in Scotland by 2100 as
one scenario, forecasts that Scottish pine
forests will be gradually replaced by oak trees.
It suggests that various mountain birds, plants
and insects will be threatened by higher
temperatures, but some species and habitats
will thrive or expand, including lowland
flowers, over-wintering birds, bats, butterflies
and peat bogs.
The UK is home to a great variety of
wildlife, with an estimated 30,000 animal
species, as well as marine and microscopic life;
about 2,800 species of ‘higher’ plants; and
many thousands of mosses, fungi and algae.
However, the unusual weather of recent
years—together with changes in farming
methods, urban development and other
factors—has put pressure on a number of
species, such as the song thrush, dormouse
and great crested newt, while over 50 different
mosses are already thought to be on the verge
of extinction. A new £100,000 project
launched in February 1999, and run by
English Nature and the Royal Botanic
Gardens, is aiming to find new ways to halt
the decline of these species, both in the wild
and through propagation, freezing and culture
(see also p. 325).
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a Celtic
original. Although in the prehistoric timescale
the Celts were relatively late arrivals in the
British Isles, only with them does Britain
emerge into recorded history. The term
‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in
55 and 54 BC, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland. The final Roman withdrawal in 409
followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. The raids turned into
settlement and a number of small English
kingdoms were established. The Britons
maintained an independent existence in the
areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms more
powerful ones emerged, claiming overlordship
of the whole of England, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
10th century the Wessex dynasty defeated the
invading Danes and established a wide-
ranging authority in England. In 1066
England was invaded by the Normans (see
p. 7), who then settled along with others from
France.
Dates of some of the main events in Britain’s
history are given below. The early histories of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland are included in chapters 2 to 5.

THE UNION FLAG
The flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is officially called the Union Flag,
because it embodies the emblems of three countries united under one Sovereign.
It is commonly known as the Union Jack. The term ‘jack’ was first used in the Royal Navy during the
17th century to describe the Union Flag, a little smaller than the other ensigns worn by ships at that time,
which was flown at the main masthead of a ship.
The Union Flag
The emblems that appear on the Union Flag
are the crosses of three patron saints:
the red cross of St George, for England,
on a white ground;
the white diagonal cross or saltire of St Andrew,
for Scotland, on a blue ground; and
the red diagonal cross attributed to St Patrick,
for Ireland, on a white ground.
Wales is not represented in the Union Flag
because when the first version of the flag appeared, Wales was already united with England.
The first Union Flag, in 1606, combined the national flag of England -
the cross of St George - and that of Scotland - the cross of St Andrew.
The cross of St George
The cross of St Patrick
The final version of the Union Flag appeared in 1801,
following the union of Great Britain with Ireland,
with the inclusion of the cross of St Patrick.
The cross remains in the flag although now only
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom;
southern Ireland is a separate republic.
The national flag of Wales, a red dragon on a field
of white and green, dates from the 15th century,
and is in widespread use throughout the Principality.
The Welsh flag
DEVOLUTION
Scottish Parliament
The new Scottish Parliament is initially meeting in the
General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh.
Holyrood, at the foot of Edinburgh’s Royal Mile, will be the
Parliament’s permanent site (see p. 22).

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the South West (in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset). The
greatest concentrations of population are in London and the South East, South
and West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the West Midlands
conurbation, and the north-east conurbations on the rivers Tyne and Tees.
England’s population is expected to rise from 49.9 million in 2001 to 52.5
million in 2021.
Early History
The name ‘England’ is derived from the
Angles, one of the Germanic tribes which
established monarchies in lowland Britain in
the 5th century, after the final withdrawal of
the Romans in 409. The Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms were initially fairly small and
numerous, but gradually larger entities
emerged. Eventually Wessex came to dominate,
following its leading role in resisting the Danish
invasions of the 9th century. Athelstan
(924-39) used the title of‘King of all Britain’,
and from 954 there was a single Kingdom of
England. The present Royal Family is
descended from the old royal house of Wessex.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings and became King William I. Many
Normans and others from France came to
settle; French became the language of the
nobility for the next three centuries; and the
legal and social structures were influenced by
those prevailing across the Channel.
When Henry II, originally from Anjou, was
king (1154-89), his ‘Angevin empire’
stretched from the river Tweed on the
Scottish border, down through much of
France to the Pyrenees. However, almost all
the English Crown’s possessions in France,
after alternating periods of expansion and
contraction, were finally lost during the late
Middle Ages.
England and Wales were integrated
administratively and legally in 1536-42 during
the reign of Henry VIII, and the union of
England and Scotland took place in 1707,
when Queen Anne was Sovereign.
Government
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, England has no separate elected
national body or a department exclusively

responsible for its central administration.
Instead, there are a number of government
departments, whose responsibilities in some
cases also cover aspects of affairs in Wales and
Scotland (see Appendix 1). A network of nine
Government Offices for the Regions (GOs—
see p. 10) is responsible for the
implementation of several government
programmes in the English regions.
There are 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the House of
Commons. After the General Election of May
1997, England had 328 Labour Members of
Parliament (MPs), 165 Conservative, 34
Liberal Democrat and one independent.1 By
August 1999 there had been six by-elections,
but in each case the political party that had
been representing the constituency retained
the seat. Conservative support tends to be
strongest in suburban and rural areas, and the
party has a large number of parliamentary
seats in the southern half of England. The
Labour Party has tended in the past to derive
its main support from the big cities and areas
associated with traditional industry, but it won
many seats in the last General Election that
had previously been considered safe
Conservative constituencies. The Liberal
Democrats, who are traditionally strong in the
South West, now have a third of their 34
English seats in Greater London and the
South East.
Local government is administered in many
areas through a two-tier system of county and
district councils. However, there are also a
number of single-tier, or unitary,
authorities—especially in the larger cities.
England elects 71 representatives (MEPs)
to the European Parliament (see p. 70). In the
June 1999 election, the Conservatives won 33
seats, Labour 24, the Liberal Democrats nine,
the UK Independence Party three and the
Green Party two.
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions known
1 The Speaker of the House of Commons, who presides
over the debates there (see p. 43), traditionally does not
vote along party lines and so is not counted towards the
strength of the party for which he or she was originally
elected. The independent MR is the former journalist Martin
Bell, who won what had been the safe Conservative seat of
Tatton in Cheshire.
as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on the other,
parliamentary and European Community
legislation (‘statute law’). In the formulation of
common law since the Norman Conquest, great
reliance has been placed on precedent. Equity
law—law outside the scope of the common law
or statute law—derives from the practice of
petitioning the Lord Chancellor in cases not
covered by common law.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation in the early 16th
century, is the Established Church (that is, the
official religion of England). The Sovereign
must always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops (see p. 240).
A London Mayor and Assembly
In a referendum in 1998, 72% of those who
voted said yes to having a directly elected
Mayor for the capital, and a separately elected
assembly of 25 members.2 The Mayor and
Assembly will form a new Greater London
Authority (GLA), the first elected London¬
wide body since the Greater London Council
was abolished in 1986.
The first elections for the Mayor and
Assembly will be on 4 May 2000, and the GLA
will assume its responsibilities on 3 July 2000,
subject to parliamentary approval. Thereafter,
elections will take place every four years. The
GLA will not duplicate the work of the
boroughs, but will have responsibility for
London-wide issues: transport, economic
development, strategic planning, culture,
health, the environment, the police, fire and
emergency planning. It will be housed in a new
building to be constructed on a ‘brownfield’
(that is, previously developed) site between
London Bridge and Tower Bridge, on the
south bank of the river Thames.
2 Of the 25 members, 14 will represent constituencies
covering two or more London boroughs; the rest will be
‘London-wide Members’ divided among the political parties
according to their share of the vote for these 11 seats. The
new arrangements will not affect the continuance of the
separate post of Lord Mayor of London (first established in
1191), whose role is restricted to the City of London, the
financial ‘Square Mile’ at the heart of the capital.
9
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Four other administrative bodies will come
into being at the same time as the GLA, and
will be accountable to it: a new Metropolitan
Police Authority; the London Fire and
Emergency Planning Authority; Transport for
London; and the London Development
Agency, one of nine regional agencies covering
the whole of England.
Work is starting during 1999 on
construction of the First footbridge (for
pedestrians only) across the river Thames
probably since Roman times. The
‘Millennium Bridge’ will span the river
from St Paul’s steps on the north bank to
the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art at
Bankside on the south bank. It is expected
to open in April 2000.
The Regions of England
The Government wishes to see a more
accountable system of regional government in
England where there is demand for this. Eight
of the nine Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) in England have now been created
under the Regional Development Agencies
Act 1998 (see p. 11) and the London
Development Agency will be established as
part of the arrangements for the Greater
London Authority. Regional chambers—
working within the present democratic
structure—will provide a measure of regional
responsiveness in what RDAs do and will help
build up the voice of the regions and enhance
regional identities. The first eight chambers
were designated between May and July 1999.
The economic performance of the nine
English regions (see map), and subregions
within them, varies quite considerably. For
example, Inner London had the highest average
gross domestic product (GDP) per head in
1994-96 in the European Union (EU), even
though it also contains some of the worst
pockets of deprivation in the UK. On the other
hand, in March 1999 South Yorkshire and
Cornwall and the Scilly Isles qualified for the
highest level of European funding (‘Objective
F—see p. 395)3 because their GDP per head
3 Merseyside was already an Objective 1 area and remains
so.
Regions of England Covered by the Regional
Development Agencies and Government
Offices for the Regions (GOs)
was less than 75% of the EU average.
According to the latest figures, total household
disposable income per head in 1996 was above
the England average in London, the South East
and East; and the same three regions had the
highest gross hourly earnings for full-time
employees in 1998. The North East had the
lowest disposable income and hourly earnings,
as well as the lowest GDP per head, in 1997,
for a whole region (as opposed to a subregion).
Some of the consequences of economic
success in the wealthier English regions are
higher residential and industrial property
prices, and higher rental costs for offices.
Average journey times to work are far longer
in London than elsewhere, ranging from 30
minutes in Outer London to 55 minutes into
Central London, compared with an average in
Great Britain of just 24 minutes. In autumn
1997 the number of people entering Central
London between 7.00 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. on
each working day was nearly 1.1 million, a 5%
increase on the previous year. Of those
working in Central London, 76% used public
transport, compared with the average of 13%
for Great Britain as a whole.
10
ENGLAND
Regional Development Agencies
The RDAs aim to improve the economic
t performance and competitiveness of the
English regions and tailor national policies to
regional needs. Among other things, they are
bringing together the regional regeneration
work previously carried out by English
Partnerships and the Rural Development
Commission (see pp. 356-7), and by the GOs,
and are responsible for co-ordinating inward
investment in their own regions.
RDAs are accountable through ministers to
Parliament. Their boards of around 12
members, plus chairman, are business-led, but
also reflect the broad range of groups that have
an interest in the regional economy. Four
positions on each board are filled by local
councillors and one by a leading trade unionist.
In addition, RDAs are required to take account
of the views of new voluntary regional
chambers in preparing their strategies and
corporate plans, and to give them an account of
their activities. The combined budget for the
eight RDAs operating in 1999-2000 is £967
million, although their initiatives are also
expected to attract private finance.
The Agencies are required to prepare their
first strategies by October 1999. These should
show how they are going to develop an
integrated and sustainable approach to
increasing business competitiveness and
productivity, and to addressing the underlying
problems in their regions of unemployment,
skills shortages, inequalities, social exclusion
and environmental decay.
Rural Areas
There are over 16,700 rural towns, villages
and hamlets in England with populations of
10,000 or fewer.4 According to this definition,
one in five people live in a rural area. Over
three-quarters of rural settlements have
populations of under 500. In many respects,
the rural economy is vibrant and healthy.
Although small firms dominate the rural
economy, where larger firms do exist, local
employment is particularly vulnerable to any

Agency (see p. 319).
downturn in their performance: larger
companies comprise just 1.4% of rural firms,
but account for 31% of employment. Earnings
are generally low. National policies such as the
New Deals for the unemployed and the
national minimum wage are intended to help
tackle these problems. As elsewhere in the
country, the advances in telecommunications
are allowing more people in isolated areas to
work from home.
Car ownership is greater in rural
households (84%) than nationally (69%), but
it needs to be, since the countryside often
lacks services that urban dwellers take for
granted.
The comparative lack of public transport,
of such importance for access to other
services, is one of the issues which the
Government is particularly keen to address. In
1998 it allocated an extra £150 million over
three years to improve rural transport in the
UK as a whole. A further £10 million a year
for the next two years was announced in the
1999 Budget. By April 1999 the first £50
million of funding had already led to the
creation of over 550 new, and 700 enhanced,
rural bus services in England. The provision
of some other services, such as childcare
facilities, has also improved, and the
Government is increasingly ensuring that the
rural dimension is fully reflected in its wider
policy-making—in its preparation, for
example, of a White Paper on the future of
rural England.
The Environment
Despite its high population density and degree
of urbanisation, England has many unspoilt
rural and coastal areas. There are eight
National Parks (including the Norfolk
Broads), nine forest parks, 37 designated
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 22
Environmentally Sensitive Areas, over 200
country parks recognised by the Countryside
Agency, and more than 1,043 km (648 miles)
of designated heritage coastline. At the end of
March 1999, there were 197 National Nature
Reserves, 612 Local Nature Reserves and
4,045 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. (See
also chapter 20.)

Since 1996 the Countryside Character
initiative has been mapping the landscape
character of the whole English
countryside, not just those parts of it that
have special protection. The countryside
has been divided into 159 separate,
distinctive character areas, and these are
described in detail in eight regional
volumes that are being published by the
Countryside Agency. The purpose of this
work is to enable proper account of the
widely varying character of England’s
countryside to be taken in all decisions,
national and local, which should lead to far
more sustainable management of the
English landscape.
Culture
London and the other large cities have a wealth
of cultural centres, including major art galleries,
renowned museums, theatres, ballet and opera
houses, and concert halls. Many theatres outside
London are used for touring by the national
theatre, dance and opera companies. Popular
culture also thrives in England, as elsewhere in
Britain: there are numerous kinds of pop music,
theatre styles such as pantomime and musicals,
jazz festivals and performances by comedians.
Safari, wildlife and theme parks all offer family
activities and entertainment. A proportion of
the proceeds from the National Lottery (see p.
122) is allocated to arts projects, which are also
featuring strongly in the millennial celebrations
(see pp. ix-xii).
Many regions and towns have associations
with great English writers, artists and
musicians: such as Stratford-upon-Avon
(William Shakespeare), the Lake District
(William Wordsworth), Stoke-on-Trent
(Arnold Bennett), Haworth (the Bronte
sisters) and Dorset (Thomas Hardy); Essex
and Suffolk (John Constable) and Salford
(L.S. Lowry); and Worcestershire (Edward
Elgar), Aldeburgh (Benjamin Britten) and
Liverpool (The Beatles).

About half of the 1.7 million people in Northern Ireland live in the eastern
coastal region, the centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Northern Ireland is, at
its nearest point, only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a 488-km (303-
mile) border with the Irish Republic. A comprehensive agreement on a political
settlement for Northern Ireland—the Good Friday Agreement—was reached in
April 1998 and a referendum held the following month which endorsed its
proposals. Elections to a new Northern Ireland Assembly took place in June and
it met for the first time in July 1998. Efforts to achieve the full implementation
of the agreement are continuing.
The Northern Ireland Continuous Household
Survey (CHS)1 reported that 54% of the
population regarded themselves as Protestants
and 42% as Roman Catholics. Most of the
Protestants are descendants of Scots or
English settlers who crossed to north-eastern
Ireland; they are British by culture and have
traditionally been committed to remaining
part of the UK. The Roman Catholic
population is mainly Irish by culture and
history, and many are nationalist in political
aspiration, favouring union with the Irish
Republic. Northern Ireland has a younger
population with proportionately more children
and fewer pensioners than any other region in
the UK.

History
During the 10th century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II of
England invaded Ireland, having been granted
its overlordship by the English Pope Adrian
IV, who was anxious to bring the Irish Church
into full obedience to Rome. Although a large
part of the country came under the control of
Anglo-Norman nobles, little direct authority
was exercised from England during the
Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents.
The main area of resistance was the northern
province of Ulster. After the collapse of this
resistance in 1607 and the flight of its leaders,
Protestant immigrants from Scotland and
England settled in Ulster.
13
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Northern Ireland Districts
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further uprisings in Ireland, which were
crushed by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting
took place after the overthrow of the Roman
Catholic James II in 1688. During the Battle
of the Boyne in 1690 the forces of James II,
who was trying to regain the throne, starting
in Ireland, were defeated by those of the
Protestant William of Orange (William III).
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
Crown. The Parliament, however, represented
only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and
the Roman Catholic majority was excluded
from it. Following the abortive rebellion led
by Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen movement
in 1798, Ireland was unified with Great
Britain under the 1800 Act of Union. The
Irish Parliament was abolished in 1801 and
Irish members sat in both Houses of the
Westminster Parliament.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill designed to give
a new Irish Parliament devolved authority
over most internal matters while Britain
maintained control over foreign and defence
policy. This failed as did a second Bill
introduced in 1893.
The issue returned to the political agenda
in 1910 because the Liberal Government was
dependent for its political survival on support
from the pro-Home Rule Irish Parliamentary
Party. The controversy intensified as unionists
and nationalists in Ireland formed private
armies. In 1914 Home Rule was approved in
the Government of Ireland Act.
Implementation, however, was suspended by
the outbreak of the First World War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in the general
election to the Westminster Parliament. Its
members refused to attend the House of
Commons and, instead, formed the Dail
Eireann in Dublin. A nationalist guerrilla
force called the Irish Republican Army began
14
NORTHERN IRELAND
operations against the British administration
in 1919.
In 1920 the Government of Ireland Act
provided for separate Parliaments in Northern
and Southern Ireland, subordinate to
Westminster. The Act was implemented in
Northern Ireland in 1921, giving six of the
nine counties of the province of Ulster their
own Parliament with powers to deal with
internal affairs. However, the Act proved
unacceptable in the South, and in 1922,
following negotiations between the British
Government and Sinn Fein, which led to the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the 26 counties of
Southern Ireland left the UK to become the
Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic).
Recent History
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland had
its own Parliament in which the Unionists,
primarily representing the Protestant
community, held a permanent majority and
formed the regional government. The
nationalist minority resented this persistent
domination and their effective exclusion from
political office and influence.
Between the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
civil rights movement and responses to it led
to serious inter-communal rioting. This led to
the introduction in 1969 of British Army
support for the police. These sectarian
divisions were subsequently exploited by
militant nationalists (principally the
Provisional Irish Republican Army—IRA)
and ‘Loyalist’ paramilitary groups.
Because of increased terrorism and inter-
communal violence, the British Government
took over direct responsibility for law and
order in 1972. The Northern Ireland Unionist
Government resigned in protest at this
decision, the regional government was
abolished, and direct rule from Westminster
began. A Secretary of State was appointed
with a seat in the UK Cabinet and with overall
responsibility for the government of the
Province.
Government
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
currently has overall responsibility, through
the Northern Ireland Office, for political and
constitutional matters, law and order, policing
and criminal justice policy and community
relations. The Secretary of State and a
ministerial team also control the work of the
Northern Ireland government departments
(see p. 537). All laws are approved by the UK
Parliament. When devolution takes place,
different arrangements will apply (see p. 18),
but the Secretary of State will remain
responsible for Northern Ireland Office
matters not devolved to the Assembly, and the
Westminster Parliament (whose power to
make legislation for Northern Ireland would
remain unaffected) will legislate for non-
devolved issues.
Northern Ireland elects 18 Members of
Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons
and, by proportional representation, three of
the 87 UK representatives to the European
Parliament.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Political Change
The system of direct rule was never intended
to be permanent. Over the years, successive
British and Irish Governments have worked
closely together to bring peace to Northern
Ireland, recognising the need for new political
arrangements acceptable to both communities
in the Province.
Recent Developments
• 1985. The Anglo-Irish Agreement
provided a new basis for relations
between the UK and the Irish Republic,
creating an Intergovernmental
Conference in which to discuss issues
such as improved cross-border co¬
operation and security.
• 1991-92. The British and Irish
Governments held a series of talks with
the four main constitutional parties
(Ulster Unionists, Democratic Unionists,
Alliance Party, and Social Democratic &
Labour Party) to try to find a settlement,
but no agreement was reached. The
British Government continued bilateral
talks with the Northern Ireland parties
and separately with the Irish
Government on matters of mutual
interest under the auspices of the Anglo-
Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
• 1993. The Downing Street Declaration,
signed by the British and Irish
Governments, set out their views on how
a future settlement might be achieved.
The declaration restated the fundamental
principle that any constitutional change
would require the consent of a majority
of people in Northern Ireland.
• 1995—96. The two Governments set up
an independent International Body to
examine the decommissioning of illegally
held arms by paramilitary groups.
Chaired by former US Senator George
Mitchell, the International Body set out
six principles of democracy and non¬
violence (the Mitchell Principles) to
which it said all parties should adhere.
• 1997. Following the British General
Election in May, the new Government
confirmed its intention of making the
talks process as inclusive as possible. It
maintained that any agreement reached
would have to have the broad support of
the parties representing each of the main
communities. In September the British
and Irish Governments set up the
Independent International Commission
on Decommissioning to make proposals
for taking terrorist arms out of action and
to monitor implementation. This body
comprises Commissioners and staff from
the United States, Canada and Finland.
• 1998. Multi-party talks in Belfast
concluded in April with what became
known as the ‘Good Friday Agreement’.
Legislation was passed at Westminster
authorising a referendum on the
settlement in Northern Ireland and
permitting elections to a new Northern
Ireland Assembly. The Irish Parliament
also considered the Agreement and
passed legislation authorising a
concurrent referendum in the Irish
Republic. In May referendums were held
in both parts of Ireland, and the
Agreement received a clear endorsement.
Northern Ireland voted 71.1% in favour
and 28.8% against, while in the Irish
Republic the result was 94.3% and 5.6%
respectively. A new Northern Ireland
Assembly of 108 members was elected in
June and met for the first time the
following month (see p. 18). Legislation
to implement the whole settlement, and
formally institute devolved
administrative powers, was introduced in
the Westminster Parliament in July 1998
and received Royal Assent the following
November (see p. 17).
• 1999. Almost all aspects of the
Agreement have been implemented. An
independent Policing Commission
started a year-long review of the future
policing needs in Northern Ireland; a
scheme for the early release of prisoners
was established and measures to
normalise the security situation have
been introduced (see below). Steps
towards the establishment of new
Equality and Human Rights
Commissions—as provided for in the
16
NORTHERN IRELAND
Good Friday Agreement—have also been
taken.
The one remaining area awaiting
implementation is the linked issues of the
decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons
(see below) and the formation of a cross¬
community Executive to which power can be
devolved. Despite attempts by both the
British and Irish Governments and the
political parties in Northern Ireland, the latest
attempt occurring in July 1999, it has so far
not proved possible to secure consensus on
how the difficulties surrounding these issues
can be practically resolved to enable the full
implementation of the Agreement to occur.
On 20 July, both Governments initiated a
formal Implementation Review, provided for
in the Agreement, and asked the former
chairman of the multi-party talks, Senator
George Mitchell, to act as facilitator. The
review, which is limited to the resolution of
the decommissioning/formation of an
Executive question, aims to reach a speedy
conclusion.
The Northern Ireland Act 1998
The Act, which received Royal Assent in
November 1998, is intended to give legal
effect to the Good Friday Agreement. It sets
out the principle of consent to change in
constitutional status and makes the detailed
provision necessary for the future
administration of Northern Ireland, new
Intergovernmental bodies, and new
arrangements on human rights and equality.
Intergovernmental Dialogue
A North/South Ministerial Council has been
set up to bring together those with executive
responsibilities in Northern Ireland and the
Irish Government, to work on matters of
mutual interest. All decisions will be by
agreement between the two sides. Those
participating in the Council will be mandated
by, and remain accountable to, the Northern
Ireland Assembly and to the Irish Parliament.
Six ‘implementation bodies’ have been
identified to put decisions taken by the
Council into effect. Their specific areas are:
inland waterways; food safety; trade and
business development; special European
Union (EU) programmes; language; and
marine matters.
A British-Irish Council will be set up to
bring together the two Governments,
representatives of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and the
Scottish Parliament, and delegates from the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, to
address issues of mutual interest.
A new British-Irish Agreement to replace
the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, outlining the
shared understanding on constitutional
matters, and a new British-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference, to promote
co-operation between the two Governments,
are also due to be established.
Decommissioning
The Good Friday Agreement committed all
participants to the total disarmament of all
paramilitary organisations. The participants
also confirmed their intention to continue to
work constructively and in good faith with the
Independent International Commission and to
use any influence they may have to achieve the
decommissioning of all paramilitary arms, in
the context of the implementation of the
whole settlement, within two years of the May
1998 referendum.
The Independent International
Commission will monitor, review and verify
progress on decommissioning and will report
regularly to both Governments. Both
Governments have agreed to take all necessary
steps to facilitate the decommissioning process
and to ensure that decommissioning occurs by
May 2000. To this end it is expected that the
Implementation Review under Senator
Mitchell will seek to address how best this
objective can be achieved in a manner
determined by the Independent International
Commission, alongside that of establishing an
inclusive Executive.
Po licing and Justice
An Independent Commission on Policing was
set up in June 1998 under the Chairmanship
of Chris Patten, former Governor of Hong
17
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Kong and former Northern Ireland Minister.
The Commission considered the appropriate
role the police service should play in a society
free from the threat of terrorist violence, while
fully commanding the support of both
communities. The UK Government is
considering the recommendations made in the
Commission’s report, which was published in
September 1999. There is a parallel review of
the criminal justice system, which will report
by autumn 1999 (see p. 232).
Release of Prisoners
The Agreement committed both
Governments to making arrangements for an
accelerated programme for the release of
paramilitary prisoners. Legislation was passed
in the Westminster Parliament in July 1998
establishing the independent Sentence Review
Commission, which looks at individual
prisoners’ cases to determine eligibility for
release on licence. The first prisoners to
qualify under these new arrangements were
released in September 1998.
The New Northern Ireland Assembly
Following the referendum held in May 1998
(see p. 16), which resulted in a majority voting
in favour of the Good Friday Agreement, the
new Northern Ireland Assembly was
constituted under the Northern Ireland
(Elections) Act 1998.

In June 1998, 108 members were elected to
the Assembly by proportional representation
(single transferable vote) from the existing 18
Westminster constituencies.
The Assembly met for the first time in July
1998 and elected the First Minister
(Designate) and Deputy First Minister
(Designate) on a cross-community basis. It has
since established several committees, including
one to advise on Standing Orders for the
future operation of the body and another to
advise the initial Presiding Officer of the new'
Assembly. Other cross-party committees have
advised on the procedural consequences of
devolution and the future of Belfast Port.
Human Rights
Economic and social deprivation persists on
both sides of the Northern Ireland community.
However, on all major social and economic
indicators, Roman Catholics generally
experience higher levels of disadvantage than
Protestants, leading to feelings of
discrimination and alienation which in turn
influence attitudes to political and security
issues. Government guidelines aim to promote
fair treatment by ensuring that policies and
programmes do not discriminate unjustifiably
against, for example, people of different
religious beliefs or political opinion, women,
disabled people, ethnic minorities and people of
different sexual orientation. The Government
provides funding for local government
programmes designed to encourage mutual
understanding and appreciation of cultural
diversity; support is also given to the Cultural
Traditions Programme, which attempts to
show that different cultures do not have to lead
to division. The aim of these initiatives is to
encourage a more pluralistic and tolerant
society with equal esteem for unionist and
nationalist traditions.
Equality Commission
Under the Fair Employment and Treatment
(Northern Ireland) Order 1998, which came
into operation in March 1999, a new Equality
Commission has been set up, taking over the
functions of the Fair Employment
Commission, the Equal Opportunities
18
NORTHERN IRELAND
Commission, the Commission for Racial
Equality and the Disability Council. It aims to
ensure that public authorities meet the new
statutory obligation to promote equality of
opportunity in all the services they provide to
the public. Direct or indirect discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful and there is
compulsory monitoring of the religious
composition of workforces, continual review
of recruitment, training and promotion
procedures, and affirmative action if fair
employment is not provided.
Human Rights Commission
The Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission, established under legislation in
1998, met for the first time in March 1999. The
- Commission’s role is to consult and advise on
the scope for defining rights supplementary to
those in the European Convention on Human
Rights, which the Government is incorporating
into UK law (see p. 212).
The Parades Commission
The Parades Commission was set up in 1997
and given full statutory powers in March 1998
to help implement new legislation over
contentious parades in Northern Ireland. In
the absence of local agreement on contentious
parades, the Commission may make legally
binding determinations, such as imposing
route conditions. The Commission imposed
conditions on 119 such parades in the year to
31 March 1999 out of a total of 3,211.
The vast majority of parades each year are
organised by the Protestant/Unionist
community, especially the ‘Loyal Orders’.
Most take place during the six months from
around Easter to the end of September.
Victims of Violence Commission
A Commission to look at possible ways of
providing greater recognition of the suffering
felt by victims of violence arising from the
events of the last 30 years was set up in 1997.
The Commission, chaired by Sir Kenneth
Bloomfield, reported in May 1998 and the
Government has since announced a number of
support measures for victims, including an
independent review of criminal injuries
compensation arrangements (also chaired by
Sir Kenneth Bloomfield).
Security Policy
The authorities have exceptional powers to
deal with and prevent terrorist activities,
including special powers of arrest for those
suspected of certain serious terrorist offences,
non-jury courts to try terrorist offences (see
p. 232) and the banning of terrorist
organisations. The relevant legislation is
subject to annual independent review and to
annual approval by Parliament (see p. 216).
An Independent Commissioner observes
and reports on the conditions under which
terrorist suspects are detained by the security
forces in police offices known as Holding
Centres. Statutory codes of practice apply to
the detention, treatment, questioning and
identification of suspects. A breach of any of
the codes’ provisions by a police officer is a
disciplinary offence.
At present an independent Commission
supervises police investigations into the more
serious complaints against police officers and,
at its discretion, the investigation of other
matters. Under legislation passed in July 1998,
the Commission is to be replaced with a new
office of Police Ombudsman.
The Economy
Throughout the 1990s the Northern Ireland
economy has performed well. Gross domestic
product (GDP) rose by 16.4% between 1990 and
1996, compared with 9.6% for the UK as a
whole. Manufacturing output rose by 28%
between 1991 and 1998, compared with the UK
rate of 9%. Employment has grown throughout
the decade and unemployment has declined since
1993. However, the Labour Force Survey for
March to May 1999 showed that 66.3% of those
people of working age in Northern Ireland were
in employment, compared to 73.9% in the rest of
the UK. Comparable rates for unemployment
were 7.2% and 6.2% respectively.
A substantial increase in new inward
investment in growth industries such as
19
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
computer software, telecommunications and
network services contributed to the 5,434 new
jobs generated by the Industrial Development
Board in 1998 in difficult world economic
conditions.
Northern Ireland’s economic strategy has
been reviewed to take account of changing
needs by a largely private sector-led steering
group which drew on the input of 18 working
groups. The steering group report—Strategy
2010—will be presented to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly for its consideration.
The public expenditure allocation within
the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland’s
responsibility for 1999-2000 is £8.4 billion.
Economic Assistance
In 1986 the British and Irish Governments
established the International Fund for Ireland.
Some three-quarters is spent in Northern
Ireland, the rest going to border areas in the
Irish Republic. Programmes cover business
enterprise, tourism, community relations,
urban development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United
States, Canada, New Zealand and the
European Union. The Berlin EU summit at
the end of March 1999 agreed a Special
Programme for Northern Ireland in support of
peace worth about £260 million between the
years 2000 and 2004. It also confirmed the
renewal for three years of EU support of
approximately £10 million a year for the
International Fund for Ireland.
Northern Ireland currently receives around
£1.3 billion under the EU Structural Funds
Programme (see p. 395). Over the period
1995_99 some £200 million of this has come
from the Special Support Programme for
Peace and Reconciliation. The five areas
eligible for funding are employment; urban
and rural regeneration; cross-border
development; social inclusion; and productive
investment and industrial development. Up to
80% of funds are allocated to Northern
Ireland, and the remainder must be spent on
cross-border activities.
The Irish Language
In June 1998, the Government announced its
intention to sign the Council of Europe
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,
and to specify Irish for the purposes of part III
of the charter at an early date. In July 1998, a
statutory duty was placed on the Department
of Education in Northern Ireland to encourage
and facilitate Irish-medium education.
A new branch within the Northern Ireland
civil service is being established to develop
policy on linguistic diversity, including the
Irish language. Estimates suggest that around
142,000 people in Northern Ireland have some
ability to use Irish as a means of
communication, either orally or in writing. A
cross-border implementation body is being set
up with responsibility for promoting the Irish
language and facilitating and encouraging its
use; £108,000 has also been spent on a study of
the Ulster-Scots language.

and Executive
Three-quarters of the population of Scotland live in the central lowlands. The
chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital), Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, and many of the
UK’s mountains, including its highest peak, Ben Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft).
Scotland’s first Parliament for almost 300 years was officially opened by the
Queen on 1 July 1999. It has taken over responsibility for many functions
formerly exercised by the Parliament at Westminster (London).
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited by
the Piets. Despite a long campaign, Roman
rule was never permanently extended to most
of Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots
from Ireland settled in what is now Argyll,
giving their name to the present-day Scotland.
War between the kingdoms of England and
Scotland was frequent in the Middle Ages.
Despite reverses such as the defeat of William
Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert the Bruce’s
victory over Edward II of England at
Bannockburn in 1314 ensured the survival of a
separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded in
1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century, apart
from an enforced period of unification under
Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s, until in 1707
the English and Scottish Parliaments agreed
on a single parliament for Great Britain.
Population
Scotland’s population has changed relatively
little in the last 50 years. In June 1998 the
population was 5.12 million (see Table 4.1),
compared with 5.24 million in 1971.
Population density averages 66 people per sq
km, the lowest density in the UK.
Scottish Parliament and Executive
The Scotland Act 1998 provided for the
establishment of the Scottish Parliament and
Executive, following endorsement of the UK
Government’s proposals on devolution in a
referendum in 1997 when the proposal to
establish a Scottish Parliament was supported
by 1,775,045 votes (74.3% ) to 614,400

Parliament’s tax-raising powers (see p. 24),
was also supported, by 1,512,889 votes
(63.5%) to 870,263 (36.5%).
In the first election to the Parliament, in
May 1999, 129 Members of the Scottish
Parliament (MSPs) were elected for a fixed
four-year term: 73 MSPs for single-member
constituencies and 56 MSPs representing
eight regions, based on the European
parliamentary constituencies, each with seven
members. The latter were allocated so that
each party’s overall share of seats in the
Parliament, including the constituency seats,
reflected its share of the regional vote. Under
the ‘additional member system’ of
proportional representation (PR), each elector
had two votes: one for a constituency MSP
and a ‘regional’ vote for a registered political
party or an individual independent candidate.
The Labour Party, which has traditionally
done well in elections in Scotland, became the
largest single party, with 56 MSPs (see Table
4.2), winning 53 of the 73 constituency seats,
including nearly all those in central Scotland.
The Scottish National Party is the second
largest party, with 35 MSPs. Most of its seats
came from the ‘top-up’ PR system, as did all
the 18 seats won by the Conservative Party,
the third largest party in the Parliament.
Responsibilities
The Scottish Parliament’s responsibilities
include health; education and training; local
government; housing; economic development;
home affairs and many aspects of civil and
criminal law; transport; the environment;
agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and sport
and the arts. In these areas, the Scottish
Parliament is able to amend or repeal existing
Acts of Parliament and to pass new legislation.
The Parliament is meeting initially at the
General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh’s Old
Town. A new permanent site for the
Parliament is planned at Holyrood, at the
other end of the Royal Mile. The area is in the
historic centre of Edinburgh, and the previous
Scottish Parliament met from 1640 to 1707 in
Parliament House on the Royal Mile. The new
building is expected to be completed by the
end of 2001.
The Scottish Executive is headed by a First
Minister, normally the leader of the party able
to command majority support in the

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Parliament. Following the 1999 election, the
Executive is being run by a coalition between
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with the
latter having two seats in the Cabinet,
including that of Deputy First Minister. The
Cabinet comprises 11 positions:
• First Minister;
• Deputy First Minister and Minister for
Justice;
• Minister for Social Inclusion, Local
Government and Housing;
• Minister for Transport and the
Environment;
• Minister for Health and Community Care;
• Minister for Rural Affairs;
• Minister for Children and Education;
• Lord Advocate;
• Business Manager;
• Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong
Learning; and
• Minister for Finance.
The Scottish Executive has responsibility
for all public bodies whose functions and
services have been devolved and is accountable
to the Parliament for them. It also has an input
into bodies such as the Forestry Commission
(see p. 464), which operate in Scotland and
elsewhere in the UK. The Commission on
Local Government and the Scottish
Parliament is considering how to build the most
effective relationship between the Parliament/
Executive and the 32 local authorities.
Responsibility for overseas affairs, defence
and national security, overall economic and
monetary policy, employment legislation and
social security remains with the UK
Government and Parliament. The position of
Secretary of State for Scotland continues, with
the responsibility of representing Scottish
interests within the UK Government.
Finance
The Scottish Parliament has a budget broadly
equivalent to that formerly controlled by the
Secretary of State—nearly £16 billion in
1999-2000. Once the amount of the budget
has been determined, the Parliament is free to
In June 1999 the First Minister announced
the first legislative programme for the
Parliament. Eight Bills are planned,
including Bills to:
• reform the system of land ownership,
giving local communities the right to
buy land when it becomes available,
and creating a right of access for
ramblers and climbers;
• abolish the system of feudal tenure;
• allow the creation of National Parks,
with the intention of establishing the
first in Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs (see p. 321);
• improve education by introducing a
requirement for local authorities to
raise standards and tackle the
problems of underperforming
schools; and
• tackle the problems of traffic
congestion by allowing local
authorities to introduce a levy on
workplace parking and bring in road
user charging, and to update the
regulatory framework for buses.
allocate resources across the expenditure
programmes.
The Parliament has the power to increase
or decrease the basic rate of income tax—23
pence in the pound—by a maximum of 3
pence. Liability to tax is based on residence,
with a person considered resident if he or she
is a UK resident for tax purposes and either
spends 50% or more of the tax year in
Scotland or has his or her only or principal
home in Scotland.
The Parliament is responsible for
determining the form of local taxation and, if
it wishes, is able to alter both the council tax
and business rates.
The Economy
In the last 50 years the economy has moved
away from the traditional industries of coal,
steel and shipbuilding, with the establishment
of the offshore oil and gas industry, growth in
24
SCOTLAND
services and, more recently, developments in
high-technology industries, such as chemicals,
electronic engineering and information
technology. Manufacturing remains
important, and Scotland’s manufacturing
exports were provisionally estimated at £19
billion in 1998, 6.7% higher than in 1997,
with above average increases in exports of
metals and metal products, transport
equipment, and paper, printing and
publishing.
Notable features of the Scottish economy
include:
• Electronics. Scotland has one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry
in Western Europe, with around 660 units
(some 420 companies) employing about
40,300 workers. Electrical and instrument
engineering exports were worth £10
billion in 1998, 54% of Scotland’s
manufacturing exports.
• Oil and gas. Offshore oil and gas
production has made a significant
contribution to the Scottish economy in
the last 30 years. Many of the UK’s 109
offshore oilfields are located to the east of
Shetland, Orkney or the east coast of
Scotland (see map, opposite p. 420).
• Whisky. Whisky continues to be one of
Scotland’s most important industries.
There are 92 whisky distilleries in
operation, mostly in the north east.
Whisky exports dominate exports by the
drinks industry, which were valued at
£1.8 billion in 1998.
• Tourism. Tourism is a major industry,
supporting about 177,000 jobs. In 1998
expenditure by tourists in Scotland was
valued at £2.47 billion; there were 11.8
million tourist trips, including those
originating in Scotland.
• Financial services. Funds managed by
financial institutions in Scotland were
some £224.9 billion in 1999, of which
£96.5 billion were in long-term life
insurance funds and £66.9 billion in
pension funds. Several financial
institutions are based in Scotland,
including insurance companies, fund
managers, unit trusts and investment
trusts. There are four Scottish-based
clearing banks, which have limited rights
to issue their own banknotes.
One of Scotland’s leading financial
concerns, the insurance company Scottish
Widows, is being acquired by Lloyds
TSB (one of the UK’s biggest banks).
However, as part of the takeover, Lloyds
TSB is to transfer its own savings
business into Scottish Widows, and this
combined operation will be based in
Edinburgh.
• Forestry. Scotland accounts for just under
half of the UK’s timber production. In
the last ten years there has been
significant international and local
investment in wood-based panel
production and in pulp and paper
processing.
• Fishing. Fishing remains significant,
particularly in the north east, and the
Highlands and Islands. In 1998,
Scotland accounted for 67% by weight
and 60% by value of the fish landed in
the UK by British vessels. Fish farming,
particularly of salmon, has become much
more important, and Scotland produces
the largest amount of farmed salmon in
the EU. However, some fish farms have
recently been affected by a viral disease,
Infectious Salmon Anaemia (see p. 462),
and measures are being taken to
eradicate it.
Support for industry and commerce is
managed by two bodies: Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see
p. 394). Inward investment is encouraged by
Locate in Scotland, a joint operation between
the Scottish Executive and Scottish
Enterprise. In 1998-99, 78 inward
investment projects were recorded, which are
expected to lead to investment of £760
million and the creation or safeguarding of
nearly 11,000 jobs.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system (see p. 228) differ in many
respects from those of England and Wales.
These differences stem, in part, from the
adoption of elements from medieval canon law
and selective borrowing from other European
legal systems, based on Roman law, during the
16th century. Preservation of Scots law and the
Scottish Courts was provided for in the 1707
Treaty of Union. In addition to separate courts
and a separate legal profession, Scotland has its
own prosecution, prison and police services.
Education and Culture
The Scottish education system has a number
of distinctive features (see chapter 10),
including a separate system of examinations
and differences in the curriculum. A new
system of courses and awards for education
after 16, ‘Higher Still’, is being phased in from
August 1999, and is expected to be fully
implemented in 2003. Record numbers of
students are entering post-compulsory
education—about 533,000 students were
enrolled in vocational, further or higher
education in 1997—98.
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin,
is spoken by some 70,000 people, many of
whom live in the Hebrides. The Scottish
Executive is providing £13 million to support
Gaelic in 1999-2000. Broadcasting is the
largest single area, accounting for £8.5
million. In 1998-99 there were 1,816 children
in Gaelic-medium education in 56 primary
schools and 235 pupils in 14 secondary
schools. Extra resources are being allocated to
supporting Gaelic education and cultural
organisations. Research carried out in
connection with the possible inclusion of a
question on the Scots language in the next
Census, in 2001, found that 30% of the
population claimed to be able to speak Scots
or a dialect of Scots.
The annual Edinburgh International
Festival is one of the world’s leading cultural
events. Held in August and September, it
brings about £70 million into the Scottish
economy each year, and is the largest arts
festival in the UK. Scotland possesses several
major collections of the fine and applied arts,
such as the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and
the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art,
in Edinburgh. A new Museum of Scotland has
been built in Edinburgh to house the National
Museums’ Scottish Collection.

The population of Wales is 2.9 million. About two-thirds live in the southern
valleys and the lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff
(with a population of 321,000), Swansea and Newport in the south and Wrexham
in the north. Much of Wales is hilly or mountainous. The highest peak is
Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
The National Assembly for Wales has been set up to give the people of Wales
greater control over their own affairs. It was officially opened by the Queen in
May 1999.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule (see p. 7),
Wales remained a Celtic stronghold, although
often during Norman times within the English
sphere of influence. In 1282 Edward I
completed a successful campaign to bring
Wales under English rule. The great castles
that he built in north Wales remain among the
UK’s finest historic monuments (see p. 329).
Edward Fs eldest son—later Edward II—was
born at Caernarfon in 1284 and was given the
title Prince of Wales, which continues to be
borne by the eldest son of the reigning
monarch.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the unsuccessful rising led by
Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542
united England and Wales administratively,
politically and legally.
National Assembly for Wales
Government proposals for devolution in
Wales were endorsed in a referendum in 1997
by 559,419 votes (50.3%) to 552,698 (49.7%).
The Government of Wales Act 1998 provided
for the establishment of the Assembly.
In the first election to the Assembly, held in
May 1999, electors had two votes: one for a
candidate in their local constituency and one
for a party list. The Assembly has 60 members:
40 from local constituencies (which are the
same as the House of Commons constituencies)
and 20 elected by the additional member
system of proportional representation from
electoral regions—four for each of the five
European parliamentary constituencies.
The Labour Party has traditionally been
strong in Wales, and won the largest number
of seats in the Assembly (see Table 5.2),
although it did not obtain an overall majority.
It is now running the Assembly as a minority
administration.

Responsibilities
On 1 July 1999 the Assembly took over
virtually all the functions formerly held by the
Secretary of State for Wales in the Parliament
in London. These include economic
development; agriculture, forestry, fisheries
and food; education and training; industry;
local government; health and personal social
services; housing; the environment; planning;
transport and roads; arts, culture and the
Welsh language; ancient monuments and
historic buildings; and sport and recreation. It
has acquired responsibility for most of the
annual billion budget formerly exercised
by the Welsh Office.
Foreign affairs, defence, taxation, overall
economic policy, social security and
broadcasting are the main functions for which
responsibility has remained with the
Government in London. The office of
Secretary of State for Wales is continuing,
with a seat in the Cabinet and responsibilities
for primary legislation, giving the Assembly
its budget and for matters in the Westminster
Parliament that relate to Wales. Wales retains
full representation in the Parliament in
London.
The Assembly has powers to make
secondary legislation (see p. 49) to meet
distinctive Welsh circumstances. It is based in
Cardiff Bay, initially meeting in a temporary
chamber until a new Chamber and associated
facilities are opened in 2001.
The First Secretary heads the Assembly
and in May 1999 he appointed a Cabinet of
eight secretaries. Their responsibilities are:
29
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
economic development;
education (up to 16);
health and social services;
post-16 education and training, Welsh
language and culture;
agriculture and rural economy;
environment (incorporating local
government and planning);
trefnydd (business secretary); and
finance.
The main priorities for the new
administration are education, economic
development and health. Additional
spending is planned in these areas, with
the intention of reducing class sizes,
raising education standards and improving
standards in the National Health Service.
An extra £87 million is being allocated to
regenerate the poorest communities in
Wales, and a new Social Inclusion Fund
has been established.
The Assembly controls 38 sponsored public
bodies. The organisations with the largest
expenditure are:
• the Higher Education Funding Council
for Wales (with planned gross
expenditure in 1999-2000 of £269
million);
• the Welsh Development Agency (WDA,
see p. 395) (£200 million), which was
enlarged in 1998 when it incorporated the
Development Board for Rural Wales and
the Land Authority for Wales; and
• the Further Education Funding Council
for Wales (£200 million).
Local Government
The 22 unitary local authorities (see map on
p. 29) spend nearly half of the total Welsh
budget. The Assembly is required to respect
the powers of local government, with the
emphasis on local decisions being taken at a
local level. A Partnership Council will be set
up, comprising members from the Assembly
and from the unitary authorities. Measures to
modernise local authority management
structures, strengthen local democracy and
improve local financial accountability were
contained in a White Paper issued in 1998.
Welsh Language
In 1997, 21% of the population said that they
spoke Welsh. In much of the rural north and
west, Welsh remains the first language of most
of the population.
Welsh is now more widely used for official
purposes, and is treated equally with English
in the work of the Assembly. It is also quite
extensively used in broadcasting, while most
road signs are bilingual. Welsh-medium
education in schools is encouraged. Welsh is
taught—as a first or second language—to
most pupils between the ages of 5 and 16, and
from September 2000 will be taught to all
pupils in this age group. In addition, other
subjects are taught in Welsh in about 500
schools, in both the primary and secondary
sectors.
The National Assembly has assumed the
main responsibility for enhancing Welsh
culture and developing greater use of the
Welsh language. The Welsh Language Act
1993 established the principle that, in public
business and the administration of justice in
Wales, Welsh and English should have equal
treatment. The Welsh Language Board aims
to promote and facilitate the use of the Welsh
language; in 1999-2000 its gross expenditure
will be £6 million.
Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the Welsh economy, which
traditionally used to be based on coal and
steel. Wales now has a more diverse range of
manufacturing industries, including many at
the forefront of technology, and a growing
number involved in electronic commerce.
However, the steel industry remains
important, and crude steel production in
Wales was around 7.7 million tonnes in 1997,
accounting for 42% of UK steel output.
Manufacturing accounts for 29% of gross
domestic product (GDP) in Wales, well above
30
WALES
the UK average. Wales is an important centre
for consumer and office electronics,
information technology, automotive
components, chemicals and materials,
aerospace, and food and drink. Around 39,200
people are employed in the optical and
electrical industries, and 13,800 in the
automotive components sector. In the service
sector, tourism and leisure services are
significant, with Wales accounting for 8% of
UK visitor expenditure, while call centre
activity is becoming more important and
prevalent.
A key feature of the economy has been the
success in attracting investment from overseas
companies and from elsewhere in the UK.
Since 1983, 1,932 inward investment projects
have been recorded in Wales, bringing in total
investment of £12.6 billion and promising the
creation and safeguarding of over 188,000 jobs.
Overseas-owned manufacturing companies in
Wales employ over 75,000 people.
In July 1998 the Government set out its
views on the economic future for Wales in
Pathway to Prosperity: A New Economic
Agenda for Wales. It envisages spreading
prosperity throughout Wales, through a more
coherent approach to indigenous and inward
investment, to be undertaken by the expanded
WDA. The Agency now has broader functions
and powers, so that it is better placed to
contribute to economic regeneration across the
whole of Wales. Increased resources are being
provided to support business development,
and a new Entrepreneurship Action Plan for
Wales is being co-ordinated by the WDA, to
develop a stronger business culture. A new
The area of West Wales and the Valleys,
which has been affected by the decline in
traditional industry (especially
coalmining), qualified in 1999 for the first
time for ‘Objective T status from the
European Union (EU) as its GDP was
below 75% of the EU average. The area
covers large parts of south, west, mid and
north Wales. It is eligible for the highest
levels of aid from the EU’s structural
funds (see p. 395) and will qualify for up
to £1.3 billion of aid between 2000 and
2006.
Rural Partnership for Wales, which brings
together a range of public and private sector
organisations, has prepared a statement on
rural issues for consideration by the National
Assembly for Wales.
Environment
Wales has a rich and diverse natural heritage.
About one-quarter is designated as a National
Park or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
(see p. 320). As well as three National Parks—
Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the
Pembrokeshire Coast—and five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are two
national trails, 36 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are also 62
National Nature Reserves, over 900 Sites of
Special Scientific Interest and a number of
internationally important nature conservation
sites in Wales. For example, 44 sites are
proposed for designation as Special Areas of
Conservation under the European Community
(EC) Habitat Directive, 13 Special Protection
Areas are classified under the EC Wild Birds
Directive, and ten wetlands of international
importance are designated under the Ramsar
Convention (see p. 326). There are six
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p. 455),
representing about 25% of the land in Wales,
while a new scheme, Tir Gofal, is being
introduced in 1999-2000 to replace most of the
current agri-environment schemes. Tir Gofal
aims to encourage agricultural practices that
will help to protect and enhance the landscape
and wildlife of the Welsh countryside.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature has a long tradition and can
claim to be one of the oldest in Europe. The
Welsh people have strong musical traditions
and Wales is well known for its choral singing,
while both the Welsh National Opera and the
BBC National Orchestra of Wales have
international reputations. Special festivals,
known as eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh
literature and music. The largest is the annual
Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
the world come to Llangollen for the annual
31
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
International Musical Eisteddfod. The
biennial ‘Cardiff Singer of the World’
competition has established itself as one of the
world’s leading singing competitions.
The National Museums and Galleries of
Wales include the Museum of Welsh Life at
St Fagans, near Cardiff; and the recently
rebuilt Welsh Slate Museum at Llanberis.
The main building in Cardiff contains many
paintings by Welsh artists, including Augustus
John, Gwen John and Kyffyu Williams as well
as a representative collection of other
important artistic works. A new Industrial and
Maritime Museum is to be built in Swansea.
The National Library of Wales at
Aberystwyth contains over 4 million books.
An active local press includes several Welsh
and English language publications. The fourth
television broadcaster, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), has recently been broadcasting in Welsh
for 12 hours a day on its new digital channel.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. Wales will stage the final of the
Rugby World Cup in November 1999 at the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff—Cardiff
Arms Park Stadium, which has been rebuilt,
at a cost of some £114 million. The Sports
Council for Wales is preparing a new strategy
for sport in Wales.

A major programme of constitutional reform is under way. Its aim is to
decentralise power, open up government, reform Parliament and increase
individual rights. In July 1999 the Scottish Parliament and the National
Assembly for Wales came into being, with powers to govern affairs in those
parts of the United Kingdom. A new Northern Ireland Assembly will begin to
function fully when the final elements of a cross-community agreement are in
place. Other plans include: setting up a city-wide authority and directly elected
mayor for London; increasing the openness of government through a Freedom
of Information Act; holding a referendum on the voting system for the House of
Commons; and reforming the House of Lords.
The Constitution
The system of parliamentary government in
the United Kingdom is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual
evolution over many centuries. The
constitution, unlike that of most other
countries, is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute law,
common law and conventions.1
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, and is
thus adaptable to changing political
conditions.
The component parts of UK government
overlap but can be clearly distinguished:
Parliament is the legislature and the
supreme authority. The executive consists of:
the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for national policies;
government departments and agencies,
responsible for national administration; local
authorities, responsible for many local
services; public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised industries;
independent bodies responsible for regulating
the privatised industries; and other bodies
subject to ministerial control.
The judiciary (see chapter 14) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
1 Conventions are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as indispensable to
the working of government.
33
Origins of Government
The origins of government in the UK are to
be found in each of the four geographical areas
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
it comprises: England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. England was united as a
kingdom over a thousand years ago, and Wales
became part of the kingdom during the Middle
Ages (see p. 27). The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and
in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries
provided for the establishment of a single
Parliament of Great Britain with supreme
authority both in England and Wales, and in
Scotland (see p. 21). Ireland had had links with
the kingdom of England since the 13 th
century, and in 1801 the creation of the United
Kingdom was completed by a union joining
the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain
(see p. 14). In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the
Irish Republic) became an entirely separate
and self-governing country. The six counties
of Northern Ireland had been given their own
subordinate Parliament in 1920, and voted to
remain within the United Kingdom. The UK
Parliament at Westminster in London, with an
elected chamber comprising members from
English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
constituencies, thus represents people sharing
very varied backgrounds and traditions. It has
had ultimate authority for government and
law-making, but takes account of the particular
needs of different areas.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Affairs
England and Wales on the one hand and
Scotland on the other have different systems
of law, a different judiciary, different
education systems and different systems of
local government. In Scotland, prior to
devolution, departments dealing with most
domestic issues were grouped under a
Secretary of State with a seat in the Cabinet
who had policy responsibility for these
matters in Scotland. The administration of
Welsh affairs was also formerly the
responsibility of a Secretary of State and a
ministerial team working through the Welsh
Office. The powers of the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and for Wales have been
reduced since the Scottish Parliament and
Executive and the Welsh Assembly began to
exercise their devolved authority in July
1999.
The UK Government assumed direct
responsibility for Northern Ireland in 1972
(see p. 15), and a Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland has been in charge of the
Northern Ireland Office since then. As with
Scotland and Wales, the powers of the
Northern Ireland Secretary will be reduced
when the new Northern Ireland Assembly
begins to exercise its full authority for
domestic affairs in the Province.
Background to Devolution
Referendums held in Scotland and Wales in
1997 endorsed proposals to devolve power from
Parliament at Westminster to a Scottish
Parliament (see p. 21) and a National Assembly
for Wales (see p. 27). Legislation was passed in
1998 to establish these bodies, and elections to
the Scottish Parliament and the National
Assembly for Wales were held in May 1999.
The Scottish Parliament has law-making
powers, including defined and limited
financial powers to vary revenue. It has taken
democratic control over many of the
responsibilities formerly exercised by The
Scottish Office. The National Assembly for
Wales provides democratic control over the
former Welsh Office functions. It has
secondary legislative powers and can reform
and control the non-departmental public
bodies (NDPBs—see p. 56) in Wales. The
Scottish and Welsh bodies are each elected by
a combination of a simple majority system and
proportional representation.
A comprehensive agreement on a political
settlement for Northern Ireland—the Good
Friday Agreement—was reached in 1998.
Following a referendum endorsing the
Agreement, elections to a new Northern
Ireland Assembly were held in June that year.
The Assembly has been operating in shadow
forrri since then. Negotiations between the
political parties on all sides of the community
have been taking place to finalise
arrangements which will allow the new
Northern Ireland Assembly to exercise its
devolved powers to the full (see pp. 17-18).
The responsibilities of the UK Parliament
remain unchanged over economic and
monetary policy, overseas affairs, defence and
national security.
34
GOVERNMENT
Human Rights Act 1998
The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the
European Convention on Human Rights into
domestic law. This enables people in the UK to
secure decisions on their human rights from
British courts and not just from the European
Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
The legislation makes it unlawful for public
authorities to act in a way that is incompatible
with the Convention rights, and enables the
courts to award whatever remedy within their
jurisdiction they see fit in the event of a breach
(see chapter 14).
At the turn of the century, the present
Queen’s great-great-grandmother, Queen
Victoria, was still on the throne. When she
died in 1901, aged 81, she had reigned for
63 years, having served as Monarch longer
than any other member of the Royal
Family before or since. The political stage
looked very different then. In the 1906
General Election, the Liberals won a
landslide victory over the Conservatives,
reversing the two parties’ fortunes from
the election held six years earlier.
However, the Liberal Party’s political
strength was subsequently to decline, a
process that was accelerated by the rise of
the Labour Party (founded in 1900) on the
strength of universal adult suffrage and its
trade union base.

The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is herself
directly descended from King Egbert, who
united England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the Monarchy was
the republic, which lasted from 1649 to 1660.
Today the Queen is not only Head of State,
but also a symbol of national unity. The
Queen’s title in the UK is: ‘Elizabeth the
Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the
Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the Monarchy is in the
UK, the Queen is also Head of State of a
number of Commonwealth states.2 In each of
these states the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government.
In UK Overseas Territories (see p. 77) the
Queen is usually represented by governors,
who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries concerned.
Succession, Accession and Coronation
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. Sons of the Sovereign still have
precedence over daughters in succeeding to
the throne. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen Regnant, and has the same
powers as a king. The consort of a king takes
her husband’s rank and style, becoming

Head of State are: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; the
Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica;
New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; St Kitts and Nevis;
St Lucia; St Vincent and the Grenadines; Solomon Islands;
and Tuvalu.

GOVERNMENT
Queen. The constitution does not give any
special rank or privileges to the husband of a
Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700, only
Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of
James I of England and VI of Scotland) are
eligible to succeed. The order of succession
can be altered only by common consent of the
countries of the Commonwealth of which the
Monarch is Sovereign.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as
soon as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all members
of the Privy Council (see p. 38) are
summoned. Members of the House of Lords
(see p. 41), the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
and other leading citizens of the City of
London are also invited.
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London, in the presence of representatives of
the Houses of Parliament and of all the major
public organisations in the UK. The Prime
Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations and representatives of
other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she
is head of the executive, an integral part of
the legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces
of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of
the established Church of England. As a
result of a long process of evolution, during
which the Monarchy’s absolute power has
been progressively reduced, the Queen acts
on the advice of her government ministers.
The UK is governed by Her Majesty’s
Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the Queen
still takes part in some important acts of
government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen formally
appoints important office holders, including
the Prime Minister and other government
ministers (see pp. 53-4), judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats, bishops
and some other senior clergy of the Church of
England. She is also involved in pardoning
people wrongly convicted of crimes; and in
conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
honours.3 In international affairs the Queen, as
Head of State, has the power to declare war
and make peace, to recognise foreign states
and governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are
responsible to Parliament and can be
questioned about particular policies. It is not
necessary to have Parliament’s authority to
exercise these prerogative powers, although
Parliament may restrict or abolish such
rights.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings
(see p. 38), gives audiences to her ministers
and officials in the UK and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must be
consulted on every aspect of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
The law provides for a regent to be
appointed to perform the royal functions if the
monarch is totally incapacitated. The regent
would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those, in order of succession to
the throne, aged 18 or over. In the event of her
partial incapacity or absence abroad, the
Queen may delegate certain royal functions to
the Counsellors of State (her husband the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not
dissolve Parliament (except on the Queen’s
instructions) or create peers.
3 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on
the advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the
Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremony has always been associated with the
British monarchy, and many traditional
ceremonies continue to take place. Royal
marriages and funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of state visits the UK and investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace
of Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours.
Each year the Queen and other members of
the Royal Family visit many parts of the UK.
They are also closely involved in the work of
many charities. For example, the Prince of
Wales is actively involved in The Prince’s
Trust, set up to encourage small firms and
self-employment in inner cities, while the
Princess Royal is President of the Save the
Children Fund. The Queen pays state visits to
foreign governments, accompanied by the
Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the other
countries of the Commonwealth.
On 19 June 1999, Prince Edward, the
Queen’s youngest son and seventh in line
of succession to the throne, married Miss
Sophie Rhys-Jones in St George’s Chapel,
Windsor Castle. Before the wedding the
Queen created Prince Edward the Earl of
Wessex, reviving a title which died out
when the last holder, King Harold II, was
killed in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. His
wife therefore became the Countess of
Wessex.
Royal Income and Expenditure
The expenditure arising from the Queen’s
official duties is met by the Civil List and by
government departments, which meet the cost
of, for example, royal travel (£9.3 million in
1999-2000) and the upkeep of the royal
palaces and media and information services
(£15 million in 1999-2000). The Civil List is a
payment from public funds approved by
Parliament to meet the costs of running the
Royal Household.
In 1991 Civil List payments were fixed at
£7.9 million a year for ten years. In July 2000
a Royal Trustee’s Report will make
recommendations on the Civil List for the
period 2001-2010. About three-quarters of the
Queen’s Civil List provision is required to
meet the cost of staff. Under the Civil List,
the Queen Mother and the Duke of
Edinburgh receive annual parliamentary
allowances (together amounting to £1 million)
to enable them to carry out their public duties.
Each year the Queen refunds the Government
for all parliamentary allowances received by
other members of the royal family. The Prince
of Wales does not receive a parliamentary
annuity, since as Duke of Cornwall he is
entitled to the annual net revenues of the
estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.
The Queen’s private expenditure as
Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which
is financed mainly from the revenues of the
Duchy of Lancaster;4 her expenditure as a
private individual is met from her own
personal resources.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. In line with these
changes, the Prince of Wales pays income tax
on the income from the Duchy of Cornwall so
far as it is used for private purposes.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s Court,
which assisted the Norman monarchs in
running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, however, much of the role of the
Privy Council was assumed by the Cabinet,
4 The Duchy of Lancaster is a landed estate which has
been held in trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is
separately administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster.
38
GOVERNMENT
although the Council retained certain
executive functions. Some government
departments originated as committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the approval
of Orders in Council (which are made under
prerogative powers, such as Orders approving
the grant of Royal Charters of incorporation,
and under statutory powers, which enact
subordinate legislation). Responsibility for
each Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she is present at
the meeting where approval is given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
There are about 500 Privy Counsellors at
any one time, consisting of all members of the
Cabinet, other senior politicians, senior judges
and some appointments from the
Commonwealth. Membership of the Council,
with the style of‘Right Honourable’, is
retained for life, except for very occasional
removals. It is accorded by the Sovereign on
the recommendation of the Prime Minister. A
full Council is summoned only on the
accession of a new Sovereign or when the
Sovereign announces his or her intention to
marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for charters
of incorporation. Committees may also be
provided for by statute, such as those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities. Except for the Judicial
Committee, membership is confined to
members of the current administration.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is primarily the final court of appeal
from courts in UK Overseas Territories and
those Commonwealth countries which
retained this avenue of appeal after
independence. The Committee also hears
appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, and from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and allied
professions. It has a limited jurisdiction to
hear certain ecclesiastical appeals.
The members of the Judicial Committee
include the Lord Chancellor, the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, other Privy Counsellors
who hold or have held high judicial office and
certain judges from the Commonwealth.
Administrative work is carried out in the Privy
Council Office under the President of the
Council, a Cabinet minister.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
own revenue. If extra resources were needed
for an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons in the Great
Council—a gathering of leading men which
met several times a year—to grant aid. During
the 13 th century several English kings found
the private revenues and baronial aids
insufficient to meet the expenses of
government. They therefore summoned not
only the great feudal magnates but also
representatives of counties, cities and towns,
primarily to get their assent to extraordinary
taxation. In this way the Great Council came
to include those who were summoned by
name (those who, broadly speaking, were to
form the House of Lords) and those who were
representatives of communities—the
Commons. The two parts, together with the
Sovereign, became known as ‘Parliament’ (the
term originally meant a meeting for parley or
discussion).
Over the course of time the Commons began
to realise the strength of their position. By the
middle of the 14th century the formula had
appeared which in substance was the same as
that used nowadays in voting supplies to the
Crown—that is, money to the government—
namely, ‘by the Commons with the advice of the
39
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Lords Spiritual and Temporal’. In 1407 Henry
IV pledged that henceforth all money grants
should be approved by the House of Commons
before being considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions, the
Commons gained the right to submit
collective petitions. During the 15th century
they gained the right to participate in giving
their requests—their ‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century led to
Parliament securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Sovereign, the House of
Lords and the elected House of Commons—
are constituted on different principles. They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the State Opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Sovereign to the House of
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for the UK as a
whole, or for any parts of it separately. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
and not part of the UK. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island affairs
(see p. 2).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to the UK’s
obligations as a member of the European
Union (see p. 69). It can make or change any
law, and overturn established conventions or
turn them into law. It can even prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in the 20th century the House
of Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide (by voting for taxation) the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is
also informed before important international
treaties and agreements are ratified. The
making of treaties is, however, a royal
prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice General Elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Dissolution of Parliament and
writs for a General Election are ordered by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime
Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at night,
at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and the late
Spring Bank Holiday, and during a long
summer break usually starting in late July.
The average number of‘sitting’ days in a
session is about 168 in the House of Commons
40
GOVERNMENT
and about 146 in the House of Lords. At the
start of each session the Sovereign’s speech to
Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each
session is ended by prorogation. Parliament
then ‘stands prorogued’ for about a week until
the new session opens. Prorogation brings to
an end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The Lords
Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the Bishops of London, Durham
and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior
diocesan bishops of the Church of England.
Pending new legislation before Parliament (see
below), the Lords Temporal consist of:
• all hereditary peers of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(but not peers of Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in its
judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or ‘law
lords);5 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House provided holders establish their
claim and are aged 21 years or over. However,
anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12
months of succession, disclaim that peerage
for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their
right to sit in the House but gain the right to
vote and stand as candidates at parliamentary
elections. When a disclaimant dies, the
peerage passes on down the family in the usual
way.
Both hereditary and life peerages are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other walks
of public life or because one of the political
parties wishes to have the recipient in the
House of Lords. The House also provides a

cases in the UK and for criminal cases in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
place in Parliament for people, including
cross-benchers, who offer useful advice but do
not wish to be involved in party politics.
Reforming the House of Lords
The Government is committed to a step-
by-step reform of the House of Lords. It
proposes to make the second chamber
more democratic and representative by:
• removing the right of hereditary peers
to sit and vote in the second chamber;
• establishing a transitional House with
reformed arrangements for the
nomination of life peers; and
• initiating wide-ranging longer-term
reform.
In January 1999, following a White
Paper detailing its proposed changes, the
Government introduced the House of
Lords Bill. When enacted, the legislation
would remove the right of some 750
people to sit and vote in Parliament solely
on the basis that they inherited their seats.
Ninety-two existing hereditary peers
would be allowed to sit temporarily in the
transitional chamber until a full reform
programme is in place. During that time
non-political appointments would be made
on the recommendation of an independent
Appointments Commission.
A Royal Commission was set up in
February 1999 to make recommendations
on the role, functions and composition of a
reformed second chamber and to report by
the end of 1999. It is intended that a joint
committee of the House of Commons and
the House of Lords would then be
established to consider those
recommendations. The Government has
said that it will make every effort to ensure
that the second stage of reform has been
approved by Parliament by the next
General Election.
Three main political parties are represented
in the Lords; the number of peers eligible to
sit and declaring party allegiance is shown in
Table 6.1.

Note: Excludes peers without writ of summons or on leave of absence (130).
Members of the House of Lords (the
average daily attendance is about 386) receive
no salary for their parliamentary work, but can
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House (for which there are maximum daily
rates) and certain travelling expenses.
In January 1999 there were 1,165 members
of the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 627 hereditary peers who
had succeeded to their titles, nine hereditary
peers who had had their titles conferred on
them (including the Prince of Wales), and 503
life peers, of whom 28 were ‘law lords’, created
under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.
There were 103 women peers.
The total potential membership of the
House is reduced by about 60 by a scheme
which allows peers who do not wish to attend
to apply for leave of absence for the duration of
a Parliament. In addition, some hereditary
peers do not receive a writ of summons
entitling them to sit in the House, for example,
because they have not established their claim to
succeed or because they are minors.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack6 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In the Lord Chancellor’s absence, his place is
taken by a deputy.
6 The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion
stuffed with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it
is a tradition dating from the medieval period, when wool
was the chief source of the country’s wealth.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk
of the Parliaments is responsible for the
records of proceedings of the House of Lords
and for the text of Acts of Parliament. He is
the accounting officer for the House, and is in
charge of its administrative staff, known as the
Parliament Office. The Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, usually known as ‘Black Rod’,
is responsible for security, accommodation
and services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see p. 43) and
consists of 659 Members of Parliament (MPs).
In May 1999 there were 121 women MPs and
nine MPs from ethnic minorities. Of the 659
seats, 529 are for England, 40 for Wales, 72 for
Scotland, and 18 for Northern Ireland. The
number of Scottish seats is to be reviewed now
that the Scottish Parliament has been set up
(see chapter 4).
General Elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign. When an MP
dies or resigns,7 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £47,008 (from 1 April 1999 to
31 March 2000) and an office costs allowance
(from April 1999) of up to £50,264. Other
allowances include travel allowances, a

supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p. 54.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who act as Deputy Speakers. They
are elected by the House on the nomination of
the Government but are drawn from the
Opposition as well as the government party.
They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity (when
deputising for the Speaker). Responsibility for
the administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker on
the House’s privileges and procedures. The
Clerk’s other responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part of
the building, and is responsible for security.
Other officers serve the House in the Library,
the Department of the Official Report
(Hansard), the Finance and Administration
Department, and the Refreshment
Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes the UK is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To ensure
that constituency electorates are kept roughly
equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
They recommend any adjustment of seats that
may seem necessary in the light of population
movements or other changes. Reviews are
conducted every eight to 12 years. The
recommendations in the Commissions’ last
general reviews were approved by Parliament
in 1995.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the
Irish Republic resident in the UK, may vote
provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote.
People not entitled to vote include people
under 18, members of the House of Lords,
foreign nationals (other than Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic),
some patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff
of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered for an
address in the constituency where they would
live but for their service. British citizens living
abroad may apply to register as electors for a
period of up to 20 years after they have left the
UK.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors who
cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station on polling
day—for example, electors away on holiday—
may apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or because
they have moved to a new area may apply for
an absent vote. People entitled to an absent
vote may vote by post or by proxy, although
postal ballot papers cannot be sent to
addresses outside the UK.
43
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Voting is not compulsory; 71.5% of a total
electorate of 44.2 million people voted in the
General Election in May 1997. The simple
majority system of voting is used. Candidates
are elected if they have more votes than any of
the other candidates (although not necessarily
an absolute majority over all other candidates).
The Government proposes to hold a
referendum on the voting system for the
House of Commons. The Independent
Commission on the Voting System was set up
in 1997 to identify an alternative to the present
‘first-past-the-post’ system for Westminster
and it produced a report in 1998. A
Ministerial Working Group has been set up to
examine a number of aspects of electoral law
and practice, with the aim of modernising
electoral procedures. The Working Group
issued a summary of recommendations in July
1999 and the final report is expected to follow
shortly.
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people who have been sentenced to more than
one year’s imprisonment; clergy of the Church
of England, Church of Scotland, Church of

A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party. A
candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5% or more of
the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,965 plus
4.2 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 5.6 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. Higher limits have been
set for by-elections in order to reflect the fact
that they are often regarded as tests of national
opinion in the period between General
Elections. The maximum sum is £19,863 plus
16.9 pence for each elector in borough seats,
and 22.2 pence for each elector in county
seats. A candidate may post an election
communication to each elector in the
constituency free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory
maximum.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval; in practice most
candidates in elections, and almost all winning
candidates, belong to one of the main parties.
A system of voluntary registration for political
parties in the UK was introduced in 1998.
However, registration is necessary for the
proportional representation electoral systems
which involve ‘lists’ of candidates, used in
elections to the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales and, for the first
time nationally in June 1999, for electing UK
members to the European Parliament.
Registration helps prevent the use of
misleading candidates’ descriptions on ballot
papers at election, since only candidates
representing a registered or political party are
permitted to have the name and emblem of the
party printed on the ballot paper.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-
party system has existed in Britain. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, whose origins
go back to the 18th century, or the Labour
Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
19th century, has held power. A new party—
the Liberal Democrats—was formed in 1988
when the Liberal Party, which traced its
origins to the 18th century, merged with the
Social Democratic Party, formed in 1981.
Other parties include two nationalist parties,
Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and
the Scottish National Party (founded in 1934).
Northern Ireland has a number of parties.
They include the Ulster Unionist Party,
44
GOVERNMENT
formed in the early part of the 20th century;
the Democratic Unionist Party, founded in
1971 by a group which broke away from the
Ulster Unionists; the Social Democratic and
Labour Party, founded in 1970; and Sinn
Fein.8
Since 1945 eight General Elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and seven
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties.

The General Election, May 1997
The May 1997 general election was notable in
a number of ways:
• The Labour Party’s 13.5 million votes
were exceeded only in 1951, and the
party’s share of 43.2% of the vote was its
highest since 1966. The 418 seats won
were the party’s largest number ever.
• The Conservative Party’s 9.6 million
votes were its fewest since 1929, and its
share of 30.7% of the vote was the lowest
since 1832. The 165 seats won were its
smallest number since 1906. The
Conservatives won no seats in Scotland,
Wales or Northern Ireland.
• The Liberal Democrats’ 5.2 million votes
were fewer than in 1992, as was the
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA.
party’s share of the total vote, but the 46
seats won represented the party’s highest
number since 1929, when it won 59 as the
Liberal Party.
• Turnout at the election was relatively
low, at 71.5%—the lowest national level
of turnout since 1935.
• A record number of women were elected
in 1997. In all 120 women MPs were
returned, double the number in 1992. Of
the women MPs, 101 were Labour, 13
Conservative, three Liberal Democrat,
two SNP and one was the Speaker.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a General
Election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is
asked by the Sovereign to form a government.
About 100 of its members in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p. 55) on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The largest
minority party becomes the official
Opposition, with its own leader and ‘shadow
cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons with
their supporters (the ‘backbenchers’) sitting
behind them. Similar arrangements for the
parties apply to the House of Lords; however,
a significant number of Lords do not wish to
be associated with any political party, and sit
on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths of
the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of
policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
45
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
to Government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances of
winning the next General Election.
The detailed arrangements of government
business are settled, under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two
Houses, by the Government Chief W'hips of
each House in consultation with the
Opposition Chief Whips. The Chief W hips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to when the question of finding time
for a particular item of business is discussed.
The Leaders of the two Houses are
responsible for enabling the Houses to debate
matters about which they are concerned.
Parliamentary party control is exercised by
the Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party (usually by the
Leader). Their duties include keeping
members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of backbench
members. Party discipline tends to be less
strong in the Lords than in the Commons,
since peers have less hope of high office and
no need of party support in elections.
Financial Assistance to Parties
The Government plans to make party funding
more transparent, control spending on
elections and ensure the fair conduct of
referendums. In July 1999 it published a White
Paper—The Funding of Political Parties in the
United Kingdom—setting out its response to
the 1998 report by the Committee on
Standards in Public Life (see p. 59). The
White Paper includes a draft Bill—the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill—
which contains provisions for:
• a registration scheme to bring parties
under specified funding controls;
• a requirement on parties to disclose the
source and amount of donations above
£5,000;
• a ban on the acceptance of donations
made from outside the UK;
• national spending limits on parties
determined by the number of
constituencies and/or regions contested
in an election—in a General Election, a
party with candidates in all 659 seats
could spend up to £19.77 million;
• a framework for the fair conduct of
referendums; and
• a new Electoral Commission to supervise
the financial restrictions on parties and
oversee referendums—it would take over
the functions of the Boundary
Commissions and the Local Government
Commission for England, and have broad
responsibility for electoral law, provide
guidance on party political broadcasts
and promote understanding of electoral
and political matters.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and
precedent, partly codified by each House in its
Standing Orders. The system of debate is similar
in both Houses. Every subject starts off as a
proposal or ‘motion’ by a member. After debate,
in which each member (except the mover of the
motion) may speak only once, the motion may
be withdrawn: if it is not, the Speaker or
Chairman ‘puts the question’ whether to agree
with the motion or not. The question may be
decided without voting, or by a simple majority
vote. The main difference in procedure between
the two Houses is that the Speaker or Chairman
in the Lords has no powers of order; instead
such matters are decided by the general feeling
of the House, which is sometimes interpreted by
the Leader of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must guard against the abuse of procedure and
protect minority rights. The Speaker has
discretion on whether to allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the
vote, and has powers to put a stop to irrelevance
and repetition in debate. In cases of grave
disorder the Speaker can adjourn or suspend the
sitting. The Speaker may order members who
have broken the rules of behaviour of the House
to leave the Chamber or can initiate their
suspension for a number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In a
tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
46
GOVERNMENT
without expressing an opinion on the merits of
the question. Voting procedure in the House
of Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor may vote but does not have a
casting vote.
Modernisation of the House of Commons
A Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons was set up in 1997 to
consider how its practices and procedures
should be modernised. Its first report, on the
legislative process, called for greater flexibility
in the way legislation is handled and suggested
that it should be possible in defined
circumstances to carry forward Bills from one
session to the next. The Committee is now
looking at other issues, including the structure
of the parliamentary year, the process for
scrutinising European legislative proposals,
and the ability of MPs to make the
Government accountable for its actions.
Measures to modernise debating
procedures were approved in the Commons in
1998. These include abolishing the preference
given to Privy Counsellors’ speeches in
debates and the rule preventing MPs from
quoting from speeches made in the Lords.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-financial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must
declare it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. MPs cannot advocate matters in the
House which are related to the source of any
personal financial interest.
The House of Lords also has a Register of
Interests, on lines similar to that for MPs. It,
too, is open to public inspection.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards was created in 1995, following
recommendations of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life (see p. 59). The
Commissioner, who is independent of
government, can advise MPs on matters of
standards, and conduct a preliminary
investigation into complaints about alleged
breaches of the rules by Members. The
Commissioner reports to the House of
Commons Select Committee on Standards
and Privileges.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
in Hansard, the Official Report) are published
daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of
the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a number
of former members of both Houses, are
available to the public through the House of
Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable and satellite television.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by ministers under
powers given to them by Act (see p. 49).
While the interpretation of the law undergoes
constant refinement in the courts (see p. 211),
changes to statute law are made by Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as individual
local authorities) or the rights of individuals
(such as certain proposals relating to railways,
roads and harbours) are known as Private
Bills, and are subject to a special form of
parliamentary procedure. Bills which change
the general law and which constitute the more
significant part of the parliamentary legislative
process are Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by an
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member (or
peer). Most Public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
47
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other MPs or Lords are
known as ‘Private Members’ Bills’.
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
Opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the Houses
over the succeeding weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and with interest and
pressure groups seeking to promote specific
causes. ‘White Papers’, which are government
statements of policy, often contain proposals
for legislative changes; these may be debated
in Parliament before a Bill is introduced.
From time to time consultation papers,
sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out
government proposals which are still taking
shape and seek comments from the public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost invariably introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. The Parliament Acts also provide
for a Bill to be passed by the Commons
without consent of the Lords in certain (very
rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the Bill
is considered, without debate, to have been
read for a first time and is printed. After an
interval, which may be between one day and
several weeks, a Government Bill will receive
its second reading debate, during which the
general principles of the Bill are discussed.
If it obtains a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill will normally be committed
to a standing committee (see p. 50) for detailed
examination and amendment. In the Lords,
the committee stage usually takes place on the
floor of the House, and this procedure may
also be followed in the Commons if that
House so decides (usually in cases where there
is a need to pass the Bill quickly or where it
raises matters of constitutional importance).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of the
House, during which further amendments may
be made. In the Commons, the report stage is
usually followed immediately by the third
reading debate, when the Bill is reviewed in its
final form. In the Lords, the third reading
debate usually takes place on a different day; a
Bill may be further amended at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one House,
a Bill is sent to the other House, where it passes
through all its stages once more and where it is,
more often than not, further amended.
Amendments made by the second House must
be agreed by the first, or a compromise
reached, before a Bill can go for Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. There
are special procedures for Public Bills which
consolidate existing legislation or which enact
private legislation relating to Scotland.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and becomes an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707. In the 1997—98 session 62
Public Bills were enacted.
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords go through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand, do
not generally prevent Bills insisted upon by
the Commons from becoming law, though
they will often amend them and return them
to the Commons for further consideration.
By convention, the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. A Bill that deals only with
taxation or expenditure must become law within
48
GOVERNMENT
one month of being sent to the Lords, whether
or not the Lords agree to it, unless the
Commons directs otherwise. If no agreement is
reached between the two Houses on a non-
financial Commons Bill, the Lords can delay the
Bill for a period which, in practice, amounts to
at least 13 months. Following this the Bill may
be submitted to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed a second time by the
Commons. There is one important exception:
any Bill to lengthen the life of a Parliament
requires the full assent of both Houses.
The limits to the power of the Lords are
based on the belief that nowadays the main
legislative function of the non-elected House is
to act as a chamber of revision, complementing
but not rivalling the elected House.
Private Members ’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of
the Commons ballot (draw lots) for the
opportunity to introduce a Bill on one of the
Fridays during the session when such Bills
have precedence over government business.
The first 20 members whose names are drawn
win this privilege, but it does not guarantee that
their Bills will pass into law. Members may also
present a Bill on any day without debate, while
on most Tuesdays and Wednesdays on which
the Commons is sitting there is also an
opportunity to seek leave to present a Bill
under the ‘ten minute rule’. This provides an
opportunity for a brief speech by the member
proposing the Bill (and by one who opposes it).
Few of these Bills make further progress or
receive any debate, but in most sessions some
do become law (ten in the 1997-98 session).
Private Members’ Bills do not often call for
the expenditure of public money; but if they
do they cannot proceed to committee stage
unless the Government decides to provide the
necessary money. Peers may introduce Private
Members’ Bills in the House of Lords at any
time. A Private Member’s Bill passed by one
House will not proceed in the other unless
taken up by a member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public Bills
which may affect private rights, for example,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill, which was
passed in 1996. As with Private Bills, the
passage of Hybrid Bills through Parliament is
governed by special procedures which allow
those affected to put their case.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (usually in
the form of‘statutory instruments’). To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament, such powers are normally
delegated only to authorities directly
accountable to Parliament. Moreover, Acts of
Parliament which delegate such powers
usually provide for some measure of direct
parliamentary control over proposed delegated
legislation, by giving Parliament the
opportunity to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also require that organisations affected must
be consulted before rules and orders can be
made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House as a whole. In the Lords, debates on
statutory instruments take place on the floor
of the House. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a Committee of the Whole House
49
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or peer may speak
only once on each motion does not apply in
committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are referred to simply as Standing Committee
A, B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole. The
standing committees currently still include
two Scottish standing committees, and the
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Grand
Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish MPs (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principle of
any Scottish Bill at the second and third reading
stages, where such a Bill has been referred to the
Committee by the House for that purpose. It
also debates other matters concerning Scotland.
In addition, its business includes questions
tabled for oral answer, ministerial statements
and other debates, including those on statutory
instruments referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, consisting
of all 40 Welsh MPs and up to five others who
may be added from time to time, considers
Bills referred to it at second reading stage,
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other matters relating
exclusively to Wales.
The Northern Ireland Grand Committee
considers Bills at the second and third stages,
takes oral questions and ministerial
statements, and debates matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland. It includes all
18 Northern Ireland MPs and up to 25 others
who may be added from time to time.
The House of Commons is considering
whether the Grand Committees, and the
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Select
Committees (see below) should have a
continuing role at Westminster following the
establishment of the Scottish Parliament and
the Welsh and Northern Ireland National
Assemblies.
There is a Standing Committee on
Regional Affairs, consisting of all Members
sitting for constituencies in England, plus up
to five others. It has not met since 1977, but
its revival is being considered.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments and draft
statutory instruments brought forward by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Grand
Committees, Select Committees and Scottish
Select Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as
long as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration, 16
committees, established by the House of
Commons, examine the work of the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
Environmental Audit Committee was set up
in 1997 (see p. 313). The committees are
constituted on a basis which is in
approximate proportion to party strength in
the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
50
GOVERNMENT
and Privileges, and European Legislation.
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
Each House has a select committee to keep
it informed of European Union (EU)
developments, and to enable it to scrutinise
and debate EU policies and proposals, while
two Commons standing committees debate
specific European legislative proposals.
Ministers also make regular statements about
EU business.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question ministers, civil
servants, and interested bodies and
individuals. Through hearings and published
reports, they bring before Parliament and the
public an extensive body of fact and informed
opinion on many issues, and build up
considerable expertise in their subjects of
inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees: on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues (or,
sometimes, a particular Bill), and ‘domestic’
committees—as in the Commons—cover the
internal workings of the House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills9 and
statutory instruments (see p. 49). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When
the Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are elected
and half of whom are government
9 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts
into one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
representatives, acts as a channel of
communication between the Government and
its backbenchers in both Houses. When the
party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the Conservative
Party is in office, ministers attend its meetings
by invitation and not by right. When the party
is in opposition, the whole membership of the
party may attend meetings. The leader
appoints a consultative committee, which acts
as the party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the system of scrutiny by select
committees, both Houses offer a number of
opportunities for the examination of
government policy by both the Opposition
and the Government’s own backbenchers. In
the House of Commons, the opportunities
include:
1. Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s
Question Time takes place for half an
hour every Wednesday when the House
is sitting. Parliamentary questions are one
means of seeking information about the
Government’s intentions. They are also a
way of raising grievances brought to
MPs’ notice by constituents. MPs may
also put questions to ministers for written
answer; the questions and answers are
published in Hansard. There are about
60,000 questions every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the
House to raise constituency cases or
matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end
of the business of the day, and
opportunities for several adjournment
debates on Wednesday mornings. In
51
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
addition, an MP wishing to discuss a
‘specific and important matter that
should have urgent consideration’ may,
at the end of Question Time, seek leave
to move the adjournment of the House.
On the very few occasions when leave is
obtained, the matter is debated for three
hours in what is known as an emergency
debate, usually on the following day.
3. Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs
to express their views on particular
issues. A number of EDMs are tabled
each sitting day; they are very rarely
debated but can be useful in gauging the
degree of support for the topic by the
number of signatures of other MPs which
the motion attracts.
4. Opposition days (20 each session) when
the Opposition can choose subjects for
debate. Of these days, 17 are at the
disposal of the Leader of the Opposition
and three at the disposal of the second
largest opposition party.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee (a select committee largely
made up of select committee chairmen,
which considers general matters relating
to the work of select committees).
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the
debate on the Queen’s Speech at the
beginning of each session; during debates
on motions of censure for which the
Government provides time; and during
debates on the Government’s legislative
and other proposals.
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
Question Time, during debates and by means
of questions for written answer.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the raising
of taxes and duties, and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on each.
Parliament also has to satisfy itself that the
sums granted are spent only for the purposes
which it intended. No payment out of the
central government’s public funds can be
made, and no taxation or loans authorised,
except by Act of Parliament. However, limited
interim payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement (see p. 389). Scrutiny of public
expenditure is carried out by House of
Commons select committees (see p. 50).
Forcing the Government to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of‘no confidence’. The
Government must also resign if the House
rejects a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has
declared it a ‘matter of confidence’ or if the
House refuses to vote the money required for
the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred through MPs)
alleging that they have suffered injustice
arising from maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons. The Ombudsman’s
jurisdiction covers central government
departments and agencies and a large number
of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
He cannot investigate complaints about
government policy, the content of legislation
or relations with other countries.
In making investigations, the Commissioner
has access to all departmental papers, and has
powers to summon those from whom he
52
GOVERNMENT
wishes to take evidence. When an
investigation is completed, he sends a report
with his findings to the MP who referred the
complaint (with a copy for the complainant).
When a complaint is justified, the
Ombudsman normally recommends that the
department or other body provides redress
(which can include a financial remedy for the
complainant in appropriate cases). There is no
appeal against the Ombudsman’s decision. He
submits an annual report to Parliament, and
publishes selected cases three times a year.
The Ombudsman received 1,506 new
complaints in 1998-99 (an increase of 3% over
the previous year), and completed 372
investigations. Complaints against the
Department of Social Security accounted for
647 of the total received.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
monitors the Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information (see p. 58).
Separate arrangements for a Scottish
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration have been set up to deal with
complaints about the Scottish Executive and
devolved public bodies. Complaints to the
Scottish Commissioner are referred through
Members of the Scottish Parliament.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member. They include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance
of its members, who are therefore free from
arrest in civil actions and exempt from serving
on juries, or being compelled to attend court
as witnesses; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the rights of
the House to control its own proceedings (so
that it is able, for instance, to exclude
‘strangers’10 if it wishes); to decide upon legal
disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to
10 All those who are not members or officials of either
House.
punish for breach of its privileges and for
contempt. Parliament has the right to punish
anybody, inside or outside the House, who
commits a breach of privilege—that is, offends
against the rights of the House.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the Commons. The
law of privilege has been examined by a Joint
Committee of both Houses of Parliament,
which published its report in March 1999.
The committee’s main recommendation was
to call for a Parliamentary Privileges Act
codifying parliamentary privilege as a whole
and explaining its relevance, both to MPs and
to the electorate as a whole.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the conduct of
national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister. Most
ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
position of authority derives from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 55), is responsible for
allocating functions among ministers and
informs the Queen at regular meetings of the
general business of the Government.
53
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
Church of England archbishops, bishops and
deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown
‘livings’; senior judges, such as the Lord
Chief Justice; Privy Counsellors; and
Lord-Lieutenants. He or she also
recommends certain civil appointments, such
as Lord High Commissioner to the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland (after
consultation with the First Minister), Poet
Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some
university posts; and appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the
BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), as
well as various royal and statutory
commissions. Recommendations are likewise
made for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions (to
people who have achieved eminence in science
or the arts and are in financial need). The
Prime Minister also chooses the trustees of
certain national museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
London) is staffed by civil servants. The
Prime Minister may also appoint special
advisers to the Office to assist in the formation
of policies (see p. 60).
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’,
or may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the President of the Council, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform any
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give
them. In the present administration, for
example, the President of the Council is
Leader of the House of Commons, and the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is
Minister for the Cabinet Office.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental functions
and the head of the judiciary (see p. 220). The
three Law Officers of the Crown advising the
UK Government are the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General (for England and
Wales) and the Advocate General for
Scotland.
Other Ministers
Ministers of State are middle-ranking
ministers. They normally have specific
responsibilities, and are sometimes given titles
which reflect these functions, for example,
‘Minister for School Standards’ and ‘Minister
for Energy and Industry’.
The most junior ministers are Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State (or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries). They may
be given responsibility, directly under the
departmental minister, for specific aspects of
the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from April 1999) range from
£25,319 a year for junior ministers to £64,307
for Cabinet ministers. In the House of Lords
salaries range from £55,631 for junior ministers
to £83,560 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime
Minister is entitled to a salary of £107,179.11
The Lord Chancellor receives £160,011.
In addition to their ministerial salaries,
ministers in the Commons, including the
Prime Minister, receive a full parliamentary
salary of £47,008 a year in recognition of their
constituency responsibilities and can claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.
11 The present Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues
have declined the full salary to which they are entitled; the
Prime Minister draws instead a salary of £62,760, while
Cabinet ministers in the Commons draw £47,149 and in the
Lords £70,608.
54
GOVERNMENT
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons receives a salary of £58,949 (and
also the full parliamentary salary of £47,008);
two Opposition whips in the Commons and
the Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive additional salaries.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by the
Prime Minister and may include both
departmental and non-departmental ministers.
The Cabinet reconciles ministers’ individual
responsibilities with their collective
responsibilities as members of the
Government. It is the ultimate arbiter of all
government policy.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential, although after 30
years Cabinet papers may be made available
for inspection in the Public Record Office at
Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets weekly during
parliamentary sittings, and less often when
Parliament is not sitting. Cabinet Committees
relieve the pressure on Cabinet itself by
settling business in a smaller forum or at a
lower level, when possible, or at least by
clarifying issues and defining points of
disagreement. Committees enable decisions to
be fully considered by those ministers most
closely concerned in a way that ensures that
the Government as a whole can be expected to
accept responsibility for them. They act by
implied devolution of authority from the
Cabinet and their decisions therefore have the
same formal status as decisions by the full
Cabinet.
There are Cabinet Committees dealing, for
example, with defence and overseas policy,
economic policy, home and social affairs, the
environment, and local government. A new
committee set up by the present Government,
the Joint Consultative Committee, became the
first to involve politicians from a party outside
the Government—the Liberal Democrats. The
Committee considers constitutional issues.
The membership and terms of reference of
all ministerial Cabinet Committees are
published. Where appropriate, the Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior Cabinet Office
officials attend meetings of the Cabinet and its
Committees.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, together with HM
Treasury and the Prime Minister’s Office, is
at the centre of the UK government.
The Secretary of the Cabinet (a civil servant
who reports directly to the Prime Minister)
manages the Cabinet Secretariats, which serve
ministers collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business and in the co-ordination of policy at
the highest level. Since 1983, the Cabinet
Secretary has had the additional role of Head
of the Home Civil Service.
The current Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is a Cabinet minister with the title
Minister for the Cabinet Office and has
ministerial responsibility for all parts of the
Cabinet Office except the Cabinet
Secretariats.
The Cabinet Office is responsible for:
• modernising and simplifying government
so that it works more effectively for the
benefit of the people;
• implementing a government programme
to improve the accessibility and quality of
public services; and
• providing the central strategic
management of the Civil Service.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
own departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that all ministers unanimously support
government policy once it has been settled.
The policy of departmental ministers must be
consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. Once the Government’s policy on
a matter has been decided, each minister is
55
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
expected to support it or resign. On rare
occasions, ministers have been allowed free
votes in Parliament on important issues of
principle or conscience. For example, free
votes were allowed in 1997 on prohibiting the
private ownership of handguns, and in 1998
on lowering the age of consent to homosexual
sex from 18 to 16.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they have a duty to Parliament to account, and
to be held to account, for the policies,
decisions and actions of their departments.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
many issues cross departmental boundaries
and require agreement between different
ministers. Proposals require consideration by
Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee where the
issue is one that raises major policy concerns, is
likely to lead to significant public comment or
criticism, or where the departmental ministers
concerned have been unable to agree.
On taking up office ministers must
generally resign directorships in private and
public companies, and must ensure that there
is no conflict between their public duties and
private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy and for advising ministers.
They are staffed by politically impartial civil
servants and generally receive their funds out
of money provided by Parliament. They often
work alongside local authorities, non-
departmental public bodies, and other
government-sponsored organisations.
The structure and functions of departments
sometimes change to meet the needs of major
changes in policy. A change of Government
does not necessarily affect the functions of
departments.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers the
UK as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others again, such as the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR), are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. (For
changes in responsibilities associated with
devolution, see chapters 3, 4 and 5.)
The nine Government Offices for the
Regions in England (see pp. 9-10) are
responsible for administering some of the
main programmes of the DETR, the
Department of Trade and Industry, and the
Department for Education and Employment.
They also link these where appropriate to the
programmes of other departments, some of
which have seconded staff to the Government
Offices. Some departments or agencies which
have direct contact with the public throughout
the country also have local offices.
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
were formally launched in eight English
regions on 1 April 1999. The ninth, in
London, will follow in 2000. They will
provide effective, properly co-ordinated
regional economic development and
regeneration, and enable the English regions
to improve their competitiveness relative to
their European counterparts.
Voluntary regional chambers have been
established in each region (see p. 10). The
chambers will provide a mechanism through
which the RDAs can consult on their proposals
and give an account of their activities.
Most departments are headed by ministers.
However, some non-ministerial departments
are headed by a permanent office holder and
ministers with other duties are accountable for
them to Parliament. For instance, the
Secretary of State for Education and
Employment accounts to Parliament for the
work of the Office for Standards in Education
(OFSTED). OFSTED is headed by HM
Chief Inspector of Schools in England, who is
largely independent of the Secretary of State.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out in
Appendix 1, pp. 531-9.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
A non-departmental public body (NDPB) is a
national or regional public body, operating
independently of ministers, but for which
ministers are ultimately accountable. Such
bodies are commonly referred to as ‘quangos’.
56
GOVERNMENT
There are two main categories of NDPB:
• Executive NDPBs are those with
executive, administrative, commercial or
regulatory functions. They are typically
engaged in a wide variety of activities and
are established in a number of different
ways. Executive NDPBs carry out
prescribed functions within a
government framework but the degree of
operational independence varies.
Examples include the Arts Council of
England, the Environment Agency and
the Health and Safety Executive.
• Advisory NDPBs are those set up by
ministers to advise them and their
departments on particular matters. They
are normally set up by administrative
action and are typically staffed by
officials from within the department
whose minister they advise. Examples
include the Committee on Standards in
Public Life and the Low Pay
Commission. Some Royal Commissions
are also classified as advisory
NDPBs.
Other categories of NDPB include certain
tribunals and boards of visitors to penal
establishments.
There are currently over 1,000 NDPBs in
the UK, spending around £24 billion (in the
1997-98 financial year). A list of all NDPBs is
held centrally by the Cabinet Office and is
issued annually in the publication Public
Bodies. An electronic directory of NDPBs is
also maintained on the Cabinet Office website
(www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/quango).
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman and
other staff in the Prime Minister’s Press
Office have direct contact with the
parliamentary press through regular meetings
with the Lobby correspondents. The Lobby
correspondents are a group of political
journalists with the special privilege of access
to the Lobby of the House of Commons,
where they can talk privately to government
ministers and other members of the House.
The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman is
the accepted channel through which
information about parliamentary business is
passed to the media.
Modernising Government
The Modernising Government White Paper was
published in March 1999. It sets out key
policies and principles underpinning the
Government’s long-term programme of
reform to modernise public services. It is
based on five key commitments:
• developing policies to achieve lasting
results rather than reacting to short-term
pressures;
• delivering public services to meet the
needs of citizens, rather than for the
convenience of service providers;
• providing efficient, high-quality public
services;
• ‘information age’ government using new
technology to meet the needs of citizens
and business; and
• valuing those who work in the public
service.
The Modernising Government Action Plan,
published in July 1999, lists 62 commitments
that were in the White Paper and the targets
which need to be met in order to achieve
them. New public service agreements (PSAs)
with government departments (see p. 402)
will be a way of measuring and monitoring the
effective implementation of these
commitments. Information on progress
against the PSAs will be published in March
2000. The Government has already begun to
implement a number of significant measures
to improve public services. These include:
• the establishment of the Centre for
Management and Policy Studies which
will be responsible for Civil Service-wide
training and development, and act as a
source of best practice in public service
governance. One of its priorities is to
design a joint training programme for
ministers and senior civil servants;
• a new system to ensure that the Cabinet
Office Regulatory Impact Unit must now
57
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
be consulted on any policy proposal likely
to impose a significant regulatory burden;
• appointment of an ‘information age’
Government representative at Board
level in each department and agency;
• electronic delivery of services—38% of
services are now available electronically
and a 100% target has been set for the
year 2008;
• a second round of the Invest to Save
budget has been launched which allows
public service organisations to bid for
money to develop projects to deliver
better services to their users;
• new ‘learning labs1 are to be established
to encourage front-line staff who deal
with the public to test new ways of
working by suspending rules that stifle
innovation; and
• new arrangements to encourage diversity
(including ethnic background, disability,
level of qualification, and gender) in Civil
Service staffing.
Open Government
The Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information commits
government departments, agencies and
executive public bodies within the jurisdiction
of the Parliamentary Ombudsman to volunteer
information, such as facts and analysis behind
major policy decisions, and to answer requests
for information.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman (see p. 52)
offers an independent appeals mechanism for
those seeking information under the Code
who are dissatisfied with the response to their
enquiry and with the results of any internal
review of the original decision. Complaints to
the Parliamentary Ombudsman must be
referred through an MP.
Freedom of Information
As a major step towards fulfilling its
commitment to greater openness in the public
sector and involving people more in decisions
which affect their lives, the Government
published a draft Freedom of Information Bill
and consultation paper in May 1999. The
proposals in the draft Bill follow the general
principles set out in the 1997 White Paper
Your Right to Know, but depart from it in
some respects: a more open environment than
envisaged is proposed in certain areas, while
the legislation would go slightly less far in
others where the original proposals were later
felt to be detrimental to the effective conduct
of government.
The draft Bill is intended to supersede the
non-statutory Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information, creating a
statutory right of access to recorded
information held by public authorities. It also
aims to weight the scales decisively in favour
of openness and preserve confidentiality only
where disclosure would be against the public
interest.
The main provisions of the draft Bill are:
• a right of wide general access, subject to
clearly defined exemptions and
conditions;
• a requirement to consider discretionary
disclosure in the public interest even
when an exemption applies;
• a duty to publish information; and
• strong powers of enforcement through an
independent information commissioner
and Information Tribunal.
There will also be a requirement imposed on:
• police forces to give out information
about the conduct of inquiries (provided
it does not prejudice law enforcement);
• schools to explain how they apply their
admissions criteria;
• health authorities to provide details of
how they allocate resources between
different treatments;
• the Prison Service to provide information
on the performance of different regimes;
• hospitals and general practitioners to
explain how they prioritise their waiting
lists; and
58
GOVERNMENT
• National Health Service (NHS) Trusts
and health authorities to provide
information on the administrative
procedures that govern their private
finance initiatives.
Independent National Statistical Service
A further element in the government
programme of constitutional reform is the
creation of an independent national statistical
service. A Green Paper was published in 1998
with the intention of opening up debate on the
best arrangements for ensuring high-quality
statistics, driven by the requirements of all
users and which are efficiently produced,
compiled and presented free from political
interference. The Government is proposing to
follow up this consultation with a White
Paper.
Service First
In 1998, following a wide-ranging review, the
Government launched Service First as part of
its agenda to modernise government. Service
First defines the principles of good public
service delivery, including: setting clear
standards of service; consultation with users;
a well-publicised and easy-to-use complaints
procedure; and closer working with other
providers to ensure better services which are
simple to use and well co-ordinated.
Service First applies to all public services,
at both national and local level, and to those
privatised utilities retaining a monopoly
element. In support of the programme, a range
of guides has been produced covering issues
such as drawing up a charter, consultation,
and complaints handling. Other key elements
of the programme include:
• the Charter Mark Award Scheme, which
rewards excellence in delivering public
services;
• The People’s Panel, which consists of
5,000 members of the public randomly
selected from across the UK, to provide
views on public service delivery from a
cross-section of the population; and
• Better Government for Older People, which
aims to improve public services for older
people by better meeting their needs,
listening to their views, and recognising
their contribution to society.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
This Committee was set up in 1994 against a
background of increasing public concern
about standards in many areas of public life.
The Committee’s terms of reference are ‘to
examine current concerns about standards of
conduct of all holders of public office,
including arrangements relating to financial
and commercial activities, and make
recommendations as to any changes in present
arrangements which might be required to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in
public life’.
The Committee has published five reports
(see Further Reading). The first, in 1995, was
about MPs, ministers and civil servants, and
NDPBs. This led to the appointment of a
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
(see p. 52) and a Commissioner for Public
Appointments (see p. 60).
Reports in 1996 and 1997 examined
standards of conduct in local public spending
bodies and conduct in local government, and
called for a radical change in the ethical
framework within which local government
operates. A proposal was made for a new
statutory criminal offence of misuse of public
office and progress on implementing some of
its earlier recommendations was reviewed.
In 1997 the Prime Minister gave the
Committee additional terms of reference to
review the funding of political parties. The
Committee’s report, published in 1998, called
for a new regulatory regime, overseen by an
independent Election Commission, for
political party funding in the UK, and in July
1999 the Government published a White
Paper (see p. 46), containing proposals to
make party funding more transparent and
control spending on elections.
In March 1999, the Committee published a
consultation paper setting out some of the
issues and questions it proposed to consider in
its review of recommendations in its First
59
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Report. The review will cover MPs, ministers
and civil servants, and procedures in making
public appointments which are appropriate to
the nature of the post and weight of
responsibility. The report will be published
towards the end of 1999.
Commissioner for Public Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments,
who is independent of government, is
responsible for monitoring, regulating and
auditing approximately 16,000 ministerial
appointments to a range of public bodies
including NDPBs, public corporations,
nationalised industries and NHS Trusts. The
Commissioner has issued a Code of Practice
which encompasses the seven principles to be
applied to these appointments—ministerial
responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny,
equal opportunities, probity, openness and
transparency, and proportionality. An annual
report is published.
Civil Service Commissioners
The Civil Service Commissioners are
responsible for upholding the fundamental
principle, in the context of recruitment to the
Civil Service, that selection should be solely
on merit on the basis of fair and open
competition. The Commissioners, who are
independent of government, produce a
mandatory Recruitment Code and audit the
recruitment policies and practices of
departments and agencies to ensure
compliance. They are also responsible for
approving appointments through external
recruitment to the Senior Civil Service, and
for hearing and determining appeals in cases
of concern about propriety and conscience
under the Civil Service Code. The
Commissioners publish an annual report.
The Civil Service
The constitutional and practical role of the
Civil Service is to assist the duly constituted
Government of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Executive or the National Assembly
for Wales in formulating their policies,
carrying out decisions and administering
public services for which they are responsible.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown; in
effect this means the Government of the
United Kingdom, the Scottish Executive and
the National Assembly for Wales. The
executive powers of the Crown are generally
exercised by ministers of the Crown, Scottish
ministers and secretaries of the National
Assembly for Wales, who are in turn
answerable to the appropriate Parliament or
Assembly. The Civil Service as such has no
separate constitutional personality or
responsibility. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the minister or
Assembly secretary in charge of the
department in which he or she is serving. A
change of minister, for whatever reason, does
not involve a change of staff.
Cabinet ministers may appoint special
advisers from outside the Civil Service.
(There are about 70 such advisers in the
present administration.) The advisers are
normally paid from public funds, but their
appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or when
the appointing minister leaves the
Government or moves to another
appointment.
The Civil Service Code, first introduced in
1996, is a concise statement of the role and
responsibilities of civil servants. It was revised
in May 1999 to take account of devolution.
The Code includes an independent line of
appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on
alleged breaches of the Code.
Civil servants constitute about 2% of the
working population in employment, and about
10% of all public sector employees. The
number of permanent civil servants fell from
751,000 in 1976 to 463,000 in April 1998 (a
decrease of 38%). These figures include the
Senior Civil Service, which comprises around
3,000 of the most senior managers and policy
advisers.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in providing services to the public. These
include paying benefits and pensions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, issuing
driving licences, and providing services to
industry and agriculture. A further quarter are

GOVERNMENT
employed in the Ministry of Defence and its
agencies. The rest are divided between
central administrative and policy duties;
support services; and largely financially
self-supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Royal Mint. Four-fifths of civil
servants work outside London. Roughly 13,000
civil servants work in the Scottish Executive
and 2,000 in the National Assembly for Wales.
Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain,
and has its own Civil Service Commission.
There were 22,600 civil servants in the NICS at
1 April 1998. There is a degree of mobility
between the NICS and the Home Civil Service.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 5,450 people, provides staff for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO—see
p. 96) in London and at British diplomatic
missions abroad.
Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the FCO and at overseas posts on loan
or attachment.
Equality and Diversity
The Civil Service aims to create a culture in
which the different skills, experience and
expertise that individuals bring are valued and
used. Its equal opportunities policy provides
that there must be no unfair discrimination on
the basis of age, disability, gender, marital
status, sexual orientation, race, colour,
nationality or (in Northern Ireland)
community background. The Civil Service is
committed to achieving greater diversity,
particularly at senior levels, where women,
people from ethnic minorities and those with
disabilities are still under-represented.
Addressing this is a top priority.
In April 1998, the overall proportion of
women in the Civil Service was 51%; ethnic
minority representation was 5.7%, compared
with 5.4% in the economically active
population; and at least 4.1% of staff
employed were disabled. Progress is
monitored and reported on regularly by the
Cabinet Office.
Central Management
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service lies with the
Prime Minister as Minister for the Civil
Service, supported by the Cabinet Office. The
Cabinet Office oversees the central framework
for management of the Civil Service. Day-to-
day responsibility for a wide range of terms
and conditions is delegated to departments
and agencies under the Civil Service
(Management Functions) Act 1992.
The function of official Head of the Home
Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary of the Cabinet.
Executive Agencies
Executive agencies were introduced to deliver
government services more efficiently and
effectively within available resources for the
benefit of taxpayers, customers and staff. This
involved setting up, as far as is practicable,
separate units or agencies to perform the
executive functions of government. Agencies
remain part of the Civil Service, but under the
terms of individual framework documents
they enjoy greater delegation of financial, pay
and personnel matters. Agencies are headed
by chief executives who are normally directly
accountable to ministers but are personally
responsible for day-to-day operations. A chief
executive’s pay is normally directly related to
the agency’s performance.
No organisation carrying out a government
function can become an agency until the ‘prior
options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed,
normally after five years of operation.
By April 1998, 355,900 civil servants (77%)
were working in executive agencies.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Local Government
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities derive their power from
legislation. They can act only under powers
conferred on them by Acts of Parliament. If
these powers are exceeded, the local authority
concerned can be challenged in a court of law.
Local authorities’ functions are far-reaching.
Some are mandatory, which means that the
authority must do what is required by law;
others are purely permissive, allowing an
authority to provide services if it wishes. In
certain services, ministers have powers to
secure a degree of uniformity in standards in
order to safeguard public health or to protect
the rights of individual citizens.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions. However, other departments,
such as the Department for Education and
Employment, the Department of Health and
the Home Office, are also concerned with
various local government functions. In
Scotland and Wales, local authorities now deal
mainly with the new devolved Parliament and
Assembly. In Northern Ireland they continue
to deal with the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland until the
new Northern Ireland Assembly begins to
function fully.
Closer links between central and local
government in England have been promoted
through the Central-Local Partnership
Meeting, which brings together Cabinet
ministers and senior local government leaders
to discuss major issues affecting local
government.
In 1998 the Government ratified the
Council of Europe’s Charter of Local Self
Government. This lays down standards for
protecting and developing the rights of local
authorities.
Reform of Local Government Structure
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and Wales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created two main tiers of local
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and
districts on the mainland; single-tier
authorities were introduced for the three
Islands areas. In Northern Ireland changes
were made in 1973 which replaced the two-
tier county council and urban/rural council
system with a single-tier district council
system.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Recent Changes
Further restructuring of local government has
since taken place in non-metropolitan England
and in Scotland and Wales. In 1992 the Local
Government Commission was established to
review the structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England
and to undertake periodic electoral reviews. In
its structural reviews of local government in
non-metropolitan England, the Commission
considered whether the two-tier structure
should be replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’)
authorities in each area; for the most part it
recommended the retention of two-tier
government, but suggested unitary authorities
for some areas, especially the larger cities.
Parliament approved reorganisation in 25
counties, creating a total of 46 new unitary
councils (see map on p. 8). Implementation
was completed in 1998.
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils
replaced the previous system of nine regional
and 53 district councils in 1996; the three
Islands councils have remained in being. In
Wales, 22 unitary authorities replaced the
previous eight county councils and 37 district
councils, again in 1996.
In 1998 the Government published White
Papers for modernising local government in
England (Modern Local Government: In Touch
with the People) and Wales (Local Voices:
Modernising Local Government in Wales). The
62
GOVERNMENT
White Papers contained proposals for: creating
new political structures for councils (see p. 64);
improving local democracy (see p. 64);
strengthening local financial accountability;
establishing a new ethical framework; improving
local services through best value (see p. 66);
simplifying capital finance; and introducing
some local discretion in business rates. The
Local Government Act 1999 abolished
compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) and
imposed a new duty on authorities to make
arrangements to achieve best value (see p. 66).
The Act also repealed the existing legislation to
cap local authority budgets, replacing it with
more discriminating reserve powers.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Greater London
Greater London is made up of the 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, each with a
council responsible for all local government
services in its area. Exceptions include public
transport, responsibility for which lies with
London Transport (see p. 367), and London’s
Metropolitan Police force, which at present is
responsible to the Home Secretary. (For
details of the police service, which is financed
by central and local government, see p. 217.)
Proposals for London Government
At present London is the only Western capital
without an elected city-wide government. In
1997 the Government issued proposals for
establishing a Greater London Authority
made up of an elected Mayor and a separately
elected Assembly. The proposed Authority,
which would encompass the whole of Greater
London, would not duplicate the work of the
London boroughs, but would take
responsibility for London-wide issues such as
transport, economic development,
environmental protection, strategic planning,
police and fire services. The Corporation of
the City of London has produced its own
proposals for reforming its existing franchise
in order to prevent abuse of power and to
extend the electoral system to give a wider
variety of bodies and organisations voting
rights within the City.
In a referendum held in Greater London in
1998, a majority of those who voted cast their
votes in favour of the Government’s proposals.
The new Authority will be set up, subject to
parliamentary approval, under the provisions of
the Greater London Authority Bill, with a view
to holding the first elections for the Mayor and
Assembly in May 2000 and assuming its
responsibilities in July that year. Subsequent
elections will take place every four years.
English Metropolitan County Areas
The six metropolitan county areas—Tyne and
Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire—have 36 district councils, but no
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those
which require a statutory authority over areas
wider than the individual boroughs and
districts—namely, waste disposal (in certain
areas); the fire services, including civil defence;
and public transport. These are run by joint
authorities composed of elected councillors
nominated by the borough or district councils.
English Non-metropolitan Counties
Before the recent reforms, local government in
England—outside Greater London and the
metropolitan areas—was divided into counties
and sub-divided into districts. All the counties
and districts had locally elected councils with
separate functions. County councils provided
large-scale services, while district councils
were responsible for the more local ones.
These arrangements are broadly continuing in
areas where two-tier local government remains.
County councils are responsible for
transport, planning, highways, traffic
regulation, education,12 consumer protection,
refuse disposal, the fire service, libraries and
12 Under the Education Reform Act 1988, schools were
able to ‘opt out’ of local education authority control by
obtaining grant-maintained (GM) status. However, the
School Standards and Framework Act 1998 introduced a
new framework under which GM schools returned to the
local authority sector: from April 1999 they have been
funded by local education authorities and they will move to
their chosen new status—foundation, voluntary or
community—from September 1999 (see p. 125).
63
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
the personal social services. District councils
are responsible for environmental health,
housing, decisions on most local planning
applications, and refuse collection. Both tiers
of local authority have powers to provide
facilities such as museums, art galleries and
parks; arrangements depend on local
agreement. In areas where the new unitary
authorities have been set up, county and
district level functions have merged.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 10,000 parish
councils or meetings provide and manage local
facilities such as allotments and village halls,
and act as agents for other district council
functions. They also provide a forum for
discussion of local issues.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
In Scotland the 32 single-tier councils are
responsible for the full range of local
government services. In Wales the 22 single¬
tier councils have similar functions, except
that fire services are provided by three
combined fire authorities. In addition, about
750 community councils in Wales have
functions similar to those of the parish
councils in England (see above); in Scotland
community councils exist to represent the
views of their local communities to local
authorities and other public bodies in the area.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for local environmental and
certain other services, such as leisure and the
arts. Responsibility for planning, roads, water
supply and sewerage services is currently
exercised in each district through a divisional
office of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland. Area boards, responsible
to central departments, administer education,
public libraries, and the health and personal
social services locally.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
In England and Wales each council elects its
presiding officer annually. Some districts have
the ceremonial title of borough, or city, both
granted by royal authority. In boroughs and
Fire Services in the UK
Every part of the UK is covered by a local
authority fire service. Each of the 64 fire
authorities must by law make provision for
firefighting and maintain a brigade to meet
efficiently all normal firefighting
requirements. Each fire authority appoints
a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in
Scotland) who exercises day-to-day
control from brigade headquarters. The
fire services in England and Wales employ
some 50,000 staff and spend around £1.4
billion each year. In 1998 local authority
fire brigades attended about 865,000 fires
or false alarms in the UK.
cities the presiding officer is normally known
as the Mayor. In the City of London and
certain large cities, he or she is known as the
Lord Mayor. In Scotland the presiding officer
of the council of each of the four cities—
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and
Glasgow—is called the Lord Provost.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England, borough councils
in London, and about two-thirds of non¬
metropolitan district councils are elected in
their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all metropolitan
districts) one-third of the councillors are
elected in each of the three years when county
council elections are not held. In the interests
of greater accountability, the recent White
Paper (see p. 62) proposes that all unitary
authorities in non-metropolitan districts and
London boroughs should adopt a pattern of
elections similar to that in metropolitan
districts. It also proposes that other authorities
should adopt arrangements where, in alternate
years, elections take place for half of the
district council and then, in the following
year, half of the county council.
In Scotland whole council elections are
held every three years, with the next elections
due in 2002. In Wales whole council elections
are held every fourth year, with the next due
in 2003. The Government has given the
National Assembly for Wales a power to
determine the frequency of council elections.
64
GOVERNMENT
County, district and unitary authority
councillors are paid a basic allowance but may
also be entitled to additional allowances and
expenses for attending meetings or taking on
special responsibilities. The Government
proposes to abolish attendance allowance and
make possible the payment of pensionable
salaries to some councillors in executive
positions in the proposed new political
management structures.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in the UK provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of the UK or of another
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or a citizen of a member state
of the European Union;
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote;
and
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of a
member state of the European Union, and aged
21 or over. In addition, they must also either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land
or premises in that area during the whole
of the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Areas and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland are
divided into wards, returning one councillor
or more. In Scotland the unitary councils are
divided into wards and in Wales into electoral
divisions; each returns one councillor or more.
Parishes (in England) and communities (in
Wales) may be divided into wards, returning
at least one councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
district councils are elected by proportional
representation on the grounds that it allows
for the representation of sizeable minorities.
The electoral arrangements of local
authorities in England are kept under review
by the Local Government Commission (see
p. 62), and in Wales and Scotland by the Local
Government Boundary Commissions. Under
legislation passed in 1997, electoral
arrangements in England and Wales for
parishes and communities can be reviewed by
local councils.
Provision of Local Services
In recent years, there has been a move away
from direct service provision, to a greater use
of private contractors, and an increase in what
is often called the ‘enabling’ role. Local
authorities now carry out many functions in
partnership with both public and private
organisations. For example, under community
care arrangements (see p. 164), councils with
social services responsibilities draw up care
plans for those who need them, but the care is
often provided by the private or voluntary
sectors funded by the council rather than
directly by the local authority itself.
The previous administration introduced
legislation in the 1980s aimed at encouraging
local authorities to contract out the services
they provide. It introduced a practice known
as compulsory competitive tendering (CCT),
under which many services traditionally
provided by the council’s own staff, such as
refuse collection and leisure management, had
to be put out to tender and won in open
competition.
65
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
In a departure from the approach of its
predecessor, the Government has devised a
new system designed to achieve best value in
the delivery of local government services. It
considers that councils should not be forced to
put their services out to tender, but equally it
sees no reason why a service should be
delivered directly if more efficient means are
available elsewhere. The Government has
incorporated provisions in the Local
Government Act 1999 to replace CCT with a
duty on local authorities to achieve best value.
The Best Value programme aims to
encourage local accountability and involve
local communities in deciding the quality,
level and cost of local services. Local
authorities will be expected to set themselves
challenging targets for the improvement of
services following regular reviews of their
performance. Local people will be able to see
how well their authority is performing
through the publication of annual
performance plans.
A White Paper containing proposals for
modernising local government in Wales was
published in 1998. The Government of Wales
Act (see p. 27) requires the National Assembly
to set up a Partnership Council to oversee
relations between the Assembly and local
government. A Commission to establish
effective relations between local government
and the new Scottish Parliament has been set
up (see chapter 4).
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom to
make arrangements for carrying out their
duties. Some decisions are made by the full
council; many other matters are delegated to
committees composed of members of the
council, although certain powers are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales are
often able to do their work in full session,
although they appoint committees from time
to time as necessary.
In England and Wales committees
generally have to reflect the political
composition of the council (although the
legislation governing this specifically excludes
parish or community councils). In practice,
this is the case in Scotland, although it is not
enforced by legislation. People who are not
members of the council may be co-opted onto
decision-making committees and can speak
and take part in debates; they cannot normally
vote. Legislation also prevents senior council
officers and others in politically sensitive posts
from being members of another local authority
or undertaking public political activity. Some,
but not all, of these provisions have been
introduced in Northern Ireland.
The recent local government White Papers
(see p. 62) criticised these arrangements for
producing a lack of openness, for being
inefficient, and for preventing councillors
from spending more time with those they
represent. The Government has proposed a
separation between the executive and the back
bench role of councillors, and has suggested a
range of models which would achieve this,
including ones featuring directly elected
mayors.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have access to agendas, reports
and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and
withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
About 1.9 million people13 are employed by
local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and
technical staff, teachers, fire-fighters and
manual workers, but exclude those in law and
order services. Education is the largest
service. Councils are individually responsible,
within certain national legislative
requirements, for deciding the structure of
their workforces.
Senior staff appointments are usually made
by the elected councillors. More junior

GOVERNMENT
appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of service are
usually a matter for each council, although most
authorities follow the scales recommended as a
result of national negotiation between
authorities and trade unions.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25% of public spending. In 1998-99
expenditure by local authorities in the UK was
about £79.1 billion. Current expenditure
amounted to £70.7 billion; capital
expenditure, net of capital receipts, was £5.6
billion; and debt interest £4.4 billion. Local
government capital expenditure is financed
primarily by borrowing within limits set by
central government and from capital receipts
from the disposal of land and buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax (see chapter
24), which meets about 20% of their revenue
expenditure. Their spending is, however,
financed primarily by grants from central
government and by the redistribution of
revenue from the national non-domestic rate,
a property tax levied on businesses and other
non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be audited
by independent auditors appointed by the Audit
Commission in England and Wales, or in
Scotland by the Accounts Commission for
Scotland. In Northern Ireland this role is
exercised by the chief local government auditor,
who, at present, is appointed by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Local electors have a right to inspect
the accounts to be audited. They may also ask
questions and lodge objections with the auditor.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their own
councillor for help in this. Local authorities
must also appoint a monitoring officer, whose
duties include ensuring that the local authority
acts lawfully in the conduct of its business.
Complaints of alleged local government
maladministration leading to injustice may be
investigated by independent Commissions for
Local Administration, often known as ‘the
Ombudsman service’. There are three
Ombudsmen in England, and one each in
Wales and Scotland. A report is issued on each
complaint fully investigated and, if injustice
caused by maladministration is found, the

local Ombudsman normally proposes a
remedy. The council must consider the report
and reply to it. In 1998—99 the local
government Ombudsmen for England
received 15,869 complaints, 6% more than in
1997_98. Compensation or redress was
obtained or recommended in 4,268 cases
(27%). In Wales there were 1,134 complaints,
8% more than in 1997-98.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence the decision-making of
Parliament and Government, to the benefit of
their members and the causes they support.
There is a huge range of groups, covering
politics, business, employment, consumer
affairs, ethnic minorities, aid to developing
countries, foreign relations, education,
culture, defence, religion, sport, transport,
social welfare, animal welfare and the
environment. Some have over 1 million
members, others only a few dozen. Some exert
pressure on a number of different issues;
others are concerned with a single issue. Some
have come to play a recognised role in the way
the UK is governed; others seek influence
through radical protest.
Pressure Groups and Policy
Pressure groups operating at a national level
have a number of methods for influencing the
way the UK is governed. Their action may
highlight a particular problem, which is then
acknowledged by the Government. Groups
whose scale of membership indicates that they
are broadly representative in their field may
then be consulted by a government
department, or take part in Whitehall working
groups or advisory councils. Ministers have a
duty to give fair consideration and due weight
to informed and impartial advice from civil
servants, so pressure groups often seek to
inform civil servants and thus influence the
advice given to ministers.
Pressure Groups and Government
The principle of consultation to gain the
consent and co-operation of as wide a range of
organisations as possible, and ensure the
smooth working of laws and regulations, plays
an important part in the relationship between
government departments and interested
groups.
In some instances a department is under
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and that they observe confidentiality
about their discussions with the department.
Members of pressure groups often have direct
expertise, and an awareness of what is
practicable, and can give advice and
information to civil servants engaged in
preparing policy or legislation. In return, the
pressure groups have the opportunity to
express their opinions directly to the
Government. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter or
telephone—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Administration by Pressure Groups
The Government also makes grants to
pressure groups which, as well as speaking on
behalf of their members or for an issue,
provide a service. For example, Relate:
National Marriage Guidance has received
grants for the advice centres it runs, and
government departments make grants to a
number of pressure groups for research
relating to public policy.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—the practice of approaching MPs
or peers, persuading them to act on behalf of a
cause, and enabling them to do so by
providing advice and information—has
substantially increased in recent years. A
common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
68
THEN AND NOW - 1900 AND 1999
NORWICH
GOVERNMENT
about an issue—for example, the Sunday
trading laws, or the plight of political
prisoners in particular countries—in order to
raise awareness and persuade the MP to
support the cause.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
peers sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament.
There are also public relations and political
consultancy firms specialising in lobbying
Parliament and Government. Such firms are
employed by pressure groups—as well as by
British and overseas companies and
organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’
interests where they are affected by legislation
and debate.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or peers subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 49); many
pressure groups have ready-drafted
legislation waiting to be sponsored;
• approaching MPs or peers to ask
parliamentary questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 52) and suggesting to
peers subjects for debates; and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action.
The UK in the European
Union
As a member of the European Union (EU),
the UK is bound by the various types of
European Community (EC) legislation and
wider policies (for policies, see chapter 7).
Almost all UK government departments are
involved in EU-wide business, and EU
legislation is an increasingly important
element of government.
The Community enacts legislation which is
binding on the national governments of the 15
member states or, in certain circumstances, on
individuals and companies within those states.
British government ministers take part in the
discussions and decision-making, and the final
decision is taken collectively by all the
member states.
The UK Representative Office (UKREP),
based in Brussels, conducts most of the
negotiations on behalf of the UK
Government. The devolved administrations of
Scotland and Wales are also represented by
UKREP, although in October 1999 a new
office specifically aimed at helping to promote
Scotland’s interests within the EU will be
opened in Brussels.
The EU has three legislative bodies:
The Council of the European Union is
the main decision-making body. Member
states are represented by the ministers
appropriate to the subject under discussion.
When, for instance, education matters are
being discussed, the UK’s Secretary of State
for Education and Employment attends with
his or her European counterparts. The
Presidency of the Council changes at six-
monthly intervals and rotates in turn among
the 15 member states of the Union.
The European Council, which is not a
legislative body and which usually meets twice
a year, comprises the heads of State or
Government accompanied by their foreign
ministers and the President of the European
Commission and one other Commissioner.
The Council defines general political
guidelines and has an important role in
common foreign and security policy.
The European Commission is the
executive of the EU. It implements the
Council’s decisions, initiates EC legislation
and ensures that member states put it into
effect. Each of the 20 Commissioners, who are
drawn from all member states (there are two
from the UK), is responsible for a specific
policy area, for example, education, transport
69
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
or agriculture. The Commissioners are
entirely independent of their countries, and
serve the EU as a whole.
The European Parliament, which plays
an increasingly important role in the EU
legislative process, has 626 directly elected
members (MEPs), including 87 from the
UK. The Parliament is consulted about
major decisions and has substantial shared
power with the Council of the European
Union over the EC budget. In areas of
legislation, its role varies between:
consultation, where it can influence but does
not have the final say in the content of
legislation; the co-operation and assent
procedures, where its influence is greater;
and codecision (introduced by the Maastricht
Treaty and extended in the Amsterdam
Treaty—see chapter 7), where a proposal
requires the agreement of both the Council
and the European Parliament.
Elections to the Parliament take place every
five years, most recently in June 1999. In the
UK, these were held under a proportional
voting system,14 bringing the country in line
with the other member states.
The European Parliament meets in full
session in Strasbourg for about one week every
month, although its committee work normally
takes place in Brussels.
EC legislation is issued in some areas
jointly by the Council of the European Union
and the European Parliament, by the Council
in other areas, or by the Commission under
delegated powers. It consists of Regulations,
Directives and Decisions.
14 The regional list system is used for England, Scotland
and Wales, under which an elector may cast his or her vote
for a party list of candidates. England is divided into nine
regions while Scotland and Wales each constitute one
region. These 11 regions each return between four and 11
MEPs, depending on the size of the electorate of each
region. Northern Ireland, which also constitutes one region,
continues to use the single transferable vote system to
return its three MEPs.

• Regulations are directly applicable in all
member states, and have the force of law
without the need for implementing
further measures;
• Directives are equally binding as to the
result to be achieved but allow each
member state to choose the form and
method of implementation; and
• Decisions, like Regulations, do not
normally need national implementing
legislation. They are binding on those to
whom they are addressed.
Other EU Institutions
Each member state provides one of the judges
to serve in the European Court of Justice,
which is the final authority on all aspects of
Community law. Its rulings must be applied
by member states, and fines can be imposed
on those failing to do so. The Court is assisted
by a Court of First Instance, which handles
certain cases brought by individuals and
companies. The UK is also represented on the
Court of Auditors, which examines
Community revenue and expenditure, to see
that it is legally received and spent.

The aims of British foreign policy are to promote the interests of the United
Kingdom abroad and to contribute to a strong international community. The
UK is one of the 15 member states of the European Union, and a founding
member of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). It also has a
central position in the Commonwealth and in the United Nations Security
Council.
In 1999 the UK played an important role in NATO’s military action in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to stop Serbian repression and displacement of
the ethnic Albanian population in the province of Kosovo, and in the
subsequent establishment of a safe environment in which Albanian Kosovar
refugees could return to their homes.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
Active membership of the United Nations
(UN), the European Union (EU), the
Commonwealth, NATO, the Western
European Union (WEU) and other major
international organisations remains central to
the British Government’s foreign policy
objectives.
United Nations
The UK is a founder member of the UN and
one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, along with China, France,
Russia and the United States. It supports the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
including the maintenance of international
peace and security, the development of
friendly relations among nations, the
achievement of international co-operation on
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues and the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
The UK is the sixth largest contributor to
the UN regular budget (just over 5% in 1998)
and the fifth largest contributor to
peacekeeping operations (see p. 88). In order
to enhance the UN’s effectiveness, the UK is
pressing for comprehensive institutional and
financial reform. It encourages all member
states to pay their contributions promptly and

in full, and has also taken a leading role in
negotiations to speed up payment of arrears by
improving incentives for prompt payers and
tightening penalties on late payers. The UK
supports early enlargement of the Security
Council to make its membership more
representative of the world today.
European Union
The UK is a member of the EU (see also
pp. 69 and 79-83), which comprises the
European Community (EC—covering a
variety of policy areas including economic,
environmental and social issues) and
intergovernmental co-operation on foreign
and security policy and on justice and home
affairs. The EU has 15 member nations—
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and the UK (with the prospect
of many more members in the near future).
The Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,
including the UK. It is a voluntary association
of independent states, nearly all of which were
once British territories, and includes almost
one in three people in the world. The
members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia,
the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Cameroon,
Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia,
Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica,
Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia,
Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Nauru,1 New Zealand, Nigeria,2
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, St Kitts and
Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad
1 Nauru became a full member of the Commonwealth in
May 1999.
2 Having been suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995
because of political repression and human rights abuses,
Nigeria resumed full membership in May 1999 upon the
completion of its transition to democracy.
and Tobago, Tuvalu,3 Uganda, United
Kingdom, Vanuatu, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The Queen is head of the Commonwealth
and is head of state in the UK and 15 other
member countries. The next biennial
Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting will be held in Durban, South Africa,
in November 1999.
The Commonwealth Secretariat, based in
London, is the main agency for multilateral
communication between member
governments on matters relevant to the
Commonwealth as a whole. The Secretariat
promotes consultation and co-operation,
disseminates information, and helps host
governments to organise Heads of
Government Meetings, ministerial meetings
and other conferences. It administers
assistance programmes agreed at these
meetings, including the Commonwealth Fund
for Technical Co-operation, which provides
advisory services and training to
Commonwealth developing countries.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to UK
defence policy (see p. 99). NATO’s functions
are to:
• provide security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area (linking European
security with that of North America);
• deter and defend against any threat to a
NATO member state;
• contribute to crisis management and
conflict prevention; and
• promote consultation between member
states on issues of common concern.
Each of the 19 member states—Belgium,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United
Kingdom and the United States—has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The Czech
3 Tuvalu is a ‘special’ member, entitled to take part in all
Commonwealth activities, with the exception of the biennial
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.

The Commonwealth
75
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Republic, Hungary and Poland joined the
Alliance as full members in March 1999. The
main decision-taking body is the North
Atlantic Council. It meets at least twice a year
at foreign minister level, and weekly at the
level of permanent representatives. Defence
ministers also meet at least twice a year.
Western European Union
The UK is a full member of the WEU, which
provides a forum for co-operation and
consultation on defence and security issues for
European nations. The WEU’s other full
members are Belgium, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. The Czech Republic,
Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland and
Turkey are associate members; Austria,
Denmark, Finland, the Irish Republic and
Sweden are observers. ‘Associate partnership’
has been extended to seven Central European
and Baltic states.
The Group of Eight
The UK is part of the Group of Eight (G8)
leading industrialised countries. The other
members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia (included as a full member from
1998) and the United States. The G8 is an
informal group with no secretariat. Its
Presidency rotates each year among the
members, the key meeting being an annual
summit of heads of government. Originally-
formed in 1975 (as the G7) to discuss
economic issues, the G8 agenda now includes
a wide range of foreign affairs and
international issues such as terrorism, nuclear
safety, the environment, UN reform and
development assistance. Heads of state or
government agree a communique issued at the
end of summits which commits each country
to co-ordinate individual action towards
common goals.
The 1999 G8 summit meeting was hosted
by Germany in Cologne in June. As well as
reviewing regional security issues (in
particular developments in Kosovo—see
p. 89), the summit focused on sustainable
economic growth, international trade,
education, social policy, support for developing
countries (especially debt relief—see also
p. 94), environmental concerns and
disarmament, within the context of increasing
globalisation.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The UK participates in the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
which is a pan-European organisation
comprising 54 states. All states participate on
an equal basis, and decisions are taken by
consensus. The OSCE is based in \ ienna,
where the UK has a permanent delegation.
The main areas of work are:
• early warning and prevention of potential
conflicts through field missions and
diplomacy and the work of the OSCE
High Commissioner on National
Minorities;
• observing elections and providing advice
on human rights, democracy and law (see
p. 92); and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence-building.
The OSCE is also the main instrument for
post-conflict rehabilitation.
Council of Europe
The UK is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
state accepting parliamentary democracy and
the protection of fundamental human rights
and the rule of law. There are 41 full member
states. ‘Special guest status’ has been granted
to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina (but suspended in the case of
Belarus). One of the Council’s main
achievements is its adoption of the European
Convention on Human Rights in 1950 (see
P- 211).
Other International Bodies
The UK belongs to many other international
bodies, and was a founder member of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
76
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
World Bank. The IMF regulates the
international financial system and provides
credit for member countries facing balance-of-
payments difficulties. The World Bank
provides loans to finance economic and social
projects in developing countries.
The UK is also a member of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO—see p. 419), and
of the Organisation for Economic Co¬
operation and Development (OECD), which
promotes economic growth, support for less
developed countries and worldwide trade
expansion. Other organisations to which
Britain belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
OVERSEAS TERRITORIES
The UK’s Overseas Territories (formerly the
Dependent Territories) have a combined
population of nearly 180,000. The territories
are listed on p. 78. Most have considerable
self-government, with their own legislatures.
Governors appointed by the Queen are
generally responsible for external affairs,
internal security and defence. Certain
responsibilities are delegated to locally elected
representatives but the ultimate responsibility
for government rests with British ministers.
The British Indian Ocean Territory, the
British Antarctic Territory, and South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have
non-resident Commissioners, not Governors.
The UK aims to provide the Overseas
Territories with security and political stability,
ensure efficient and honest government, and
help them achieve economic and social
advancement. None of the territories has yet
expressed a desire for independence from
Britain.
A new Overseas Territories Department
within the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO—see p. 96) provides a single focus and
direct point of contact with the UK
Government, although Gibraltar, because of
its EU status (see p. 79), is dealt with
primarily by the FCO’s European
Departments. The Department for
International Development (DFID—see
In March 1999 the Government published
a White Paper, Partnership for Progress and
Prosperity, setting out the results of a
review of the relationship between the UK
and the Overseas Territories. The White
Paper proposes offering British citizenship
to all those residents of the Overseas
Territories who do not already have it and
who wish to take it up,4 and confirms that
the reasonable assistance needs of the
territories are a first call on the UK
development aid programme (see p. 93).
Overseas Territories are required to match
high international standards in the
regulation of financial services by the end
of 1999, and must abide by the same
standards of human rights and good
governance to which the UK subscribes.
The Government also proposes an
Environment Charter between the UK and
the Overseas Territories to build their
capacity to protect their environment,
manage their resources and ensure that
Britain can fully reflect their interests in
international agreements.
p. 93) has also set up an Overseas Territories
Unit, which administers aid to Anguilla, the
British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, the Turks
and Caicos Islands, St Helena (and its
dependencies) and Pitcairn. A new Council of
the Territories, including the Chief Minister
or equivalent in each territory and chaired by
the relevant FCO minister, convenes its first
meeting later in 1999.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina. The UK
Government does not accept the Argentine
claim and is committed to defending the
4 The offer of right of abode will be on a non-reciprocal
basis, as the territories do not have the capacity to absorb
uncontrolled numbers of new residents. The UK
Government’s decision on this follows the precedent set by
Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands whose existing right of
abode is also non-reciprocal.

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Islanders’ right to live under a government of
their own choice. The inhabitants wish to
remain under British sovereignty and this
right of self-determination is enshrined in the
1985 Falkland Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied
the Islands, but its forces were expelled by
British troops following Argentina’s failure to
abide by UN resolutions requesting its forces
to withdraw. The UK and Argentina, while
sticking to their respective positions on
sovereignty, maintain diplomatic relations and
continue to discuss their common interests in
the South Atlantic region, such as fisheries
conservation and the exploitation of oil
reserves.
Gibraltar
Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in perpetuity
under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht but has long
sought its return. However, the UK is firmly
committed to the principle, set out in the
preamble to the 1969 Gibraltar Constitution,
that it will never enter into arrangements
under which the people of Gibraltar would
pass under the sovereignty of another state
against their freely and democratically
expressed wishes.
Gibraltar has an elected House of
Assembly, and responsibility for a wide range
of‘defined domestic matters’ is devolved to
elected local ministers. The territory is within
the EU, as part of the United Kingdom
member state, although it is outside the
common customs system and does not
participate in the Common Agricultural or
Fisheries Policies or the EU’s value added tax
arrangements. The people of Gibraltar have
been declared UK nationals for EU purposes.
EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
The UK Government aims to play a leading
role in Europe and increase the UK’s political
influence in the EU. Relationships with other
member states have been reinforced (see box)
and the UK has recently launched joint
initiatives with Germany, France, Spain, Italy
and Sweden. The Government is also keen to
make the EU and its institutions more
accessible and relevant to the public in the
UK. Britain’s priorities in Europe include
creating jobs, enlargement and institutional
reform.
Step Change Initiative
In September 1998 the Prime Minister
called for a stepping up of the UK’s
relations with the rest of Europe, to form
ever stronger links with the EU and
applicant countries in order to emphasise
Britain’s central place in the Union. The
aims of this longer-term initiative are to
maximise British influence in Europe,
build alliances to promote British interests,
and highlight the UK’s positive approach
towards Europe. A key element is to
intensify contacts at all levels by all UK
government departments and to encourage
joint initiatives.
The Treaties
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent further conflict and establish lasting
peace and stability.
Rome Treaty
The 1957 Rome Treaty, establishing the
European Community, defined its aims as the
harmonious development of economic
activities, a continuous and balanced economic
expansion and an accelerated rise in the
standard of living. These objectives were to be
achieved by the creation of a common internal
market, including the elimination of customs
duties between member states, free movement
of goods, people, services and capital, and the
elimination of distortions in competition
within this market. These aims were
reaffirmed by the 1986 Single European Act,
which agreed measures to complete the single
market (see p. 81). The UK joined the
European Community in 1973.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of the UK and
the other member states in international trade
negotiations. The Commission negotiates on a
mandate agreed by the European Council.

chapter 25.)
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union. It established
the EU, which comprises the European
Community and intergovernmental
arrangements for a Common Foreign and
Security Policy (CFSP—see p. 83) and for
increased co-operation on interior/justice policy
issues (see p. 84). The Maastricht Treaty also
codified the principle of subsidiarity under
which, in areas where the Community and
member states share competence, action should
be taken at European level only if its objectives
cannot be achieved by member states acting
alone and can be better achieved by the
Community. In addition, the Treaty introduced
the concept of EU citizenship as a supplement
to national citizenship.
Amsterdam Treaty
Following the Maastricht Treaty, an
intergovernmental conference was convened
in 1996 to consider further amendments. This
resulted in the Amsterdam Treaty, which was
signed by member states in 1997 and entered
into force in May 1999. Among the main
points are:
• provisions for the Council to take action
to combat discrimination on the basis of
gender, race, religion, sexual orientation,
disability or age;
• more co-ordination by member states of
measures designed to cut unemployment;
• integration of the social chapter (see
p. 82) into the Treaty, following its
adoption by the UK;
• new mechanisms to improve the co¬
ordination and effectiveness of the CFSP;
• an increase in the areas subject to co¬
decision between the Council of
Ministers and European Parliament, and
simplification of the co-decision
procedure (see p. 70);
• a binding protocol on subsidiarity; and
• measures to enhance openness in the EU
institutions.
Treaty Ratification
Any amendments to the Treaties must be
agreed unanimously and must then be ratified
by each member state according to its own
constitutional procedures. In the UK, Treaty
ratifications must be approved by Parliament
before they can come into force.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged economic and
monetary union in three stages. 1 he first,
establishment of the single market (see pp. 81
and 418-19), was largely achieved at the end of
1993. The second stage included the
establishment of a European Monetary Institute
(EMI) responsible for technical preparations for
stage 3 and for strengthening co-ordination of
member states’ monetary policy. Stage 3,
beginning on 1 January 1999, was the adoption
of a single currency (the euro).
In May 1998 a meeting of EU heads of state
and government agreed that 11 of the 15 EU
member states (excluding the UK, Denmark,
Greece and Sweden) would take part in the
single currency from its launch date. It also
agreed the establishment of the European
Central Bank (ECB) from June 1998.
On 1 January 1999 conversion rates
between currencies of qualifying countries and
the euro were legally fixed. The euro became
the legal currency in those countries and the
ECB assumed responsibility for formulating
the monetary policy of the euro area. Since no
euro banknotes or coins will be available until
1 January 2002, national currencies will
continue to exist in parallel to the euro and
national banknotes and coins will be used for
all cash transactions.
The UK Government’s policy towards
joining the single currency is described in
chapter 23 (p. 388).
Enlargement
Enlargement of the EU—to include those
European nations sharing its democratic
80
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
values and aims, which are functioning market
economies, able to compete in the EU and to
take on the obligations of membership—is a
key policy objective for the Union. In March
1998, an accession process with ten European
applicant states and Cyprus was launched and
formal accession negotiations started with
Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus
and the Czech Republic. Substantive
negotiations opened in November 1998 and
are progressing. Preparations for future
negotiations with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania and Slovakia to join the EU
continue, with the examination of their
national laws alongside the body of EU
legislation.
The EU is also preparing institutional
changes to take account of enlargement. An
important stage in this process was the
agreement reached at the Berlin European
Council in March 1999 on internal policy
reforms and a financial settlement for 2000-06
(see below). The Cologne European Council
in June 1999 agreed that an intergovernmental
conference in 2000 would decide the
remaining institutional changes necessary for
enlargement. These include the number of
Commissioners in an enlarged Union, the
weighting of votes in the Council and a review
of the issues which might be decided by
qualified majority voting.
The EU has recognised Turkey’s eligibility
for membership. It is pursuing closer political
and economic co-operation on the basis of a
strategy to prepare Turkey for membership
endorsed at the European Council in June
1998.
European Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of levies
on agricultural imports from non-member
countries, customs duties, the proceeds of
value added tax receipts and contributions
from member states based on gross national
product (GNP).
In March 1999 the European Council
agreed on budgetary amendments. The ‘own
resources’ system for financing the EU will
maintain the current ceiling of 1.27% of
GNP; but, progressively from 2001, more
revenue will be raised from contributions
linked to GNP and less from VAT receipts
and customs payments. It was also agreed that
the UK’s annual budget rebate (in place since
1984, and without which the British net
contribution would be far greater than that
justified by its share of Community GNP)
would remain.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and capital
within the EU, came into effect in 1993 (see also
p. 418). Largely complete in legislative terms, it
covers, among other benefits, the removal of
customs barriers, the liberalisation of capital
movements, the opening of public procurement
markets and the mutual recognition of
professional qualifications.
Measures to improve the operation and
effectiveness of the single market were
approved by the European Council in 1997.
These sought to ensure the removal of
remaining obstacles, with better
implementation and enforcement of existing
rules, and action to simplify single market
legislation. By February 1999 the proportion
of single market Directives not yet
implemented by all member states had fallen
to just under 14% of the total.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which came into force in 1994,
most of the EU single market measures have
been extended to Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein. EEA member states comprise
the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
40% of all global trade.
Transport, Energy and
T elecommunications
The concept of a common transport policy
was laid down in the Treaty of Rome (see also
chapter 22). EU objectives in energy policy are
security of supply, liberalised energy markets
and environmental protection. Most of the
legislation on liberalisation of the
telecommunications market was in force by
1998.
The EU is also working towards the
completion of trans-European networks in
81
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
transport, energy and telecommunications.
The aim is to improve the interconnection and
interoperability of national networks.
Agriculture, Fisheries and the
Environment
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources. See chapter 27 for further
details of these policies, and of the UK’s
support for CAP reform (agreement on which
was reached by EU member states in March
1999).
Environmental considerations are
integrated into all areas of EU policymaking.
See chapter 20 for more information about EU
environmental protection measures.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
The economic and social disparities within the
EU are considerable, and will become more
evident with further enlargement. To address
the problem of regional imbalances there are a
number of Structural Funds designed to:
• promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions;
• regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline;
• combat long-term unemployment and
help young people into the labour
market;
• help workers adapt to industrial changes
and to advances in production systems;
• speed up the adjustment of production,
processing and marketing structures in
agriculture; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed
and young people. The Guidance Section of
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance promotes the
modernisation of the fishing industry. A
Cohesion Fund, set up under the Maastricht
Treaty, provides financial help to reduce
disparities between EU members’ economies.
Other initiatives promote new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries, such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding.
New funding levels for the Structural and
Cohesion Funds in the period 2002-06 (£141
billion) were agreed by the European Council
in March 1999.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
investment projects.
Employment and Social Affairs
The UK accepted the social chapter (a
separate protocol to the Maastricht 4 reaty) at
the European Council in 1997 and agreed to
implement the measures already adopted
under it by the other 14 member states.5 Also
in 1997, EU member states agreed demanding
guidelines to shape their national employment
policies and committed themselves to
producing national action plans to show
progress towards implementation.
A European Employment Pact, aimed at a
substantial reduction of unemployment, was
approved at the European Council in Cologne
in June 1999. The pact, bringing together all
the EU’s employment policy measures,
involves three long-term interlinked
processes, namely:
5 In 1998 the UK implemented EU Directives on working
time and young workers, which provide that employees do
not have to work more than an average of 48 hours a week
without their consent (see chapter 11). The Government
intends to implement other Directives relating to parental
leave and worker consultation in December 1999 and
employment rights of part-time workers in April 2000.

• co-ordination of economic policy and
improved interaction between wage
developments and monetary, budget and
fiscal policy, aimed at preserving non-
inflationary growth;
• greater efficiency of the labour markets
by improving employability,
entrepreneurship, adaptability of
businesses and employees, and equal
opportunities; and
• structural reform and modernisation to
improve innovative capacity and
efficiency of the labour market and the
markets in goods, services and capital.
For details of EU education and youth
programmes see chapter 10 (p. 142).
Research and Development
EU spending on research and development
(R&D) plays an increasingly important role in
enabling Europe to maintain the science and
technology base necessary to remain
competitive in world markets. Research
collaboration among member states is
promoted mainly through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the level of funding. The
Government actively encourages UK
companies and organisations to participate in
collaborative R&D with European partners
(see pp. 434-5).
The Fifth Framework Programme (for the
period 1999-2002) covers information
technology, sustainable development, energy
and environment, international research,
innovation and small and medium-sized
enterprises, improving research potential, and
management of living resources.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The CFSP is intergovernmental and, since
1993, has provided for EU member states to
agree unanimously a common foreign and
security policy. Common policies and/or joint
actions have been agreed on a wide range of
international issues. Recent examples include
punitive measures against Serbia over violence
in Kosovo (see p. 89) and the resumption of
dialogue with Iran.
The Amsterdam Treaty (see p. 80) is
introducing several key changes to make the
policy more effective, including the
appointment of a High Representative to help
with the formulation, preparation and
presentation of CFSP policy decisions, and
the establishment of a Policy Planning and
Early Warning Unit in the Council Secretariat
to sharpen the preparation and focus of
common foreign policy decisions.
There are also new decision-making rules.
The Treaty preserves the principle that all
policy should be decided by unanimity, but
states that decisions implementing common
strategies, which are themselves agreed by
unanimity, will be by qualified majority
voting. A member country may prevent a vote
being taken by qualified majority voting for
‘important and stated reasons of national
policy’. Also, a member state may abstain and
stand aside from an EU decision/action when
its interests are not affected.
The EU continues to look to the Western
European Union (see p. 76) to handle defence
issues under the CFSP. The Amsterdam
Treaty provides for the ‘progressive framing
of a common defence policy’, in which the
WEU would support the EU. The WEU also
provides the EU with access to an operational
military capacity. The Treaty recognises that
NATO provides common defence for the UK
and its allies.
In December 1998 the European Council
called for the preparation of EU common
In late 1998, the UK launched an initiative
to strengthen the EU’s capacity to respond
to crises, on the basis that, if the Union is
to play a coherent and effective political
role, this needs to be underpinned by a
credible European military capability. The
initiative envisages that the EU should
have the capacity for autonomous action,
backed up by appropriate military forces,
the means to decide to use them and a
readiness to do so, in order to respond to
international crises without prejudice to
actions by NATO (which would remain
the foundation of collective security). This
approach was endorsed by the European
Council summit in Cologne in June 1999.
83
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
strategies on Russia, on Ukraine, on the
Mediterranean region and on the western
Balkans. The first such strategy, to strengthen
the strategic partnership between Russia and
the EU, was adopted by the Council in June
1999.
Justice and Home Affairs
The Maastricht Treaty established
intergovernmental arrangements for increased
co-operation among EU states on justice and
home affairs issues. Conventions agreed under
these arrangements have included those on
EUROPOL (see p. 92), extradition and the
protection of EU financial interests.
In 1997 the European Council endorsed an
action plan to fight organised crime and to
increase international police and customs co¬
operation (which is due for full
implementation by the end of 1999). In
addition, EU member states and the candidate
member nations agreed in 1998 to step up
joint action to combat organised crime.
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AND CENTRAL ASIA
European Security
Since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
and the formation of new governments in
Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia,
the European security situation has been
transformed. The UK and its NA10 allies,
together with former Warsaw Pact states, set
up the North Atlantic Co-operation Council
(NACC) in 1990 to foster co-operation and
understanding. In 1994 a NATO summit
meeting invited the non-NATO states in
Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia
to join a Partnership for Peace, which, among
other things, enlists the Partners’ assistance in
peacekeeping operations and guides their
armed forces towards compatibility with those
of NATO countries. Then, in 1997, the Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council was established
to develop closer political and military co¬
operation between NATO countries and
non-members.
The UK played a major role in negotiations
leading to:
• the signature in 1997 of a Founding Act
between NATO member states and
Russia, introducing new mechanisms for
a close and permanent relationship;
• a NATO-Ukraine Charter for a
Distinctive Partnership, also signed in
1997;and
• the accession to NATO, in March 1999,
of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland.
Economic Help
The UK and other Western countries
continue to help deal with the economic
problems following the fall of Communism,
and to promote the development of market
economies. The IMF and World Bank, with
the UK’s active support, provide advice and
finance to nearly all countries in the region,
while the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development channels Western
investment. The EU’s PHARE scheme6 is
primarily devoted to aiding Central European
countries in the process of reform and
development of their infrastructure. Countries
of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia
receive help through a parallel programme
(TACIS),7 which concentrates on financial
services, transport, energy (including nuclear
safety) and public administration reform. The
UK’s Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD) provides insurance cover for
exporters to a number of these countries.
Know How Fund
The Know How Fund is the UK’s
programme of bilateral technical assistance to
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
and Central Asia. It aims to support their
transition to democracy and a market economy
by the flexible provision of British skills in a
range of key sectors, such as finance, energy

and public administration, and by encouraging
UK investment in the region. Since 1990 the
Know How Fund has spent nearly £300
million in the candidate countries.
Association and Co-operation
Agreements
The EU has strengthened relations with
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia by signing Europe
(Association) Agreements with them. The
agreements provide an institutional framework
to support the process of integration, and
anticipate accession of these countries to the
EU when they are able to assume the
obligations of membership (see p. 81).
EU Partnership and Co-operation
Agreements have entered into force with
Russia (in 1997), Ukraine and Moldova (in
1998) , and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan (in
1999) . A Trade and Co-operation Agreement
with Albania and a Co-operation Agreement
with Macedonia are in force. The purpose of
these agreements is to reduce trade barriers,
develop wide-ranging co-operation and
increase political dialogue.
EU plans to develop closer links through
Stabilisation and Association Agreements with
states in south-eastern Europe, providing that
they meet the EU’s conditions, were endorsed
in June 1999.
OTHER REGIONS
Middle East
Peace Process
The UK supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) agreed to mutual
recognition and signed a Declaration of
Principles on interim self-government for the
Palestinians in Israeli-held territories occupied
in 1967. The first stage of the Declaration was
implemented in 1994, when the Palestinians
adopted self-government in the Gaza Strip
and the Jericho area. A peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan was also signed in that year.
The UK has continued to encourage peace
negotiations between Israel, Syria and
Lebanon.
In 1995 Israel and the PLO reached an
agreement providing for a phased Israeli troop
withdrawal from occupied Palestinian areas of
the West Bank and for elections to a new
Palestinian Council with legislative and
executive powers. The UK took part in the
international observation of the Palestinian
elections in 1996 co-ordinated by the EU.
Subsequent progress has been far from
smooth, aggravated by continuing expansion
of Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories and terrorist bomb attacks in Israel.
The UK has sought to complement the peace
efforts of the United States, based on the
conviction that a lasting resolution must both
protect Israel’s security and provide a just
exchange of land for peace. In October 1998 a
further agreement was reached—the Wye
River Memorandum (brokered by the US)—
providing for a phased Israeli redeployment
from the West Bank in parallel with
Palestinian achievement of security objectives.
However, deadlock once again ensued. In
March 1999 the UK and its EU partners
called for a resumption of negotiations on
‘final status’ issues, and reaffirmed the
Palestinian right to self-determination
including the option of statehood. A new
Israeli Prime Minister was elected in May
1999 and the European Council, meeting in
June, welcomed his plans to resume talks with
the Palestinians and Syrians and to address the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon.
The new Israeli Government and the
Palestinians agreed revisions to the Wye River
deal in early September 1999.
British assistance to projects related to the
peace process (covering, for example,
education, social welfare, environmental
concerns, human rights, economy and gender
issues) through all bilateral and multilateral
sources amounts to about £25 million a year.
In November 1998 the Government
announced a bilateral programme of UK
assistance to the Palestinians of £50 million
over three years.
85
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Gulf Conflict
The UK, a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, condemned Iraq’s invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990 and supported all
Council resolutions designed to force Iraqi
withdrawal and restore international legality.
Because of Iraq’s failure to withdraw, its
forces were expelled in February 1991 by an
international coalition led by the United
States, the UK, France and Saudi Arabia,
acting under a UN mandate.
The UN Security Council imposed
sanctions on Iraq in August 1990. In April
1991 the Council formalised the ceasefire in
the Gulf War and stipulated conditions for
Iraqi acceptance, including measures to
prevent the development of weapons of mass
destruction, recognition of the border with
Kuwait and the payment of compensation to
those who suffered as a result of the invasion
of Kuwait. Sanctions remain in force
(although with substantial humanitarian
exemptions) because Iraq has failed to comply
with the relevant Security Council resolutions.
The UK has led efforts to bring relief to the
Iraqi people, principally through the koil-for-
food’ programme (under which Iraq may sell
oil in exchange for food, medicines and other
essential humanitarian supplies).
As part of the agreement ending hostilities,
the Security Council authorised the
establishment of a Special Commission
(UNSCOM) to supervise the elimination of
Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. The UK
has provided considerable support to
UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Authority in the form of personnel,
equipment and information since the first
inspection in 1991.
Continuing failure by the Iraqi regime to
co-operate with UNSCOM, and its
unwillingness to heed repeated warnings, led
to a four-day campaign of air attacks against
strategic targets by the United States and the
UK in December 1998. Since then, Iraqi
forces have persistently tried to shoot down
US and UK planes patrolling ‘no-fly’ zones
over southern and northern Iraq, forcing them
to respond against Iraqi air defences in line
with their rights of self-defence.
The British Government has tabled a draft
UN Security Council resolution, proposing a
new body to address outstanding Iraqi
disarmament issues, as well as further
measures to improve the humanitarian
situation in Iraq and to deal with Iraq’s
continued failure to meet its obligations on
Kuwaiti detainees and stolen property.
Relations with Iran
In May 1999 the UK and Iranian
Governments exchanged ambassadors for the
first time since the Iranian revolution in 1979,
bringing years of dispute to a close.
Mediterranean
The UK and its EU partners are developing,
on the basis of the Barcelona Declaration of
1995, closer links with 11 southern
Mediterranean states (and the Palestinian
Authority) with the aim of establishing a free
trade area by 2010.
Asia-Pacific Region
The UK has well-established relations with
Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, many
South East Asian nations, Australia and New
Zealand, and has defence links with some
countries in the region. British commercial
activity has developed through increased trade
and investment and the setting up of business
councils, joint commissions or industrial co¬
operation agreements. The UK is also taking
advantage of increased opportunities for
English language teaching, co-operation in
science and technology, and educational
exchanges.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process
was inaugurated in 1996. ASEM is intended to
foster closer economic and political ties
between EU countries and Brunei, Cambodia,
China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam. The UK, which
hosted the second ASEM conference in
London in 1998, has played a leading role in
the establishment of the ASEM Trust Fund
and the European Financial Expertise
Network (EFEX); the objective of the fund
and EFEX is to help the Asian ASEM
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
countries find effective ways to recover from
recent serious financial instability in Asia and
help prevent future recurrences.
In May 1998 India and Pakistan conducted
nuclear tests, disregarding the global non¬
proliferation regime (see p. 90) and
undermining regional security. As President
of the EU and G8 at that time, the UK sought
to ensure an effective international response to
the tests, and both South Asian countries have
since indicated their willingness in principle to
adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. Serious bilateral tension surfaced
again from May 1999 over the disputed
territory of Kashmir, prompting the UK and
its G8 partners at their June summit meeting
to call for an immediate end to military
confrontation and a resumption of dialogue.
In 1998 Britain rejoined the South Pacific
Commission, having withdrawn from
membership in 1995. The Commission
provides technical advice and assistance to its
Pacific Island members, with which the UK
has long-standing and Commonwealth ties.
Links with the Pacific are also reinforced by
the Lome Convention (see pp. 420—1).
Hong Kong
In 1997 the UK returned Hong Kong to
Chinese sovereignty under the provisions of
the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which
contains guarantees about Hong Kong’s way
of life until at least 2047. Hong Kong’s return
to China was necessary because of the expiry
of the 99-year lease under which the greater
part of the territory was transferred by China
to Britain under the 1898 Peking Convention.
As set out in the Joint Declaration, Hong
Kong is a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China. Apart from in foreign affairs
and defence, the Hong Kong SAR enjoys a
high degree of autonomy, maintaining its own
government. Its capitalist economy and
freedoms, including its social systems, will
remain intact for at least 50 years from the
date of the handover. The Sino-British
Liaison group will remain in existence until
2000 to discuss matters relating to the
implementation of the Joint Declaration.
The UK is represented in Hong Kong by
the largest British consulate-general in the
world. It will continue to have strong
responsibilities towards Hong Kong and the
3.5 million British passport holders living
there. In addition, Hong Kong is the UK’s
second largest export market in Asia.
The Americas
The Government believes that the close
transatlantic links between the UK, the
United States and Canada remain essential to
guarantee the security and prosperity of
Europe and North America.
The UK and the US co-operate very closely
on nuclear, defence and intelligence matters. As
founding members of NATO, Britain and the
US are deeply involved in Western defence
arrangements and, as permanent members of
the UN Security Council, work closely
together on major international issues. There
are also important economic links. The UK is
the largest foreign investor in the US, where
about 1 million jobs have been created by
British investment worth £82.5 billion—nearly
one-quarter of all overseas investment in the
US. Over 40% of US investment in Europe
comes to the UK, a share far bigger than to any
other European country. In 1998 the EU and
US agreed a formula for resolving differences
over extraterritorial trading sanctions against
Iran and Cuba. They are also pursuing a
programme (through the Transatlantic
Economic Partnership and Action Plan) to
break down barriers to trade across the Atlantic
and to pursue multilateral liberalisation.
Strong links are maintained with Canada,
with which the UK shares membership of the
Commonwealth, NATO and other key
international organisations. In 1997 the Prime
Ministers of Britain and Canada issued a joint
declaration to modernise and broaden the
bilateral relationship. The UK is the second
largest foreign investor in Canada and its third
largest trading partner.
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British
volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. Greater democracy and
freer market economies in the region have
enabled Britain to strengthen its relations with
Latin American governments. The UK is now
one of the largest investors in the region after
87
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
the United States. The first summit of EU,
Latin American and Caribbean heads of state
and government was held in Rio de Janeiro at
the end of June 1999, with the aim of building
a strategic partnership between the two
regions based around a political, economic and
cultural dialogue.
Africa
The objective of British policy towards
Africa is to promote positive change
throughout the continent, by building peace,
prosperity and democracy. T he UK
Government is giving political and practical
support to efforts to prevent or end African
conflicts (for example, in Sierra Leone—see
below); promoting trade, reducing debt and
supporting development for lasting
prosperity; and supporting African
governments, organisations and individuals
espousing the principles of democracy,
accountability, the rule of law and human
rights (for example, promoting democratic
transition in Nigeria).
Since the abolition of apartheid and the
election of an African National Congress
government in 1994, South Africa’s relations
with the UK have broadened into areas
ranging from development assistance to
military advice, and from sporting links to
scientific co-operation. There has also been a
steady flow of state and ministerial visits to
and from South Africa. The UK is South
Africa’s largest single trading partner, and
largest foreign investor. Both countries are
committed to build on this relationship by
promoting the further expansion of bilateral
trade and investment. A trade, development
and co-operation agreement with South
Africa was approved by EU leaders in March
1999, providing for the creation of a free
trade area.
PEACEKEEPING AND CONTAINMENT
The UN is the principal body responsible for
the maintenance of international peace and
security. In mid-1999 there were some 10,000
troops from 73 nations deployed to 17
peacekeeping operations around the world.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
In 1998 the UK was the fifth largest
contributor to the UN’s peacekeeping costs,
meeting 6.2% of the £560 million total. It
deploys peacekeeping troops in Cyprus,
military observers in Georgia, Sierra Leone
and on the Iraq/Kuwait border, and police
officers in Bosnia. A small number of British
military officers have been seconded to the
UN Secretariat’s Department of Peacekeeping
Operations in New York.
Cyprus
The UK has a contingent of about 315 troops
in the UN Force in Cyprus, established in
1964 to help prevent the recurrence of fighting
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since
the hostilities of 1974, when Turkish forces
occupied the northern part of the island, the
Force has been responsible for monitoring the
ceasefire and control of a buffer zone between
the two communities.
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991, UN Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending 10
km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
hostile or potentially hostile actions. The UK,
with the other permanent members of the
Security Council, contributes 11 personnel to
the UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission
(UNIKOM).
Georgia
The UK contributes seven military personnel
to the UN Observer Mission in Georgia,
which was established in 1993. Its mandate
includes monitoring a ceasefire between
Georgian government troops and rebels in the
Georgian region of Abkhazia.
Sierra Leone
Nine British military observers are deployed
to the UN observer mission in Sierra Leone
(UNOMSIL). Its role is to monitor and
report on the security situation and on
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Crisis in Kosovo
From early 1998 there was increasing
international concern over the deteriorating
situation in the province of Kosovo in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY—
comprising Serbia and Montenegro) and its
implications for regional stability in south¬
eastern Europe. Excessive repression by
Serbian security forces against the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population,
and terrorism by elements of the Kosovar
population, prompted widespread
condemnation and calls for a peaceful
solution based on the territorial integrity of
the FRY and autonomy for Kosovo. The
UN Security Council adopted an arms
embargo against the FRY, and the EU
imposed economic sanctions in response to
the repression in Kosovo. In September
1998 the UN Security Council adopted a
resolution demanding a ceasefire and the
start of real dialogue to secure long-term
peace and stability. The UK and its NATO
partners threatened to intervene militarily if
the Serbian offensive in Kosovo was not
stopped.
In October 1998 a ceasefire was agreed
which enabled thousands of Kosovar
refugees to find shelter, averting a
humanitarian crisis over the winter. A
verification mission was deployed under the
auspices of the OSCE. However, violence
continued and the situation worsened
significantly in January 1999. A peace
conference, held in Paris, broke up in mid-
March with the refusal of the Yugoslav
delegation to accept a peaceful settlement.
On 24 March the UK and other NATO
countries began intensive air operations
against targets in the FRY in pursuit of a
resolution to the Kosovo crisis and to try to
prevent an imminent humanitarian
catastrophe.
On 3 June 1999 the Yugoslav Parliament
and Government (under President Slobodan
Milosevic, who has been indicted for war
crimes) finally accepted peace terms
presented by special EU and Russian
envoys. These entailed a verifiable
withdrawal of Serbian security forces from
Kosovo and deployment of an international
security presence (with NATO participation
at its core), enabling the return of displaced
persons and refugees to their homes in what
would become a substantially autonomous
province.
NATO and Serbian military commanders
reached agreement on the implementation of
the Serbian withdrawal on 9 June and the
UK and its G8 partners agreed a resolution
to put to the UN Security Council on the
terms for the deployment of the
international mission in Kosovo. With the
subsequent authorisation (on 10 June) of the
UN, NATO and other forces (including
around 10,000 British troops) began
deploying into Kosovo on 12 June to begin
the task of restoring peace to the province.
As well as military support, the UK is
contributing £90 million in humanitarian
and emergency assistance to alleviate the
consequences of the Kosovo crisis.
progress with disarmament and
demobilisation programmes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The UK supports the establishment of a
peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and is helping to implement
the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. The
Stabilisation Force (SFOR), around 33,000-
strong in mid-1999, comprises troops from
NATO nations and other contributing
countries, including Russia and a number of
other Partnership for Peace members (see
p. 84). The UK contributes about 4,500
troops to SFOR. In addition, 80 UK police
officers are with the UN International Police
Task Force in Bosnia.
The main task of SFOR is to ensure
continuing compliance with the military
aspects of the Dayton Agreement, including
monitoring the actions of the armed forces and
inspecting weapon sites. It also provides broad
support to the main organisations responsible
for the civil aspects of the Agreement,
including the Office of the High
89
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Representative, the International Police Task
Force, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees and the OSCE. Although the
Dayton military requirements have largely
been met, some of the civil aspects have yet to
be fully implemented.
The UK is assisting the International
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which was
set up to try those indicted for war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. With other SFOR
contributors, British forces have detained
several of those indicted. Although
governments in the region are responsible for
arresting suspects and handing them over to
the Tribunal, in most cases they have failed to
do so. As well as supporting the Tribunal
through the provision of staff, information and
forensic science expertise, the UK has
provided funds to establish a second
courtroom in The Hague.
The UK has provided over £400 million in
humanitarian and reconstruction aid
(bilaterally and through the EU) to Bosnia
since 1992.
ARMS CONTROL
Because of the global reach of modern
weapons, the UK has a clear national interest
in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and promoting international
control.
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the 1968 Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The UK took an
active part in securing its indefinite extension
in 1995. It also played an important role in
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which it signed in 1996 and
ratified in 1998. The CTBT, with its
permanent verification system, will come into
force when it has been ratified by 44 named
states. The British Government is pressing for
negotiation of a treaty banning future
production of fissile material for use in nuclear
weapons.
While large nuclear arsenals and risks of
proliferation remain, the Government
considers that the UK’s minimum nuclear
deterrent (see p. 102) remains a necessary and
continuing element of British security.
Biological Weapons
The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
provides for a worldwide ban on such
weapons, but there is no effective verification
mechanism. The UK has taken a leading role
in international negotiations to strengthen the
Convention with a Protocol containing
measures to verify compliance, including
mandatory declarations of key facilities and
challenge inspections.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which came into force in 1997, provides for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons is responsible for verification.
During the negotiations the UK made major
contributions to drawing up extensive and
effective verification provisions. All the
necessary British legislation is in place to
license the production, possession and use of
the most toxic chemicals and to implement the
Convention’s trade controls.
Conventional Armed Forces
The UK and its NATO partners have reached
a number of agreements whose purpose is to
enhance security and stability in Europe. The
UK is working with its allies and other
European countries to develop and improve
these agreements in the light of the changing
security environment.
The main agreements are:
• the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty, which limits the
numbers of heavy weapons in the
countries of NATO and the former
Warsaw Pact, and includes a verification
regime. The CFE Treaty is widely
regarded as a linchpin of European
90
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
security; over 50,000 heavy weapons have
been destroyed under the Treaty by its
signatories;
• the Vienna Document, developed under
the auspices of the OSCE, which is a
politically binding agreement by 54 states
on the promotion of stability and
openness on military matters in Europe;
it contains a wide range of confidence-
and security-building measures, and
verification arrangements; and
• the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which
provides for the overflight and
photography of the entire territory of the
27 participating states to monitor their
military capabilities and activities. The
Treaty, which is being provisionally
applied, requires ratification by Russia
and Ukraine for entry into force.
The UN Register of Conventional Arms,
which came into effect in 1992, is intended to
allow greater transparency in international
transfers of conventional arms and to help
identify excessive arms build-ups in any one
country or region. The British Government has
pledged to strengthen the Register by
encouraging greater disclosure of information on
arms exports and arms transfers by all countries.
Landmines
The UK signed the Ottawa Convention
banning the use, production, trade, transfer
and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines in
1997. The Convention, which Britain ratified
in 1998, entered into force on 1 March 1999
and sets a deadline to destroy stocks of such
mines within four years from that date. The
UK will have destroyed all its stocks
(excepting those to be used for training
purposes) by the end of 1999.
The UK has a programme to support
humanitarian demining activities, which is
focused on helping affected countries develop the
capacity to clear landmines and improving the co¬
ordination of international demining resources.
Export Controls
The UK plays a leading role in all of the
international control regimes which govern the
export of conventional arms, technology
associated with weapons of mass destruction and
‘dual-use’ goods (those having a legitimate civil
use as well as a potential military application).
In 1997 the British Government issued new
criteria for assessing licence applications for
arms exports, one of the provisions of which is
that licences will not be granted if there is a
clearly identifiable risk that weapons might be
used for internal repression or international
aggression. At the same time it banned the
export of certain equipment for which there is
clear evidence that it has been used for torture
or other abuses; it also declared its
commitment to preventing British companies
from manufacturing, selling or procuring such
equipment and to pressing for a global ban.
In 1998 the EU adopted a new code of
conduct setting high common standards for
arms export licensing in all EU countries.
The UK Government issues an annual
report (since 1998) on strategic export
controls. The report explains UK policy on
arms exports and gives details of physical
exports and of what equipment has been
licensed for export.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The UK Government has stated its
commitment to working for improvements in
human rights standards across the world and,
in 1999, published its second annual human
rights report describing the activities and
initiatives pursued during the previous year.
The £5 million Human Rights Project Fund,
launched in 1998, has supported almost 300
projects worldwide (for example, judicial and
legal training in Brazil and China). The UK
has also supported the establishment of a
strong International Criminal Court to try
cases of genocide, crimes against humanity
and war crimes. The Government signed the
Court’s Statute in November 1998 and hopes
to be among the first 60 states to ratify it.
International Conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter. Expressions
91
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
of concern about human rights do not,
therefore, constitute interference in the
internal affairs of another state.
The UK Government promotes the
standards set out in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly adopted two international covenants
on human rights in 1966, placing legal
obligations on those states ratifying or acceding
to them. The covenants came into force in
1976, the UK ratifying both in the same year.
One covenant deals with economic, social and
cultural rights and the other with civil and
political rights. States which are parties to the
covenants undertake to submit periodic reports
detailing compliance with their terms. Each
covenant has a treaty-monitoring body which
examines these reports. The UK recognises the
competence of these bodies to receive and
consider state-to-state complaints. Other
international instruments to which the UK is a
party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• the prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
The UK is also bound by the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
which covers areas such as:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression, including
freedom of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (in Warsaw)
promotes participating states’ adherence to
commitments on human rights, democracy
and the rule of law, and takes a lead in
monitoring elections. The Office shares
information and provides a forum for expert
exchanges on the building of democratic
institutions and the holding of elections in
participating states. It also provides expertise
and training on constitutional and legal
matters, and promotes practical measures to
strengthen civil administration.
CRIME AND TERRORISM
The UK plays a major role in international
efforts to combat illegal drugs, working with
producer and transit countries, especially
those where drug production and trafficking
represent a direct threat to the UK. Over 50
drug liaison officers are stationed in UK
missions in key countries, in co-operation with
the host authorities. Working with its EU
partners, the UK is helping Latin American,
Caribbean and Central Asian states to stem the
transit of drugs across their territories. The
UK is also actively involved in the United
Nations drug control structure, and is one of
the largest contributors to the UN
International Drug Control Programme.
Britain had a co-ordinating role on behalf of
the EU at the UN General Assembly’s Special
Session on Drugs in 1998, where declarations
were adopted on reducing the supply of, and
demand for, drugs; money laundering; and
alternative agricultural development.
The UK and its EU partners are tackling
serious and organised international crime
through, for example, the establishment of the
European Police Office (EUROPOL) to
support investigations and operations
conducted by national law enforcement
92
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
agencies. EUROPOL powers and duties are
set out in the EUROPOL Convention, which
entered into force in October 1998. EU
member states also belong to the International
Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).
British liaison with INTERPOL is provided
by the National Criminal Intelligence Service
(see p. 217).
The UK Government has stressed its
condemnation of all terrorist acts, its
opposition to concessions to terrorist demands
and its commitment to ensuring that terrorists
do not benefit from their acts. It works
bilaterally with other like-minded
governments, and multilaterally through the
UN, EU and G8, to promote closer
international co-ordination against terrorism.
The UK is party to 11 international counter¬
terrorism conventions agreed between 1963
and 1991, and in 1998 was one of the first
countries to sign the UN Convention on the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. It is
taking an active part in the UN on two new
international counter-terrorism conventions
on terrorist financing and acts of nuclear
terrorism.
The UK contributes to international efforts
to counter financial crime, for example
through its membership of the Financial
Action Task Force against money laundering.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The Department for International
Development (DFID) is the UK government
department responsible for promoting
development and the reduction of poverty
internationally. The UK Government is
committed to the internationally agreed target
to halve the proportion of people living in
extreme poverty by 2015, together with
associated targets including basic healthcare
provision and universal access to primary
education by the same date. UK expenditure
on development assistance is being increased
from £2.06 billion in 1997-98 to £3 04 billion
in 2001-02.
Most of DFID’s assistance is concentrated
in the poorest countries in Asia and sub-
Saharan Africa, which will receive 76% of
country allocations in 2001-02. DFID also
works in middle-income countries and in the
transition countries (former communist states)
in Central and Eastern Europe to try to ensure
that the widest number of people benefit from
the process of change.
Partnerships
The British Government aims to work in
partnership with poorer countries which
themselves have a commitment, and credible
plans, to eliminate their poverty. As well as
working with governments, DFID is
promoting co-operation with local and private
sector interests. Legislation is paving the way
for the creation of a Public-Private
Partnership (see p. 403) in the
Commonwealth Development Corporation—
the Government’s main instrument for
investing in developing countries—to enable it
to mobilise more resources for development.
DFID is also seeking a more effective
relationship with the international institutions
through which around 50% of the
development programme is spent.
A key element of the UK approach is a
commitment to seek greater coherence on all
aspects of government policy affecting
developing countries. Policies on issues such
as trade, investment and agriculture need to
take account of the needs of poor countries
and contribute to agreed sustainable
development objectives.
Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods
The UK works to promote sound economic
management, including well-founded
monetary and fiscal policies, in poorer
countries. The Government believes that
good policies support the strong, broad-
based, economic growth which is necessary
for poverty reduction. Emphasis is
increasingly placed on development assistance
at the sector level—for example, in health,
education and agriculture. UK support is
often targeted at the promotion of
employment and small enterprise,
restructuring of public expenditure and
taxation, and the reversal of environmental
degradation. DFID has recently provided
such assistance in Ghana, South Africa,
Bangladesh and Uganda.
93
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
DFID believes that effective government
regulation is essential to ensure markets
deliver benefits to poor people. It promotes
regulation of utilities and financial markets to
ensure fair competition and to prevent
exploitation of market power. Well-regulated
banks, credit co-operatives and stock markets
boost domestic savings and promote private
sector investment. The UK has taken a lead in
improving financial regulation in Asia where
instability has led to increased poverty in some
areas.
Land tenure arrangements can be a
significant determinant of poverty. The UK is
encouraging land reform in, for example,
India, South Africa and Eastern Europe. It is
aiming to improve access to credit and savings;
training in business or vocational skills;
appropriate technologies; and market
information. DFID is investing in basic
infrastructure to improve access to markets,
for example in rural transport in Nepal.
Good Governance
DFID believes that the quality of governance
determines whether poor people achieve their
rights and receive basic services. In the past
most of its efforts went into improving the
efficiency of government through civil service
and revenue reform, policing, local
government and public enterprise
privatisation. DFID now intends to address
wider issues. Its new approach will cover a
number of strands—democratic
accountability, fundamental freedoms,
tackling corruption, and access to public
services and to justice—which, when brought
together, should lead to governance which is
representative of, and accountable to, all the
people and effective in realising their rights.
Tackling Debt
The UK Government has called for greater
efforts by the international community to
remove the debt burdens of the poorest, most
heavily indebted countries which are committed
to eliminating poverty. These calls have been
reinforced by the international campaign, led by
British agencies and the churches, for the
cancellation of unpayable debt.
The UK Government pressed successfully
for a comprehensive review of the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative to be
carried out in 1999, and in March 1999 called
for faster and wider debt relief so that HIPC
countries have a permanent way out of their
debt problems. The G8 summit in Cologne in
June 1999 endorsed this call and proposed
changes to the HIPC framework. If approved,
the proposed revisions to the HIPC initiative
will mean that debt relief is delivered more
widely and more quickly. The UK Government
has also emphasised that the purpose of debt
relief is to enable countries to tackle poverty
more effectively; it therefore supports the G8
statement that the central objective of debt relief
is to release resources for investment in
programmes to reduce poverty.
Conflict Prevention and Resolution
Violent conflict disrupts lives and livelihoods,
destroys societies and economies, and reduces
people’s access to basic services. DFID aims
to reduce conflict by building the political and
social means to enable the resolution of
disputes without recourse to violence. This
includes promoting economic growth to
benefit all sections of society, and ethical trade
and investment conditions which are fair to all
countries.
DFID also undertakes targeted measures
such as addressing small arms proliferation,
strengthening international mechanisms for
conflict reduction, protecting human rights in
conflict situations and supporting post-
conflict reconciliation, and working closely
with the UN system and in the EU.
Removing Gender Discrimination
Addressing gender inequalities, and
supporting specific initiatives for women’s
advancement, are key elements of UK
development policies and programmes. With
an estimated 70% of the world’s poor being
made up of women and girls, greater gender
equality is a precondition for the elimination
of poverty. A concern for issues of gender
equality is incorporated into DFID activities
wherever and whenever this is feasible. In
1998-99, about 43% of new bilateral
commitments across all sectors (worth almost
94
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
£568 million) had gender equality as either a
principal or significant objective.
Health
Better health for poor people is a critical
component of DFID’s overall strategy to
reduce by half the numbers in absolute
poverty by 2015. DFID proposes to work with
others to develop effective international and
national policies and systems that promote and
safeguard the health of poor people. Priority is
being given to supporting:
• strong efficient and effective health
systems;
• public health programmes and services
which safeguard the right to health:
• a more effective global response to
HIV/AIDS;
• a healthier and safer physical and social
environment;
• greater utilisation of clean water and
sanitation; and
• social sector policies that will affect
positively health and fertility.
Education
Helping countries to provide primary
education for all their children by 2015
represents a major challenge. Current
estimates are that 150 million children do not
go to school and many drop out before
attaining useful levels of basic education.
Almost 900 million adults are illiterate, two-
thirds of them women. DFID is working with
governments to widen access to school for
girls and boys, to improve the quality of
education offered, and to keep children in
school for the whole primary cycle.
Education plays an essential part in helping
people to develop their skills and escape from
poverty. In recognition of this, DFID has
recently made substantial commitments to the
development of education in a number of
countries, including £67 million in Uganda,
£51 million in Ghana and £34 million in
Bangladesh.
Emergency and Humanitarian Needs
The UK’s objectives in helping to deal with
disasters are not only to save lives, through the
provision of financial, material and technical
assistance, but also to rebuild communities
and livelihoods, and make countries less
vulnerable to future hazards. DFID provides
humanitarian assistance through governments,
UN agencies, the Red Cross, non¬
governmental organisations and, when
necessary, through direct service delivery.
In the last year DFID has responded to a
large number of natural disasters including
hurricanes in the Caribbean and Central
America, floods in Bangladesh and China and,
most recently, a severe earthquake in Turkey.
Substantial humanitarian assistance has also
been provided following more complex crises
such as in Kosovo (see p. 89) and Sudan.
Environment
The UK Government believes that poverty
elimination can only be achieved through
sustainable development, requiring action at
local, national, regional and global levels. The
UK promotes sustainable livelihoods by
community-based approaches to the better
management of common property resources,
such as forests, grazing land and fresh water.
It also aims to improve the access of poor
people to energy, water, transport and shelter
through infrastructure development and the
encouragement of private sector investment.
At a national level the UK is helping
countries develop their own national strategies
for sustainable development and meet their
commitments under the multilateral
environmental agreements for climate change,
biodiversity, desertification and depletion of
the ozone layer.
The Government believes that richer
countries should lead in addressing global
environmental problems. It also believes that
nations and businesses should act responsibly
in the handling of new technologies such as
genetically modified organisms.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF)
and the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal
Protocol (MFMP—see p. 338) support
developing countries and countries with
95
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
economies in transition to meet the additional
costs of multilateral environmental
agreements. In 1998 the GEF was replenished
by US$2.75 billion. The MFMP will be
replenished in 2000. Since their inception, the
UK has contributed £215 million to the GEF
and £70 million to the MFMP.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of foreign policy. It is headed by
the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,
who is responsible for the work of the FCO
and the Diplomatic Service (see p. 61).
Diplomatic and consular relations are
maintained with 184 countries, and the UK
has 220 diplomatic posts worldwide. British
diplomatic missions also employ some 7,800
locally engaged staff. Staff overseas deal with
political, commercial and economic work;
entry clearance to the UK and consular work;
aid administration; and information and other
activities, such as culture, science and
technology.
The FCO’s executive agency, Wilton Park
International Conference Centre in West
Sussex, contributes to the solution of
international problems by organising
conferences in the UK, attended by
politicians, business people, academics and
other professionals from all over the world.
An important function of the FCO is to
promote understanding of British foreign
policies and to project an up-to-date image of
the UK worldwide, beyond the reaches of
government-to-government diplomacy. Key
elements of FCO-funded public
communication work include:
• publications, television and radio
programmes, the FCO website (see
Further Reading), British Satellite News
(used regularly by almost 190 television
stations worldwide to supplement their
news coverage) and various other
information initiatives;
• scholarship schemes for overseas
students (see p. 143) and programmes for
influential foreign visitors;
• the BBC World Service (see p. 275); and
• the British Council (see below).
Other Departrrents
Several other government departments are
closely involved with foreign policy issues. The
Department for International Development
administers the UK’s development aid
programmes. The Ministry of Defence
maintains military liaison with the UK’s NATO
and other allies. The Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) has an important influence on
international trade policy and commercial
relations with other countries, including EU
member states. The FCO and DTI work
together on export and investment promotion
initiatives that focus on the needs of British
industry (although the Government has
accepted the recommendation of a recent review
that trade promotion and development activities
of the two departments should be unified in a
new joint operation—see p. 423). HM Treasury
is involved in British international economic
policy and is responsible for the UK’s relations
with the World Bank and other international
financial institutions. British EU policy is co¬
ordinated through the Cabinet Office European
Secretariat.
BRITISH COUNCIL
The British Council is the UK’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas. Its
purpose is to promote a wider knowledge of
the UK and the English language and to
encourage cultural, scientific, technological
and educational co-operation between the UK
and other countries. Its work also supports the
FCO’s objective of increasing respect and
goodwill for the UK. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in the UK;
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
96
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• provides library and information services;
• promotes scientific and technical
training, research collaboration and
exchanges; and
• encourages appreciation of British arts
and literature.
The Council works in 254 towns and cities
in 110 countries. It runs 225 libraries and
information centres which have about
370,000 members borrowing over 9 million
books, videos and tapes each year. Each year
the Council organises over 400 science
seminars and 2,000 exchanges of researchers,
and administers over 560,000 British
professional and academic examinations. In
addition, it manages or supports 3,000 events
each year with its international partners in
the fields of the performing arts, film and
television, visual arts, literature and design.
The Council is financed partly by a grant
from the FCO and partly by income from
revenue-earning activities, such as English
language teaching, the administration of
examinations, and bilateral and international
aid contract work. The training and
education programmes organised by the
Council as part of the British aid programme
receive funding from DFID.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries.
The British aid programme has helped
fund certain Council programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The Council’s Central Bureau for Educational
Visits and Exchanges focuses on education for
international understanding through
partnerships between educational
establishments, curriculum-related exchange
programmes, and workshops and conferences
related to professional international
experience. Information is also provided on
work, study and travel opportunities
worldwide. The Bureau is government-funded
and is the national agency in the UK for many
EU education and training programmes.

Britain’s defence policy supports its wider foreign and security policy, which is
to maintain the country’s freedom and territorial integrity, and that of its
Overseas Territories, as well as its ability to pursue its legitimate interests at
home and abroad. As a member of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation), the UK makes a significant contribution to efforts to maintain
stability throughout Europe.
STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW
In 1998 the Government published a
comprehensive Strategic Defence Review,
which reassessed the UK’s security interests
and defence needs, and considered how the
roles, missions and capabilities of the armed
forces should be adjusted to meet the new
strategic realities. The Review concluded that
there was no immediate or direct military
threat to the UK or its Overseas Territories,
but that the end of the Cold War had
introduced instability and uncertainty in
Europe. There remained the potential threat
of the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, terrorism, organised crime
and the break-up of existing states with
attendant ethnic and religious conflict. In the
new security environment, the Review
concluded that Britain needed the capability
to assist in preventing or containing
international crises by rapidly deploying
highly trained and well-equipped forces to
areas where they were required. The Review
therefore set out a range of initiatives to
improve the operational effectiveness of the
armed forces (see p. 102). The Government’s
aim is strong, modern and cost-effective
defence, now and for the longer term.
The planned changes outlined in the
Review are also designed to reinforce the
UK’s continuing commitment to international
peace and security through NATO and the
Western European Union (WEU—see
p. 76), and through other international
organisations such as the United Nations
(UN—see p. 72) and the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE—see p. 76).
Defence Missions
The Review redefined the defence missions
which underpin the UK’s defence planning.
These are:
• peacetime security;
• security of the Overseas Territories;
• defence diplomacy;
98
DEFENCE
• support to wider British interests;
• peace support and humanitarian
operations;
• responding to regional conflicts both
inside and outside the NATO area; and
• responding to strategic attack on NATO.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
The UK is a founder member of NATO,
which celebrated its 50th anniversary in April
1999. UK membership of the organisation is
the cornerstone of British defence policy. The
Alliance embodies the transatlantic
relationship that links North America and
Europe in a unique defence and security
partnership. The number of members was
increased to 19 in March 1999 with the
accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland. Most of the UK’s forces are assigned
to NATO.
Adaptation of NATO
As part of its continuous post-Cold War
evolution, NATO has pursued a number of
initiatives, including:
• the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council, which provides the
framework for co-operation between
NATO and its Partner countries
(including former members of the
Warsaw Pact);
• the continuing development of the
Partnership for Peace initiative, aimed at
enhancing practical military co-operation
between NATO and Partner states; and
• historic agreements with Russia and
Ukraine, and continuing dialogue with
other countries wishing to join the
Alliance.
NATO is also undergoing a period of
internal adaptation with the ongoing
development of the European Security and
Defence Identity (under which NATO assets
and capabilities could be made available for
\\ EL operations), a major review of the
military command structure, and the
implementation of a Combined Joint Task
Force concept. The Alliance summit in
Washington in April 1999 approved a new
strategic concept for NATO and the launch of
an initiative to improve its defence capabilities
to ensure the effectiveness of future
multinational operations across the full range
of Alliance missions. There was also progress
at the summit on the UK’s initiative to
strengthen Europe’s military capability (see
p. 83).
Kosovo
The refusal of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to sign a peace settlement for the
Kosovo crisis resulted in NATO members
agreeing unanimously in March 1999 to start
air operations over that country to bring the
repression in Kosovo to an end (see p. 89).
Joining forces from 14 other NATO countries,
the UK committed Royal Navy vessels and
RAF (Royal Air Force) support and strike
aircraft; and elements from the Army
deployed in Macedonia and Albania as part of
a Kosovo Peacekeeping Force and to provide
emergency aid to Kosovo Albanians (since a
refugee catastrophe could not be averted). The
air campaign was successful and a peace
agreement is being implemented.
DEFENCE TASKS
The UK and its Overseas Territories
The armed forces are responsible for
safeguarding Britain’s land territory, airspace
and territorial waters. They also provide for
the security and reinforcement, as necessary,
of the Overseas Territories and, when
required, support for the civil authorities in
both the UK and the Overseas Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy aims to ensure the integrity of
British territorial waters and the protection of
British rights and interests in the surrounding
seas. The maintenance of a 24-hour, year-
round presence in British waters is designed to
provide reassurance to merchant ships and
other mariners. The RAF also contributes to
maritime requirements, for instance through
99
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
the Nimrod force, which provides air
surveillance of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
Army units committed to the defence of the
UK, its Overseas Territories and the
Sovereign Bases in Cyprus include 21 Regular
Infantry battalions and seven Home Service
battalions. Among their tasks are military
support to the machinery of government in
war, military aid to the civil power throughout
the UK and its Overseas Territories,
maintaining the security of the Overseas
Territories, and contributing to the security of
national and NATO nuclear forces.
Air Defence
Air defence of the UK and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Air Surveillance and Control System
(ASACS)—formerly the United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment—
supplemented by the NATO Airborne Early
Warning Force, to which the RAF contributes
six E-3D aircraft. The RAF also provides five
squadrons of all-weather Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron.
Royal Navy air defence destroyers can be also
linked to the ASACS, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles
defend the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft
also contribute to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
The UK maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, the Falkland
Islands and Brunei. Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the western Mediterranean, while
Cyprus provides strategic communications
facilities as well as a base for operations in the
eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The
garrison on the Falkland Islands is a tangible
demonstration of the Government’s
commitment to uphold the right of the
islanders to determine their own future (see
p. 77). The garrison in Brunei is maintained at
the request of the Brunei Government. In
addition, a jungle training support unit is
maintained in Belize.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in
maintaining law and order and countering
terrorism. Up to 18 major units are assigned to
Northern Ireland, including six Home Service
battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment. The
number of units deployed to the Province at
any one time is dependent on the prevailing
security situation. The Royal Navy patrols
territorial waters around Northern Ireland and
its inland waterways in order to deter and
intercept the movement of terrorist weapons.
The Royal Marines provide troops to meet
Navy and Army commitments, while the RAF
provides elements of the RAF Regiment and
Chinook, Wessex and Puma helicopters.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
• military assistance to civil ministries, for
example in maintaining the essentials of
life in the community, providing fishery
protection duties and helping in the fight
against drugs;
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies; and
• military search and rescue.
Britain and its Allies
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO and are available for WEU and
peacekeeping operations. Permanent
contributions are made to NAT O’s Immediate
Reaction and Rapid Reaction Forces in the
Atlantic, the English Channel and the
Mediterranean. The UK also contributes to
NATO’s Maritime Augmentation Forces,
which are held at the lowest state of readiness
100
DEFENCE
and in peacetime comprise ships mainly in
routine refit or maintenance.
The main components of the Fleet available
to NATO are:
• three aircraft carriers operating Sea
Harrier aircraft and Sea King anti¬
submarine helicopters;
• 32 destroyers and frigates, and 22 mine
countermeasure vessels;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
and
• amphibious forces, including two assault
ships and a helicopter carrier.
For information on Britain’s independent
nuclear deterrent see p. 102.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. Capable of deploying up to four
NATO divisions, the ARRC is commanded by
a British general, and some 55,000 British
regular troops are assigned to it, including the
UK’s contribution of some 60% of the
headquarters staff and Corps level combat
support and combat service support units.
Britain also provides two of the ten divisions
available to the Corps—an armoured division
of three armoured brigades stationed in
Germany, and a division of two mechanised
brigades and an airborne brigade based in
Britain. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to one
of the Corps’ two multinational divisions, is
also sited in the UK.
Air Forces
The RAF makes a major contribution to
NATO’s Immediate and Rapid Reaction
Forces. Around 100 aircraft and 40 helicopters
are allocated to them. Tornado F3, Harrier
and Jaguar aircraft, and Rapier surface-to-air
missiles form part of the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe’s Immediate Reaction
Force, while Harrier, Jaguar and Tornado
GR1/4 aircraft provide offensive support and
tactical reconnaissance for the Rapid Reaction
Force. Chinook and Puma helicopters supply
troop airlift facilities for the ARRC or other
deployed land forces. Modified aircraft
provide anti-submarine capabilities for
NATO’s multinational Maritime Reaction
Forces. The RAF provides Nimrod maritime
patrol aircraft, and search and rescue
helicopters.
The three Tornado GR1/4 squadrons
stationed at RAF Bruggen in Germany will be
redeployed to the UK by 2002 when the base
will be closed. A further Tornado squadron
also based at Bruggen was disbanded in early
1999. Two Harrier offensive support
squadrons at another German base, RAF
Laarbruch, were withdrawn to the UK in
early 1999 and that station has closed.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote the UK’s wider
security interests may be undertaken by
British forces unilaterally or multilaterally
under UN, NATO or OSCE auspices.
Contingents are deployed in Cyprus, Georgia,
Bosnia and Croatia, and on the Iraq/Kuwait
border. Over Iraq (see p. 86), Tornado
GRl/4s and Jaguars, supported by VC-lOs,
are policing the no-fly zones to ensure that
Iraq does not resume repression of the civilian
population and that it does not threaten its
neighbours. The Royal Navy is deployed to
the Gulf to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq.
A substantial British contingent is deployed in
Albania and Macedonia to help implement the
agreement on Kosovo (see p. 89).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, for example in the Caribbean,
where the West Indies Guardship and other
Royal Navy ships work closely with the
authorities of the United States, the Overseas
Territories and the Regional Security System
to combat drug trafficking. Although primary
responsibility for this work rests with the local
law enforcement agencies or other government
departments, the armed forces assist where
they can do so without detriment to the
performance of their other military tasks.
British troops remain ready to participate
in operations throughout the world. In the
past three years, British troops have taken part
in UN and multinational forces in evacuation
101
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
or humanitarian relief operations in Rwanda,
Somalia, Angola, Eritrea, the former Zaire,
Sierra Leone and Central America.
About 4,000 overseas students from over
100 countries receive training each year at UK
defence establishments. Military assistance is
also given through the deployment of service
personnel overseas, either on loan or as part of
short-term training teams.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Although the Trident submarine force is
retained as the ultimate guarantee of national
security, the UK and other members of
NATO have radically reduced their reliance
on nuclear weapons. However, nuclear
deterrence still has an important contribution
to make in ensuring against the re-emergence
of major strategic military threats, in
preventing nuclear coercion and in preserving
peace and stability in Europe.
The UK is committed to pressing for
progress in the negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear
weapons (see p. 90). When satisfied that
verified progress has been made towards the
goal of global elimination of nuclear weapons,
the Government will ensure that the British
nuclear weapons are included in the talks.
Against this background, the Government
has undertaken a fundamental re-examination
of all aspects of Britain’s nuclear capability,
and has concluded that fewer than 200
operationally available nuclear warheads are
needed—a reduction of one-third. Trident
submarines will carry only 48 warheads each,
compared with the previous 60 typically
deployed. In addition, only one submarine is
now on patrol at a time; its missiles are not
targeted and it will normally be at several
days’ ‘notice to fire’.
NEW FORCE STRUCTURES AND
CAPABILITIES
To achieve its policy objectives, the UK
requires forces with a high degree of mobility
and effectiveness, at sufficient readiness and
with a clear sense of purpose, for combat
operations, conflict prevention, crisis
management and humanitarian activities.
These forces must be flexible and able to
undertake the full range of military tasks.
Measures to increase a joint-service
approach to defence were outlined in the
Strategic Defence Review, including the
creation of:
• Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, a pool of
deployable forces from all three Services,
able to carry out a range of short-notice
missions from war-fighting to
peacekeeping operations;
• Joint Force 2000, a joint command of
Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft
able to operate from aircraft carriers or
land bases;
• a new joint helicopter command of some
350 battlefield helicopters—Navy
commando helicopters, Army helicopters
(including a new attack helicopter when
it enters service) and RAF support
helicopters;
• a joint Army/RAF ground-based air
defence organisation; and
• a joint centre for the development of
defence doctrine.
These initiatives aim to further improve the
Services’ ability to work together efficiently
and effectively when required, and to deploy
rapidly to potential troublespots and crises.
An effective frontline, however, also needs
effective logistics, support and equipment. As
well as addressing the equipment needs of the
Services (see p. 103), the Review sought to
improve the way they are supported. Such
measures include:
• a Defence Logistics Organisation,
covering all three Services;
• the establishment of a second logistic line
of communication and two Joint Force
Logistic Component Headquarters which
will each be able to provide support to an
operation of the type conducted in Bosnia
and in Kosovo; and
• the restructuring of the management and
organisation of the Defence Medical
Services, and a commitment to spent an
additional £140 million on medical
support to deployed forces over the
period to March 2002.
102
DEFENCE
Royal Navy
The focus for the Navy will continue to move
from large-scale open-ocean warfare to rapid
deployment and offshore operations in
conjunction with the other Services:
• two large aircraft carriers, capable of
operating up to 50 aircraft and
helicopters, will replace the existing three
aircraft carriers;
• an additional four roll-on, roll-off
container ships will strengthen the
amphibious force;
• the number of attack submarines will fall
from 12 to ten, destroyers and frigates
have been reduced from 35 to 32, and
mine countermeasure ships will increase
to 22 rather than 25 as originally planned;
and
• all remaining attack-class submarines will
be able to fire Tomahawk land-attack
missiles.
Army
Among measures aimed at improving
mobility, firepower and the projection of
forces are:
• an increase in the number of the
armoured or mechanised brigades from
five to six through the conversion of the
airborne brigade to a mechanised brigade;
• the creation of a new air assault brigade
(combining two battalions of the
Parachute Regiment), with the new
attack helicopter when it enters into
service;
• the creation of an additional armoured
reconnaissance regiment from an existing
armoured regiment, which will be
brought back from Germany;
• converting the tank regiments from eight
units to six larger ones, each with
significantly more personnel and tanks;
and
• increasing the operational utility of the
Territorial Army (TA—see p. 105).
RAF
The emphasis of the new plans is on the
ability to deploy appropriate types of aircraft
rapidly to crises. Measures include:
• the procurement of new air-to-air, anti¬
armour and air-to-surface missiles for
Tornado and Eurofighter aircraft;
• developing a new collision warning
system for the Tornado GR4;
• improving the capability of the Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft to support both
peacekeeping and war-fighting
operations; and
• modernising the air transport fleet, in the
short term by the acquisition of four
C-17 aircraft or their equivalent to
provide a strategic airlift capability.
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
programme is to be achieved, namely that of
increasing the flexibility and mobility of the
armed forces.
Improvements for the Royal Navy
equipment programme include:
• the introduction of the fourth Trident
submarine and the building of the
Astute-class attack submarines;
• a modernised destroyer and frigate fleet,
including the introduction of a new air
defence destroyer which will deploy an
anti-air missile system developed with
France and Italy;
• the new helicopter carrier, the purchase of
additional roll-on, roll-off container ships
and the building of two amphibious ships
to strengthen the amphibious force; and
• the Merlin anti-submarine helicopter.
The Army front line is being enhanced by:
• the introduction of the Challenger 2
battle tank;
• Westland Apache attack helicopters
equipped with new anti-tank missiles;
103
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• improved Rapier and new Starstreak air
defence missiles;
• new bridging equipment to increase
mobility and flexibility; and
• a range of advanced surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance
equipment.
Improvements for the 1L4F include:
• the Eurofighter from the beginning of the
21st century, to replace Tornado F3 and
Jaguar aircraft;
• the upgrading of the Jaguar and Tornado
aircraft;
• new Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft;
• orders for new air-launched anti-armour
and stand-off missiles; and
• the introduction of EH101 and additional
Chinook support helicopters and the
introduction of Hercules aircraft.
Defence Procurement
Nearly 45% of the defence budget is spent on
military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
When assessing options, particular
consideration is given not just to the initial
costs of a project, but also to those necessary
to support it throughout its service life.
Competition for contracts takes place
wherever possible. Measures to improve the
procuring of defence equipment, identified by
the Strategic Defence Review’s ‘smart
procurement’ initiative, include better early
planning, an improved through-life approach
and joint arrangements with industry. By
April 2000, all defence acquisition projects
will be run on these ‘smart procurement’ lines.
International Procurement Collaboration
International collaboration offers military,
economic and industrial benefits at a time of
rising production costs and reduced defence
budgets. The UK plays an active role in
NATO’s Conference of National Armaments
Directors, which promotes equipment
collaboration between NATO nations, and in
the WEU’s Western European Armaments
Group, which is the main European forum for
the discussion of armaments matters. The UK
is also a founder member of OCCAR, an
armament co-operation organisation formed
with France, Germany and Italy for managing
collaborative procurement activities. Current
collaborative programmes in which the UK
participates include:
• development of the Eurofighter (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands);
• an anti-air missile system (France and
Italy);
• a battlefield radar system (France and
Germany);
• the EH 101 helicopter (Italy);
• a multi-role armoured vehicle (France
and Germany); and
• a request for proposals for a future large
aircraft (Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Turkey).

Commissioned Ranks
Commissions in the armed services, either by
promotion from the ranks or by direct entry
based on educational and other qualifications,
are granted for short, medium and long terms.
All three Services have schemes for school,
university and college sponsorships.

DEFENCE
At the beginning of the 20th century
Britain had a Navy second to none. In
1897 over 165 warships were assembled in
Spithead to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee
of Queen Victoria. This armada included
21 battleships (of a total of 62 battleships
in service or being built), 54 cruisers and
20 torpedo boats, all drawn from home
waters. The Royal Navy had 112,000
officers and seamen.
The British Army totalled 726,000. The
strength of the regular and reserve forces
in Britain was 108,000 and 83,000
respectively; a further 120,000 were
abroad, including 68,000 in India and
33,000 in other garrisons. Over 415,000
were in auxiliary forces.
When the Boer republics of the Orange
Free State and Transvaal in South Africa
declared war on Britain in October 1899,
the number of British troops in the theatre
was no more than 22,000 to defend a
1,000-mile border with the republics.
Following ‘Black Week’ in December
1899, when the British suffered repeated
reverses at the hands of the Boer forces,
Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, with his
Chief of Staff, General Kitchener, took
command; the Army was strengthened
with regulars, militia, yeomanry and
volunteers. At the end of the war in 1902,
well over 400,000 troops were in the field
against the Boers. To support the Army,
over 470,000 horses and 150,000 mules
and donkeys were purchased; more than
1,000 ships were brought into service to
carry troops and animals; and 1.4 million
tons of stores were shipped in.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities. Courses
of higher training for officers, designed to
emphasise the joint approach to the tactical
and operational levels of conflict, are provided
at a Joint Services Command and Staff
College, established in 1997.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks vary
widely in length and terms of service. Subject
to a minimum period, entrants may leave at any
time, giving 18 months’ notice (12 months for
certain engagements). Discharge may also be
granted on compassionate or medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training, non¬
commissioned personnel receive
supplementary specialist training throughout
their careers. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged, and service trade
and technical training leads to nationally
recognised qualifications. New vocational
training and educational initiatives to improve
recruitment and retention were announced in
the Strategic Defence Review. The Army
Foundation College, which opened in 1998,
offers a 42-week course combining military
training and the opportunity to acquire
national qualifications. The course is intended
to attract high-quality recruits who will go on
to fill senior posts in front-line roles.
Reserve Forces
The Reserve Forces serve alongside the
regular forces and are integral to the ability to
expand the Services in times of crises. In
particular, reserves can provide skills and
units not available or required in peacetime.
The reserves include former members of the
regular armed forces liable for service in an
emergency (regular reserve) and volunteer
reserves, recruited directly from the civilian
community—the Royal Naval Reserve, the
Royal Marines Reserve, the TA and the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force.
The main contribution of reserves—both
individuals and formed units—is to support
regular forces in clearly identifiable roles. This
requires their full integration into regular
formations and ready availability for service,
where necessary through selective compulsory
call-out during situations short of a direct
threat to the UK. Reserves should also be able
to serve in peace support operations. Royal
Naval and RAF volunteer reserve numbers
will increase, and, while the strength of the
TA is be reduced from 56,000 to 41,200, it
will train as an integral part of the Regular
Army, using the same equipment.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Equal Opportunities
The Ministry of Defence and the Services are
committed to racial equality programmes and
to the elimination of any form of harassment
or bullying.
Some 73% of posts in the Royal Navy,
70% of posts in the Army and 96% of posts
in the RAF are open to women. The strength
of women in the armed forces was 7.7% in
April 1999. The Services are also aiming to
increase the intake of recruits from the ethnic
minorities from 1% to 5% by March 2002.
ADMINISTRATION
The defence budget for 1999-2000 is £22.3
billion. By 2001-02 defence spending will fall
from 2.7% to 2.4% of gross domestic product.
The current average for NATO European
countries is 2.2%.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence is both a
Department of State and the highest level
military headquarters. The Secretary of State
for Defence is responsible for the formulation
and conduct of defence policy and for the
means with which it is carried out. Three
junior ministers (one for each Service) and
two key officials—the Chief of the Defence
Staff (CDS) and the Permanent Under¬
secretary (PUS) of State—directly support
the Secretary of State in this task.
The CDS is the professional head of the
armed forces and the principal military adviser
to the Secretary of State and the Government.
The three Service Chiefs of Staff report to the
CDS and are responsible for their Service’s
fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale.
The PUS is the Government’s principal
civilian adviser on defence and has primary
responsibility for policy, finance and
administration of the Department. The PUS
is also personally accountable to Parliament
for the expenditure of all public money voted
for defence purposes. Both the CDS and the
PUS are members of the Defence Council, the
highest departmental committee.
A civilian-military central staff support
much of the work of Defence Council
members, which includes formulating defence
policy, resource allocation, defining future
equipment requirements and providing the
strategic direction for military operations.
Day-to-day activities and management of
the armed forces are administered through
operational, personnel and logistics
commands. The acquisition and support of
defence equipment is handled by the Defence
Procurement Agency, headed by the Chief of
Defence Procurement (CDP), and the new
Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO),
formed in April 1999 to bring together the
three separate service logistics into a single
integrated organisation. The DLO is headed
by the Chief of Defence Logistics (CDL). The
CDP is a member of the Defence Council, as
will be the CDL.

The population of the UK is increasing and ageing, and living arrangements,
relationship formations and lifestyles continue to change. The proportion of lone
parent households with dependent children has increased considerably since the
1960s, as has the number of people living alone. There are fewer people marrying,
and divorce rates remain high. As living standards rise and technology continues
to advance, many more people now have access to home computers and the
Internet, satellite and cable television channels, and mobile telephones.
POPULATION PROFILE
The population of the United Kingdom in
mid-1998 was estimated to be 59.2 million (see
p. 2), the third largest in Europe, and the 18th
biggest in the world. The majority of people
(about 84%) lived in England, with Northern
Ireland having the smallest population of the
four countries at 1.7 million (3%). The
population density in England is the highest,
with about 379 inhabitants per square
kilometre.
Since 1961 the population of the UK has
increased by 12%, although the four countries
have experienced different rates of change.
The population of Northern Ireland has
increased by 18% over this period, while for
England and for Wales the increase has been
14% and 11% respectively. The population of
Scotland was actually 1% lower in 1998 than
in 1961. Mid-1996 projections suggest that the
UK’s population will rise to 62.2 million
people in 2021. Since the 19th century there
has also been a trend for people to move away
from congested urban centres into the
suburbs. In general, younger people are more
likely to live in urban areas and older people in
rural areas.
Age and Gender
The UK has an ageing population. The
proportion of the population aged 50 and over
has nearly doubled in the 20th century, from
one in six in 1901 to about one in three in
1998. There has also been a significant
increase in the number of people living into
their eighties and beyond, and projections
indicate that by 2021 there will be 3 million
people aged 80 and over, representing almost
5% of the population. Simultaneously, the
number of people under the age of 16 has been
falling. While about one-quarter of people in
the UK were aged under 16 in 1971, this had
fallen to just over one-fifth in 1997.
Projections indicate that these trends will
continue so that by 2021 there will be more
people aged 65 and over than children aged
under 16 (see chart on p. 108).

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
UK Population by Selected Age-groups
Millions
a 1996 based projections
In 1901 the population of the UK was 38
million. The annual number of deaths was
about the same as today, but the population
has increased to 59 million.
On average around 1 million babies were
born in the UK each year in the early part of
the century, although about one child in
seven did not live to his or her first birthday.
Children were brought up in larger families
than now, but by 1900 the decline in family
size within marriage, which had first become
apparent 30 years earlier, was well
established.
Contraception was widely practised by the
end of the Victorian era, despite protests
from some that it caused spiritual and
physical harm to people and society. The
majority of births occurred within marriage,
Although more boys are born each year than
girls, and men outnumber women in the
younger age groups, in 1997 there were about 1
million more women in the UK than men.
Around the age of 50 the numbers of men and
women are about equal, but above this age
women increasingly outnumber men, and in
and around nine in ten marriages were first
marriages. Divorce was very rare, with an
average of around 1,000 petitions for divorce
filed each year in Great Britain.
The average household in England and
Wales consisted of 4.6 people in 1901, partly
because of higher fertility rates and larger
families, but also because of the presence of
resident domestic servants. Contrary to
popular belief, there never was a time when
‘extended’ families were common in Britain.
Between 1901 and 1911 about 800,000
more people emigrated from the UK than
migrated into it. Many immigrants were
Europeans—especially Irish—seeking work,
while some were refugee Jews, also from
Europe.
1997 there were about three women aged 89 to
every man of the same age. The male mortality
rate is higher than female mortality at most ages.
The size, rate of growth, age and gender
structure of the population are dependent
upon the influence of birth rates, death rates,
and net migration patterns.
108
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Proposals for the next full census of the
population were published in March 1999
in the 2001 Census of Population White
Paper. The Government has proposed new
questions on the general health of people,
the provision of unpaid personal care, and
religious affiliation (see p. 240); and
revised questions on relationships within
the household and ethnic group.
Birth Rates
In 1998 there were about 717,000 live births in
the UK, representing 12.2 live births per
1,000 population. This relatively low birth
rate reflects a preference for smaller families
compared with the past, a trend that began
over 100 years ago. Throughout the 1980s and
1990s the total period fertility rate, which
indicates average family size, has remained
below 2.1, the level needed for long-term
natural replacement of the population.
In 1998 almost 38% of all births occurred
outside marriage in the UK, around five times
the level in 1966. However, a large majority of
these births (about eight in ten) in England
and Wales in 1998 were jointly registered by
both parents, and in most of these cases the
parents were living at the same address. The
proportion of births outside marriage has
consistently been highest for teenagers, and in
1998 about 89% of births to women of this age
in England and Wales were outside wedlock.
Women under the age of 20 are also the age-
group most likely to register their child
without details of the father.
Mortality
Since 1971 life expectancy in the UK has been
increasing by around two years every decade
for men, and around one-and-a-half years for
women. At birth the expectation of life is now
over 74 years for a man and over 79 years for a
woman.
There were about 628,000 deaths in the
UK in 1998, a death rate of just under 11 per
1,000 population. There has been a decline in
mortality rates at most ages during the 20th
century, particularly among children. Rising
standards of living and new developments in
medical technology are among the factors that
have contributed to improvements in
mortality. The infant mortality rate (deaths of
infants under one year old per 1,000 live
births) was 6.3 for boys and 5.0 for girls in
England and Wales in 1998. In general, in all
age-groups death rates are higher for men than
women, and this helps to explain the gender
imbalance among the older population.
The causes of premature death vary by age
and gender. In 1994—96 around three in five
deaths among men aged between 15 and 30 in
England and Wales were due to accidents or
violence. Cancer accounts for a higher
proportion of deaths among women than men
in this age-group. Even so, deaths by external
causes still predominate for younger women,
although the proportion is smaller than for
men. Cancers and circulatory diseases,
including heart attacks and strokes, are the
most common causes of death among older
people. Overall the UK has one of the highest
levels of premature death caused by circulatory
diseases in the European Union (EU).
HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES
The number of households in Great Britain
has risen, from 16.3 million in 1961 to 23.6
million in 1998, at the same time as the
average household size has fallen (see Table
9.1). These changes are linked to the rapid
increase in the number of one-person
households, which now comprise over one-
quarter of all households, double the
proportion in 1961. The proportion of lone
parent households with dependent children
has increased threefold since 1961, while over
the same period there has been a noticeable
decline in the proportion of households
consisting of a couple with dependent
children. There were 58.3 million people
living in private households in the UK in
spring 1998. Just over one in ten people lived
alone, while seven in ten people were in a
household headed by a couple.

Britain aged 16 and over in 1997 were

married, and about 1 in 12 people were
divorced and not remarried. In the same year
there were almost four times as many widows
as widowers, reflecting the tendency for
husbands to be older than their wives, and for
women to live longer than men.
In 1997 there were about 310,000 marriages
in the United Kingdom, one of the lowest
numbers in the 20th century. The increasing
prevalence of cohabitation helps to explain
this decline. Of the marriages that took place
in 1996, about 185,000 were first marriages for
both partners, less than half the number in the
peak year of 1970. A significant proportion of
marriages—about two in five—represent
remarriages for one or both partners, and of
these the majority were between people who
had both been through divorce. There has
been a slight decline in the number of
religious wedding ceremonies since 1981, and
in 1996 they accounted for just under half of
all marriage ceremonies in Great Britain. The
type of ceremony varies according to the type
of marriage. About two in three weddings
where both partners were marrying for the
first time were conducted by a religious
ceremony but for second and subsequent
marriages this was less than a fifth.
Although there has been a long-term rise in
the number of divorces in the United
Kingdom, in recent years the increase appears
to have levelled off, with the number granted
in 1997—161,100—being below the peak of
1993. The divorce rate for both men and
women in England and Wales had fallen to 13
per 1,000 married people in 1997, the lowest
rate since 1990. About seven in ten divorces
were granted to wives, and the most common
reason given by women was the unreasonable
behaviour of their husbands. Divorce rates for
Scotland and Northern Ireland were lower
than the rate in England and Wales.
Cohabitation has become increasingly
common in the last two decades, and people in
their twenties and early thirties are the most
likely to be cohabiting. It is estimated that in
1996 there were nearly 1.6 million cohabiting
couples in England and Wales. Of these,
around two-thirds were single (never
married), and over one-quarter were divorced.
Only about 40% of cohabiting men and 30%
of cohabiting women were aged over 35.
Family Formation
The proportion of teenagers who became
pregnant fell during the 1970s but then rose
again in the 1980s, so that in 1990 there were
69 conceptions per 1,000 women under the
age of 20 in England and Wales. Since then
the teenage conception rate has fallen to just
over 62 conceptions per 1,000 in 1997.1 he
under-age conception rate stood at 8.9
conceptions per 1,000 girls aged 13 to 15 in
1997. Just over half of under-age conceptions
were terminated by a legal abortion in 1997
(see p. 200).
Generally the fertility rate for older women
has increased since 1981, so that women aged
30 to 34 are now more likely to give birth than
110
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
women in the 20 to 24-year-old age-group.
Many women are postponing having children
until their late twenties or thirties, having first
established themselves in a career. The
proportion of women without children has
also been increasing. Whereas only about one
in nine women born in 1942 were still
childless at the age of 45, projections suggest
that nearly one in four women born in 1972
will be childless by the time they are aged 45.
Meanwhile, technological advances have
enabled childless women who wish to conceive
to do so. The total number of in vitro
fertilisation (IVF) treatment cycles has
increased considerably since its introduction
in 1978, and the success rate has also
improved over that time.
In November 1998 the Supporting Families
Green Paper was published, outlining
government proposals for strengthening
family life. The welfare of children is at
the core of policy, and one of the
Government’s stated aims is to ensure that
all families have access to the advice and
support they need. Among proposals to
deliver this is a ,£540 million ‘Sure Start’
programme aimed at giving families with
young children in disadvantaged areas
better access to childcare, healthcare, and
early education opportunities (see p. 127).
MIGRATION
Population movements occur within the UK
as well as internationally. The most mobile
age-group within the UK are young adults in
their twenties, when many young people leave
their parental home to study, work or set up
their own home. Over the past two decades
there has been a movement of people from
north to south, from metropolitan areas to
smaller settlements and rural districts, and
from inner to outer areas of large cities.
International Migration
In 1997 the total inflow of people intending to
stay in the UK for one year or more was
285,000, while the outflow of people leaving to
live abroad was 225,000 (see Table 9.2). These
figures exclude migration to and from the Irish
Republic, and are also likely to exclude people
admitted as visitors who were subsequently
granted an extension of stay for a year or more.
Between 1988 and 1997 net immigration
increased the population by about 300,000.
Immigration into the UK is largely
governed by the Immigration Act 1971 and
the Immigration Rules made under it. The
Rules set out the requirements to be met by
those who are subject to immigration control
and seek entry to, or leave to remain in, the
UK. New Immigration Rules came into effect
in 1994. British citizens and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before January 1983 maintain this right
and are not subject to immigration control.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
With the intention of making the
immigration system fairer for marriage
partners of British citizens or people already
settled in the UK, in 1997 the Government
abolished the ‘primary purpose’ immigration
rule introduced in 1980. Under this, an
overseas national wishing to settle in the UK
with a British citizen or settled spouse could
be refused entry to, or leave to remain in, the
UK if it was considered that the primary
purpose of the marriage was to settle in the
UK. In 1997 the Government also introduced
a concession to help couples who are by law
prohibited from marrying, either because one
of the partners cannot remarry or because they
are of the same sex. Under the new
concession, an applicant may qualify for leave
to enter or remain in the UK provided certain
criteria are met.
In 1998, some 69,800 people were accepted
for settlement, 11,100 more than in 1997.
When analysed by nationality there were
increases in acceptances particularly from
Asia, the Americas and Africa (see Table 9.3).
There was little change in the relative
importance of each geographical area,
however, with the Indian subcontinent and
Africa each accounting for almost one-quarter
of total acceptances in 1998.
Under the Immigration Rules, nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial
entities must obtain a visa before they can
enter the UK. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or settle in the UK.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest or other specified
British diplomatic post in a person’s home
country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in the UK without restriction. Provided
they are working or able to support themselves
financially, EEA nationals have a right to
reside in the UK.
Asylum
The UK has a tradition of granting protection
to those in need, and to this end honours its

obligations under the 1951 United Nations
Convention, and Protocol, relating to the
Status of Refugees. These provide that
refugees lawfully resident should enjoy
treatment at least as favourable as that
accorded to the indigenous population. In
recent years there has been a significant
change in both the numbers and the
motivation of those seeking asylum in the UK,
with many asylum seekers apparently
motivated by economic rather than political
factors. In the late 1980s the total started to
rise dramatically from around 4,000 a year
during 1985-88 to 44,800 in 1991. Following
the introduction of measures in 1991 to deter
multiple and other fraudulent applications,
numbers fell back in 1992 and 1993. However,
applications have increased again, as in many
other Western European countries, and
reached a record 46,000 in 1998. This was the
second largest number in Western Europe,
being exceeded only by Germany.

increase from 10% in 1997, reflecting the
move to deal swiftly with deserving cases. The
main nationalities applying for asylum were
people from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (16%), Somalia (10%), Sri Lanka
(8%), Afghanistan (5%) and Turkey (4%).
The majority of Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia applications are thought to be from
Kosovo, although not all cases have been
separately identified. In spring 1999 the
Government announced that the UK was
willing to admit people from Kosovo whom
the United Nations had classified as being
vulnerable and in need of evacuation together
with their dependants. These people were
admitted on an exceptional basis for 12
months and as such are not included in asylum
statistics. Under these arrangements, just over
4,300 evacuees from Kosovo arrived in the
UK between April and June 1999. Since the
end of the conflict some Kosovars have
returned to their homeland.
Most failed asylum seekers continued to
appeal against their removal from the UK, and
nearly 14,500 appeals were lodged in 1998. Of
the 25,300 who had their asylum appeals heard
before special adjudicators, only 2,350 (9%)
were successful.
The Special Immigration Appeals
Commission, which began work in 1998, deals
with appeals in cases where individuals are
liable for deportation on grounds of national
security. It was set up in response to criticism
by the European Court of Human Rights that
such decisions were not subject to judicial
supervision.
Immigration and Asylum Bill
The Immigration and Asylum Bill, published in
February 1999, will implement key elements of
the Fairer, Faster and Firmer White Paper
published in 1997. Its provisions include:
• modernising the immigration control so
that it can be operated with more
flexibility. This will help to speed
genuine passengers through the control
and target resources on potential abuse;
• introducing measures to tackle clandestine
entry, including strengthening the
carriers’ liability regime and a new civil
penalty to tackle clandestine entry in
lorries and other vehicles;
• introducing a statutory registration
scheme to regulate unscrupulous
immigration advisers;
• creating new arrangements to support
asylum seekers in genuine need,
involving a new national system, separate
from the main benefits system, which
will relieve the current burden on local
authorities. Accommodation will be
provided on a ‘no choice’ basis, with
other support generally being provided in
kind to reduce the incentive to economic
migration; and
• replacing the existing multiple rights of
appeal with a single comprehensive right
of appeal, and enhancing the role of the
Immigration Appeal Tribunal.
NATIONAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS
Citizenship
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with the UK;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (now known as ‘Overseas
Territories’—see p. 77); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in the UK if his or her
mother or, if legitimate, father is a British
citizen or is settled in the UK. A child
adopted in the UK by a British citizen is also a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in the UK is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under an EU institution.
113
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in the UK who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth, or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in the UK, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must in addition
intend to have their main home in the UK or
be employed by the Crown, or by an
international organisation of which the UK is
a member, or by a company or association
established in the UK.
In 1998, 54,000 people were granted British
citizenship in the United Kingdom. Nearly
3,800 applications were refused. Over one in
four of all successful applications were from
citizens of Indian subcontinent countries, with
Africa accounting for almost one in four and
the rest of Asia representing about one in five.
Ethnic Profile
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in the UK, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities. The Irish have long
formed a large section of the population.
Jewish refugees who came to the UK towards
the end of the 19th century and in the 1930s
were followed by other European refugees
after 1945. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and Indian subcontinent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s, while
many people of South Asian descent came to
this country as refugees from Kenya, Malawi
or Uganda in the 1960s and 1970s. In recent
years the majority of people have come from
the Indian subcontinent, the rest of Asia, and
Africa (see Table 9.3).
Analysis of the Labour Force Survey by the
Office for National Statistics has found that in
1997 just under 94% of the population of
Great Britain belonged to the ‘White’ group,
while about 3.6 million people described
themselves as belonging to another ethnic
group (see Table 9.4). The Indian group form
the largest of the non-White ethnic groups,
representing about one in four of the ethnic
minority population. In general, these groups
tend to have a younger age profile than the
White population, and the relatively greater
concentration of the ethnic minority
population in the fertile age-groups may partly
explain the increase in the size of some of
these populations in recent years.
The 1991 Census revealed that members of
ethnic minority groups were heavily
concentrated in the most populous areas of
England, with relatively small numbers in
Scotland and Wales. Over half lived in the
South East of England. The highest
concentration was in the London borough of
Brent, where nearly 45% of the local
population were from non-White groups.
There were also variations in the regional
concentrations of different ethnic groups.
About three-fifths of people from Black ethnic
groups lived in London, compared with about
two-fifths of Indians and just under one-fifth
of Pakistanis. Outside London there were high
concentrations of Indians in Leicester,
Wolverhampton and Slough, and high
concentrations of Pakistanis in Lancashire,
Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the Black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in the UK. For example,

a Population in private households only
young people from some non-White ethnic
groups are leading the way for participation
and achievement in education.
Furthermore, many individuals have
achieved distinction in their careers and in
public life, and the proportion of ethnic
minority members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. There are
at present nine Black and Asian Members of
the House of Commons. In May 1999 Keith
Vaz MP was appointed Under-Secretary of
State in the Lord Chancellor’s Department,
the First Asian Minister in a British
government. Several Asian entrepreneurs are
multi-millionaires.
The Government has a Race Equality Unit
whose responsibilities include race relations
policy and legislation. It also has responsibility
for the reception and resettlement of refugees.
A Race Relations Forum was established in
1998 to advise the Home Secretary on issues
affecting ethnic minority communities. It
gives these communities a channel of
communication with government, and an
input into policy development.
Economic, environmental, educational and
health programmes of central government and
local authorities exist to combat disadvantage.
There are also special allocations which
channel extra resources into projects of
specific benefit to ethnic minorities, including,
for example, the provision of specialist
teachers for children needing English
language tuition. The Government promotes
equal opportunities for ethnic minorities
through training programmes, including
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language.
Cultural and recreational schemes and the
health and personal social services also try to
take account of the particular needs of ethnic
minorities.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976, which applies to
England, Scotland and Wales, and parallel
legislation for Northern Ireland introduced in
1997, make discrimination unlawful on
grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic
or national origin in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment, in
housing, in education and in advertising. The
legislation gives complainants direct access to
civil courts and, for employment complaints,
to employment tribunals. It is a criminal
offence to incite racial hatred under the
provisions of the Public Order Act 1986.
In order to protect ethnic minority
communities from intimidation, the Crime
and Disorder Act 1998 (see p. 214) created
new offences of racial harassment and racially
motivated violence. It also introduced court
orders which prohibit named individuals from
harassing the community, including racially
motivated harassment.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE),
established by the 1976 Act, is a publicly
funded independent organisation working in
both the public and private sectors to provide
advice to the general public in Great Britain
about the Race Relations Act, to tackle racial
discrimination and to encourage racial
equality. It helps individuals with complaints
about racial discrimination; in 1998 about
10,000 people called the CRE for advice on
115
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
such matters, and 1,657 applications were
made for assistance with cases. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important campaigning and educational role,
and has issued codes of practice in
employment, education, healthcare, maternity
services and housing. The CRE can also
undertake or fund research. A Commission for
Racial Equality for Northern Ireland was
established in 1997, with similar powers.
The CRE supports the work of 108 racial
equality councils or similar organisations.
These are autonomous voluntary bodies set up
in most areas to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations at the local
level. The Commission helps to pay the
salaries of officers employed by the racial
equality councils, most of which also receive
funds from their local authorities. It also gives
grants to ethnic minority self-help groups and
to other projects run by, or for the benefit of,
ethnic minority communities.
Language
English is the main language spoken in the
UK, and is also one of the most widely used in
the world. Estimates suggest that 310 million
people speak it as their first language, with a
similar number speaking it as a second
language. It is an official language in a large
number of overseas countries, and is widely
used internationally as the main language for
purposes such as air traffic control,
international maritime communications and
academic gatherings.
Modern English derives primarily from one
of the dialects of Old English (or Anglo-
Saxon), itself made up of several Western
Germanic dialects taken to Britain in the early
5th century. However, it has been very greatly
influenced by other languages, particularly
Latin and, following the Norman conquest, by
French—the language of court, government
and the nobility for many years after 1066.
The re-emergence of English as the standard
language of England was marked by events
such as the Statute of Pleading in 1362, which
laid down that English was to replace French
as the language ol lawr. The 14th century saw7
the first major English literature since Anglo-
Saxon days, with works such as Piers Plowman
by William Langland and the Canterbury Tales
by Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there
remained great regional variations in the
language, and spellings were not always
standardised.
Following the introduction of the printing
press to England by William Caxton in the late
15th century, there was a considerable
flowering of English literature in the 16th and
early 17th centuries. William Shakespeare,
Edmund Spenser and Christopher Marlowe
produced work that is still famous today,
w hile Cranmer’s prayerbook and the
Authorised (‘King James’) Version of the
Bible also date from this period. About this
time, too, translations of Latin, Italian and
other European works into English vastly
expanded the English language. The w ork of
early lexicographers, of whom the most
famous was Samuel Johnson (1709-84), led to
greater standardisation in matters such as
spelling.
Several different languages are spoken in
England in addition to English,1 often
within ethnic minority communities.
Punjabi is the most commonly spoken
South Asian language among British
Asians, followed by Urdu and then Hindi.
Cantonese is the most commonly spoken
language among ethnic Chinese people,
w hile about one in five Caribbeans speak
Patois.
ECONOMIC CHANGES
Marked improvements in the UK’s standard
of living have taken place during the 20th
century. The average annual growth of the
economy as measured by gross domestic
product (GDP) in volume terms was 2.5%
between 1951 and 1997. Within the United
Kingdom GDP per head varies. In England,
for example, it is highest in the regions in the
south and east of the country and lowest in the
1 For the Welsh language see p. 30; for Gaelic see p. 26
and for Irish see p. 20.
116
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
north and west. Between 1996 and 1997 GDP
per head, relative to the UK average, rose in
the South West, the North West, Yorkshire
and the Humber, and Scotland, with little
change in other regions. UK GDP per head in
1997 was around the average for the 15 EU
countries.
Income and Wealth
Real household disposable income per head
nearly doubled between 1971 and 1997. At the
same time the gap between those on high and
low incomes grew, especially during the 1980s,
although the gap stabilised in the 1990s. Lone
parents and pensioners tend to be over¬
represented among those on low incomes. In
1996-97, 42% of lone parent families were in
the bottom fifth of the income distribution.
Wages and salaries remain the main source
of household income for most people,
although the proportion they contribute has
declined, from 61% in 1987 to 56% in 1997.
Occupational pensions have become an
increasingly important source of income for
pensioners while the proportion of income
from benefits has fallen, particularly among
those who have retired recently. The
proportion of recently retired pensioners’
income from occupational pensions increased
in real terms (after allowing for inflation) from
17% in 1981 to 28% in 1996-97.
The tax and benefit system redistributes
income from households on high incomes to
those on lower incomes. Households make
payments through direct and indirect taxes,
and social security contributions, while
benefits are received through both cash
payments and provision of benefits in-kind,
such as the National Health Service.
Households with high incomes tend to pay
more in taxes than they receive in income,
while those on low incomes benefit more than
they are taxed. The average original income of
the top fifth of households is 19 times the
average of the bottom fifth. Taxes and benefits
reduce this inequality so that the ratio for final
income is four to one. The types of household
that tend to be net beneficiaries from the
redistribution of taxes and benefits include
lone parent families, families with three or
more children, and retired households.
Wealth continues to be much more
unequally distributed than income, with the
most wealthy 10% of the population owning
half the total marketable wealth of the
household sector in 1995. The value of net
wealth held by the household sector in the UK
was £3,582 billion in 1997. Investment in life
assurance and pension funds accounted for
36% of this total, compared with 24% in
1987. This reflects a greater uptake of personal
pension arrangements, with more people
making a greater amount of provision, as well
as increases in the prices of equities
(principally securities and bonds) in which
household sector wealth has been invested.
Social Exclusion
Social exclusion is a description of what can
happen when individuals or areas suffer from
a combination of linked problems, such as
unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor
housing, bad health and family breakdown.
The Government has policies for reducing all
of these individually, but government
programmes have been less effective at
tackling the interaction between these
problems or preventing them arising in the
first place. A Social Exclusion Unit was set up
in the Cabinet Office in 1997 to co-ordinate
and improve government action to reduce
social exclusion in England. The Unit works
closely with officials in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. So far the Unit has
produced reports on truancy, rough sleeping,
the most rundown housing estates and teenage
pregnancies.
SOCIAL TRENDS
Eating and Drinking Habits
Since the early 1970s there have been marked
changes in the British diet. One feature has
been the rise in consumption of poultry while
that of red meat (such as beef and veal) has
fallen. Fresh fruit is increasingly popular
while consumption of fresh green vegetables,
including cabbages, peas and beans, was lower
in 1998 than in 1970. In addition, the use of
convenience food—both frozen and ready
meals—has increased. Despite these changes,
117
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the British diet is still noticeably different to
that in other countries such as those in the
Mediterranean, being relatively low in fruit,
vegetables and fish. However, there have been
important changes within these broad types of
food, so that mushrooms and salad vegetables
have superseded traditional vegetables, such as
swedes and parsnips. Whereas in the early
post-war period a typical meal would have
been roast beef, roast potatoes and cabbage in
the middle of the day, today it is more likely to
be microwaved chicken and frozen chips in
the evening.
Features of the pattern of consumption in
1998 compared with 1997 included:
• a stabilisation in consumption of carcass
beef and veal—this had risen by 9% in
1997 following a fall of 17% in 1996
when consumption had been affected by
concern over eating beef; consumption of
boned beef joints rose in 1998 to
compensate for the ban on beef on the
bone introduced in December 1997 (see
P- 452);
• consumption of poultry, pork and fish
showed little change although, in the case
of fish, the increase in recent years in the
consumption of fresh fish was again
evident;
• a 2% fall in consumption of milk and
cream (including yogurts, fromage frais
and other dairy desserts)—the fourth
slight fall in successive years;
• lower purchases of fresh potatoes (down
by 4%) and fresh vegetables (2%) as
prices were significantly higher than in
1997;and
• purchases of fruit juice increased by
10%.
Energy intakes from food continued to
decline—to an average of 1,850 kilocalories
(kcal) in 1998, compared with 1,910 kcal in
1997. Average vitamin intakes were generally
above the daily amounts recommended by the
Department of Health, although intakes of
most essential minerals were slightly under
recommended amounts. Health considerations
appear to have been influencing some aspects
of diet in recent years, for example, in the
long-term fall in red meat sales, and the
growth in low fat spread consumption.
Pubs retain their popularity, with about 80%
of beer being drunk in pubs and clubs, and many
have become popular venues for eating out.
Three-quarters of adults visit a public house at
least once every three months and almost as
many have a meal in a non-fast food restaurant.
Lager is now estimated to account for nearly
60% of all beer sales. Nowadays ‘fast food’

outlets—selling, for example, hamburgers,
pizza, chicken and the traditional fish and
chips—are widespread in the UK’s high streets.
In restaurants one can eat food from many other
countries—Chinese, Indian, Italian and French
are among the most widely available cuisines.
Sandwich bars and coffee shops are common,
especially in towns and cities.
Women and Men
Employment and Income
The economic and domestic lives of women
have changed considerably in the 20th
century. Women are taking an increasingly
important role in the labour market. In 1971,
91% of men of working age, compared with
57% of women, were economically active in
Great Britain. By 1997 women’s activity rates
had increased to 72% of women of working
age, while men’s activity rates slowly declined
in the 1980s and 1990s to 85% in 1997.
Despite the growth in female employment in
recent years, women and men still tend to work
in different industries. The main industry
group for female full-time employees is public
administration, education and health. Although
there has been a long-term decline in
manufacturing industry since the 1970s, about
three in ten full-time working men work in this
sector. Women are under-represented in some
occupations and at senior levels. For example,
even though the proportion of directors who are
female has risen since the mid-1970s, fewer than
5% of directors were women in 1998.
The average individual income of men was
higher than that of women in all age bands in
1996-97, largely because of their higher levels
of earnings, self-employment income and their
longer hours of working. The gap between
male and female earnings has been closing but
the differential remains, with female full-time
employees earning around four-fifths of the
corresponding male hourly rate. The ‘pay gap’
increases with age. In addition, men are more
likely than women to have certain investments
such as pensions.
Public Policy
There are a record 121 women MPs in the
Westminster Parliament, representing 18% of
the total number of seats. This proportion is
close to the EU average of 22%. About two-
fifths of the Members of the Scottish Parliament
and Welsh Assembly are women. Five women
sit in the UK Cabinet, including the Leader of
the House of Lords, who is also the Minister for
Women. She chairs the Cabinet Sub-committee
on Women’s Issues. Support is provided by the
Women’s Unit in the Cabinet Office.
The Government is working to ensure that
the perspective of women is automatically taken
into account in the development of government
policies. It is also seeking to improve
communications with women’s organisations.
Following a review in 1998, action is being taken
to make the advisory Women’s National
Commission more responsive and influential,
and better able to represent the views of women’s
organisations. Its membership is to be increased
by 50% to 75 organisations with a view to
reaching the smaller groups representing women.
The Government is encouraging the
development of ‘family-friendly’ employment
policies and practices. It supports ‘Opportunity
Now’, an employer-led initiative (with around
350 members) to increase the participation of
women in the workforce. Action is being taken
to enable more women to join or re-enter the
labour market and to improve their employment
rights. Measures include making it worth their
while to work through the national minimum
wage (see p. 156), which is expected to benefit
more female than male full-time employees, and
the New Deal for Partners of Unemployed
People (see p. 154), which is intended to help
more lone parents (the vast majority of whom
are women) and partners of unemployed people
to return to work. The Government has issued a
National Childcare Strategy, which aims to
secure a range of affordable and good-quality
childcare for children aged up to 14 in every
neighbourhood. There is also a new Childcare
Tax Credit, within the Working Families Tax
Credit (see p. 178), which will provide help
with childcare costs for parents in work; and a
review' of the pension system to help women
provide for their retirement.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and women
119
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services. Discriminatory job recruitment
advertisements are unlawful. Under the Equal
Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, work which is rated as
equivalent, or work which is of equal value.
Parallel legislation on sex discrimination and
equal pay applies in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has
the duties of working towards the elimination
of sex discrimination and promoting equality
of opportunity. It provides advice to
individuals and supports legal actions against
discriminatory practices. The EOC runs an
‘Equality Exchange’, with around 700
members, which enables employers to
exchange information on good practice.
Further details of the Government’s equal
opportunities policies may be found in chapter
6, p. 61.
Personal Safety
According to the 1998 British Crime Survey,
in 1997 six out of ten incidents of violence in
England and Wales were against men, but
women were more likely to experience
domestic violence than men. Women were the
victims of seven in ten violent domestic
incidents in 1997, and slightly over two in five
(an estimated 582,000) of total violent offences
against women were domestic attacks,
compared with just over one in ten for men.
The Government is developing a programme
of measures to prevent violence against
women wherever possible, and to protect
women and provide justice for them when
violence does occur. This will cover England
and Wales. Separate strategies are being
developed for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Voluntary Sector
Across the UK many thousands of voluntary
organisations exist, ranging from national
bodies to small local groups. Serving the
community through volunteering is a long-
established tradition in the UK. The
voluntary sector employs 485,000 people, has
3 million volunteers, and the economic
contribution of the voluntary sector and
volunteering is estimated to be just under 2%
of GDP. Many volunteers are involved in
work which improves the quality of life in
their local communities, or give their time to
help organise events or groups in areas as
diverse as social welfare, education, sport,
heritage, the environment and the arts. A large
number of older people are involved in a
variety of volunteering activities. Indeed,
while volunteering rates among the whole
population have fallen in the 1990s, an
increasing proportion of older people are
carrying out a variety of volunteering
activities.
The Government greatly values the
voluntary sector’s contribution to society. For
example, voluntary organisations are
important providers of government-supported
employment and training services for
unemployed people. As a result, the
Government is keen to encourage productive
partnerships between the statutory and
voluntary sectors. An Active Community Unit
has been established to encourage voluntary
and community involvement, to raise the
profile of the voluntary sector within
government and across society, and co¬
ordinate the work of government departments
in this area.
In order to provide a general framework for
enhanced relationships between government
and the voluntary sector, ‘Compacts’ have
been drawn up in all four countries of the UK
in consultation with the voluntary sector,
taking account of the distinct traditions of
voluntary activity in each constituent nation.
Monitoring the implementation and progress
of the Compacts within government has been
assigned to a ministerial group. It is intended
to encourage other public bodies and local
government to adopt or adapt Compacts for
use locally.
Charities
The Charity Commission for England and
Wales, a non-ministerial government
department, is responsible for the registration,
120
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
monitoring and support of organisations that
are charitable in law. At the end of 1998 there
were about 188,000 charities registered with
the Commission. A review of the Register of
Charities is currently taking place to ascertain
whether there are any organisations that
currently benefit from charitable status which
most people would not now regard as
charitable, and if there are any bodies not on
the register that might be added. Essential
characteristics of a charity have been outlined
to inform the Review. These define a charity as
being an organisation whose aims are for
exclusively charitable purposes, and thus
providing clear benefit to others in society.
This excludes any organisation whose main aim
is the pursuit of party or other political aims.
The charitable sector is a major part of the
economy. The combined annual income of
organisations registered with the Charity
Commission for England and Wales in 1998
was just under £20 billion. About 70% of
these organisations had a recorded annual
income of under £10,000, with the financial
wealth of registered charities, measured by
annual income, concentrated in a few very
large charities such as the National Trust,
Oxfam, the Salvation Army and Barnardo’s.
The Commission gives advice to trustees of
charities on their administration, and has a
statutory responsibility to ensure that charities
make effective use of their resources. Recent
legislation has strengthened the
Commissioners’ powers to investigate and
supervise charities. These include new
measures to protect charities and donors from
bogus fund-raisers and a new framework for
charity accounts and reports.
Funding
Voluntary organisations may receive income
from several sources, including:
• central and local government grants;
• contributions from individuals,
businesses and trusts;
• earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
• fees from central and local government
for those services which are provided on
a contractual basis.
The introduction of the National Lottery
(see below) has given charities and voluntary
organisations the opportunity to secure
substantial new funding for projects across a
range of activities.
CAP (Charities Aid Foundation) is a
registered charity that works to increase
resources for the voluntary sector in the UK
and overseas. As well as providing services
that are both charitable and financial, CAP
undertakes a comprehensive programme of
research and publishing, and is established as a
leading source of information on all aspects of
the sector.
Another valuable source of revenue for
charities is through tax relief and tax
exemptions. The Gift Aid scheme provides
tax relief on single cash donations of at least
£250. Under the Payroll Giving scheme,
employees can make tax-free donations to
charity from their earnings. In March 1999
Gift Aid 2000 was launched, under which tax
relief is available on donations of £100 or
more given before the end of the year 2000 to
charities working on education or anti-poverty
projects in the world’s 80 poorest countries. In
April 1999 it was announced that the scheme
would be extended to include donations to
charities helping Kosovan refugees.
Since 1996 a global coalition of charitable
and voluntary organisations, referred to as
the Jubilee 2000 Coalition, has been
campaigning for relief of the debt burden
that is borne by many of the world’s
poorest countries. Jubilee 2000 is being
promoted in over 40 countries, including
donor countries such as Germany, the US
and Britain, as well as developing
countries, such as Ghana and Uganda.
National Lottery
National lotteries have existed in Britain
intermittently since 1569. Since the National
Lottery was launched in 1994 most people
have played it and it has become the biggest
lottery in the world. In a recent survey, 71%
of households reported participating in the
Saturday night lottery draw. Those
121
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
households that played both the Saturday and
Wednesday night draws spent an average of
£5.31 a week on the lottery.
Ticket sales fell by 5.6% to £5.2 billion in
1998_99. A new game, Thunderball, was
launched in June 1999, to revitalise lottery
sales. It aims to attract people who want a
better chance of winning a prize, even if the
amount is smaller. Tickets or scratchcards are
available from over 35,000 retail outlets.
Camelot Group pic, a private sector
consortium, has the franchise to run the
Lottery until 2001.
How Each £\ Spent on the
National Lottery is Allocated
Some £1.5 billion had been raised for good
causes by the end of May 1999 and over
38,000 awards for £6.1 billion had been
distributed. By 2001 this is expected to have
reached at least £10.6 billion, around £1.9
billion more than originally forecast. Over half
the awards have been for less than £50,000.
Lottery money was originally shared equally
among five good causes—sport, charities, the
arts, heritage and projects to mark the third
millennium—but the National Lottery Act
1998 provided for a sixth good cause—
education, health and environment projects.
The distribution rules have been changed by
the Government to shift the emphasis from
buildings and capital projects to people.
The Lottery was originally regulated by the
Director General of the National Lottery, who
headed the Office of the National Lottery. It is
now regulated by a five-person National
Lottery Commission. Its duties are to protect
players’ interests, to ensure the Lottery is run
with propriety, and—subject to satisfying
those two criteria—to maximise the amount
raised for good causes. It will also select the
next Lottery operator from October 2001 and
will be able to appoint a not-for-profit
operator if that would provide the best return
for good causes.
Leisure Trends
The most common leisure activities are home-
based, or social, such as visiting relatives or
friends. Television viewing is by far the most
popular leisure pastime, with average viewing
time exceeding 25 hours a week. Nearly all
households have one television set or more,
and about 80% of teenagers have a television
in their bedroom. In recent years there has
been an increase in the number of television
channels available (see pp. 269—70). In
1997-98, 13% of households in the UK
subscribed to satellite television while 7%
subscribed to cable television. Many people
also watch videos, either pre-recorded or self-
recorded. In 1996—97, 82% of households had
a video recorder, double the proportion ten
years earlier.
Listening to music is another popular
activity. Purchases of compact discs (CDs)
have risen very rapidly, although this levelled
off in 1997 at nearly 160 million. The
proportion of households with a CD player
grew from 15% in 1989 to 63% in 1997—98.
Other popular pursuits include reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements, gardening
and going out for a meal, for a drink or to the
cinema. Among adults the most popular daily
newspaper remains The Sun and the most
popular magazine is Sky TV Guide.
Technological Change
People in Britain are continually expanding
their access to, and use of, modern
communication technology for both leisure
and business purposes. Two items of
technology that have become increasingly
common for leisure and business use are
mobile telephones (see p. 380) and computers.
122
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
In 1997-98 a fifth of households in the United
Kingdom owned at least one mobile telephone.
The South East was the region with the
greatest proportion of mobile telephone
owners—three in ten households owned one in
1997—98. The number of households owning
home computers in the UK has also increased
considerably, from just under one in six
households in 1986 to over one in four in
1996-97. Households comprising families with
children were more likely than one-person
households to own a computer.
The ‘information economy’—facilitated
through the rapidly growing use of the
Internet (see p. 377)—is receiving increasing
public policy attention in Britain. In March
1999 the Government announced a £1.7
billion ‘computers for all’ initiative, with a
target of a national network of 1,000 computer
learning centres. Another proposal was to try
to bring more computers into British homes
by enabling employees to borrow computers
from their company as a tax-free benefit.
Holidays
In 1997, 57 million holidays of four nights or
more were taken by British residents, an
increase of 39% since 1971. The number of
holidays taken in Great Britain has been
broadly stable over the last decade while the
number taken abroad has grown. The overall
number of holidays taken abroad in 1997 was
nearly seven times the number in 1971. Spain
remained the most popular holiday destination
in 1997, followed by France. The United
States was the third most popular destination
overall and the most popular non-European
destination. Long-haul holidays are growing
in popularity—the fastest growing holiday
destinations outside Europe are Central and
South America, and the Caribbean.
UK residents made 5 million day trips to
the continent of Europe in 1997, of which
most were to France. About 4.1 million
journeys to the continent in 1997 were
through the Channel Tunnel.

All children in the United Kingdom are required by law to receive full-time
education. After the age of 16, when education is no longer compulsory, young
people have a range of choices. Around 70% stay in education, either at school
or at further education colleges, and may then go on to higher education
institutions. Others go into work, with the remainder being guaranteed a place
on the Government’s training programmes.
Education is the top priority for the Government, which aims to raise
educational standards to levels that compare favourably with the UK’s
international competitors. New measures have been introduced to reduce
infant class sizes, raise standards in schools and local education authorities,
enhance the status and quality of the teaching profession, establish a new
school framework, promote training for young employees, and reform student
support arrangements. The Government is also implementing its plans to
encourage lifelong learning, and will establish a University for Industry in 2000.
Government responsibility for education in
the UK rests with the Department for
Education and Employment (DfEE) in
England, the National Assembly for Wales,
the Scottish Executive and the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland (DENI); the
Scottish Executive Education Department is
responsible for primary and secondary
education in Scotland, while the Scottish
Executive Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
Department has responsibility for lifelong
learning and for further and higher education.
Government helps to set the framework for
the education system and works in partnership
with other central and local bodies to
implement its policies. These are directed
towards the continual raising of educational
standards and fulfilling the potential of each
child in order to:
• promote an efficient and flexible labour
market; and
• support economic growth and improve the
nation’s competitiveness and quality of life.
124
EDUCATION
By the beginning of the 20th century
school attendance was compulsory for
children throughout the country (although
at differing age ranges). Class sizes were
much larger than today (numbering
around 50 pupils on average), truancy rates
were high, and many teachers in schools
were not professionally trained. There was
much emphasis on learning by rote, and
discipline was harsh. A co-ordinated
system of education in England and Wales
was introduced by the Education Act 1902,
under which local government became
responsible for state education and for
helping to finance existing church-run
schools. In Scotland at that time elected
school boards were responsible for the
provision of education for children
between the ages of five and 13(14 from
1901), although they were subsequently to
be replaced by local government
authorities in 1918.
INTRODUCTION
The 1944 Education Act (applicable in
England and Wales) fixed 11 as the age when
children in state-run schools passed from
primary to secondary education; many new
secondary schools were created and the
number of teachers employed doubled over the
next 30 years. Pupils aged 11 were required to
take a test (the ‘11-plus’), which determined
the type of secondary school they attended.
The top 20% of pupils who passed the 11-plus
proceeded to grammar schools; the rest went to
secondary modern or technical schools.
In the 1960s a new system of
comprehensive education, adopted by most
local education authorities (LEAs), switched
the emphasis to mixed ability teaching with
the aim of giving all children equality of
opportunity. The 11-plus was scrapped in
many areas, and all children within the state
school system were taught in comprehensive
schools.
In the 1980s, in order to improve standards
nationally, the Government sought to
establish a more centralised means of
monitoring the education system. In England
and Wales a National Curriculum (see p. 136),
setting out what children were required to
learn in a common group of subjects, was
drawn up. Levels of attainment were set, and a
standardised scale against which to assess
children at ages seven, 11 and 14 was
established, enabling comparisons to be made
between different schools. Publication of the
results of the tests has aimed to give parents,
children and educationalists more information
about how each school is performing.
Approved curriculums and the regular
assessment of pupils are also required in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Further changes included allowing
individual schools to ‘opt out’ of local
authority control. Schools that took this
option were known as grant-maintained (or
self-governing) schools and were given more
autonomy over their budgets.
Present Arrangements
The policy of opting out has been ended by
the present Government. In England and
Wales a new structure of foundation,
community and voluntary schools is being
established (under the provisions of the
School Standards and Framework Act 1998)
from September 1999. The community
category initially accommodates county
schools (those formerly owned and funded by
LEAs), while the foundation category includes
many of the grant-maintained schools. From
September 2000 the voluntary category will
include those schools with a particular
religious ethos. All schools are expected to
choose which category best suits their
circumstances and aspirations. The
arrangements will be phased. There are also
two categories of special school under the new
framework—community special and
foundation special. The legislation aims to
give the education system greater flexibility,
allowing individual schools at a local level the
freedom to develop in their own way; but still
providing, at a national level, a framework for
ensuring the maintenance and improvement of
standards. New codes of practice have been
drawn up, outlining the nature of the
relationship between individual schools, their
governing bodies, LEAs and government. The
125
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
codes recognise that partnership is essential
between the various groups involved in
education, and that, wherever possible,
schools should be freed from unnecessary
bureaucratic interference.
Although all schools in Northern Ireland
must be open to pupils of all religions (as
elsewhere in the UK), most Roman Catholic
students still attend Catholic voluntary-
maintained schools, while most Protestant
students go to state (‘controlled’) or non-
denominational schools. By September 1999
there were 43 fully ‘integrated’ schools (out of
a total of almost 1,140 schools in the Province)
accommodating children from both traditions.
Controlled schools in Northern Ireland are
run by five education and library boards.
The Scottish education system has a
number of distinctive features, including a
separate system of examinations and
differences in the curriculum. Most education
authority schools in Scotland are non-
denominational. However, provision is also
made for denominational schools.
Major changes have also taken place in
higher education. The 1960s saw considerable
expansion in new universities. There was also a
substantial increase in 1992, when polytechnics
and their Scottish equivalents were given their
own degree-awarding powers and were allowed
to take the university title. At the same time,
similar provision was made for higher
education colleges which met certain criteria.
GOVERNMENT POLICY ON
EDUCATION
The Government believes that investment in
education and training is the best way to build
a stable, competitive economy with steady
growth. New reforms and investment in
education aim to:
• ensure National Learning Targets (see
p. 127) are achieved;
• reduce class sizes for five to seven year olds;
• tackle social exclusion;
• increase employability; and
• broaden access to further and higher
education for an extra 800,000 people by
2002.
Expenditure
Under the Comprehensive Spending Review
(see p. 400), an additional £19 billion is being
allocated to expenditure on education in the
UK over the three years from 1999-2000 to
2001-02, representing an average annual
increase in real terms of 5%. This money
supplements the extra funds allocated in the
Budgets of July 1997 and March 1998 for
schools, skills training, childcare and the £3.9
billion for the New Deal (see chapter 11).
Total annual expenditure on education in the
UK runs at around £40 billion each year.
The Government is aiming to increase the
share of gross domestic product (GDP) spent
on education from 4.8% in 1990—91 to 5% by
2001-02. A capital investment programme is
allocating £1.3 billion over five years (an
average of £150 for every pupil in the country)
for modernising schools, including £340
million earmarked for school repairs. It is
planned that total annual capital investment in
schools will more than double between 1997
and 2002. Additional expenditure of £725
million in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 for further
education and £776 million for higher
education will help to expand both sectors.
Research shows that 20% fewer young
people from less well-off households stay
on in post-16 education. From September
1999 a new scheme of Education
Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) is being
piloted, giving a financial incentive to
these young people to remain in education.
Pre-school Education
The Government is keen to see an
improvement in the provision of pre-school
education. Among its current aims are:
• to ensure enough free early education
places, at least part-time, for all four year
olds in England and Wales whose parents
want one; and
• to increase the percentage of three year
olds with free nursery education places in
England from 34% in January 1997 to
66% by 2002.
126
EDUCATION
In Northern Ireland a phased expansion
programme aims to increase the proportion of
children experiencing free pre-school
education from 45% in 1997-98 to 85% by
2001-02.
The Government requires that LEAs in
England and Wales draw up an early years
development and childcare plan,
incorporating information on how good
quality childcare will be made available and
how this will be linked to early education. In
Northern Ireland pre-school development
plans are being drawn up for each education
and library board area and childcare plans will
be developed for each health and social
services board area.
In 1998 the Government announced the
establishment of the ‘Sure Start’ programme
to co-ordinate nursery education, childcare,
family learning and primary healthcare
initiatives for children from birth to the age of
three. The programme has funding of £540
million over three years.
The Government is also introducing, from
October 1999, a Working Families Tax Credit
(applicable throughout the UK—see p. 178),
designed to give parents more money to help
them meet the heavy costs of childcare.
Class Sizes
The DfEE is aiming to ensure that, from
September 1999, fewer than 200,000 children
aged five to seven are in infant classes of over
30 pupils (a reduction of 285,000 from January
1998). By 2001, the target is for no infant class
for those aged five to seven to have more than
30 pupils.
National Learning Targets
In October 1998 the Government announced
new National Learning Targets for England
(relating to the year 2002) including the
following objectives:
• 80% of 11 year olds reaching the expected
standard for their age in literacy;
• 75% of 11 year olds reaching the
expected standard for their age in
numeracy;
• 50% of 16 year olds getting five or more
GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary
Education—see p. 129) at grades A to C
(out of seven possible grades);
• 85% of 19 year olds reaching NVC£
(National Vocational Qualification—see
p. 130) Level 2 or equivalent;
• 60% of 21 year olds to reach NVQ
Level 3 or equivalent;
• 50% of adults with NVQJLevel 3 or
equivalent;
• 28% of adults with NVQ^Level 4 or
equivalent; and
• a 7% reduction in non-learners.
Targets have also been set for large and small
organisations to gain Investors in People (liP)
accreditation (see p. 153).
In Wales similar but distinctive targets have
been set for 2002.
Literacy and Numeracy
The Government is committed to tackling
illiteracy. The report A Fresh Start: Improving
Literacy and Numeracy, published in 1999,
outlines the research of a working group
which found that illiteracy levels were at
unacceptably high levels among the adult
population. Around 20% of those surveyed
were unable to give satisfactory responses to
basic numeracy and literacy questions. It
proposed a new national strategy involving a
number of government bodies, including
several key recommendations:
• there should be assessment on demand
for all adults whose basic skills fall below
a certain standard. To ensure progress is
maintained at an individual level, the
initiative should be linked to the new
individual learning accounts (see p. 142);
• the strategy should be linked wherever
possible with other initiatives, such as the
University for Industry (see p. 141),
workplace learning and help for the long¬
term unemployed; and
• the Basic Skills Agency (concerned with
improving literacy, numeracy and related
basic abilities in England and Wales)
127
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
should monitor the programme and ensure
the necessary funding is obtained. Targets
proposed by the working group in this area
are to double the number of learners from
250,000 a year to 500,000; and to increase
further education funding on the project
from the current £180 million a year to
over £350 million by 2001-02.
Targeting Resources at Areas of Need
Education Action Zones (EAZs) in England
are areas where local partnerships between
schools and the wider community seek to
develop new and imaginative approaches to
raising school standards. By the end of
January 1999, 25 EAZs had been created. A
further 50 zones are being created during the
course of 1999. Each EAZ will be allocated
substantial additional educational funding.
The Action Plans for Inner Cities scheme,
launched in March 1999, makes specific
provision for schools in inner city areas in
England to develop as Beacon or specialist
schools (see p. 137), and sets up schemes
where students from disadvantaged homes can
make greater use of school facilities outside
normal school hours. It also makes it easier,
through a loan system, for them to gain access
to a home computer.
Another scheme, Excellence in Cities, sets
out a three-year programme to improve the
education of able inner-city children. The
importance of setting children of roughly
equal ability to work together in core
curriculum subjects is being emphasised and a
range of appropriately varied teaching
programmes is being developed.
A further initiative is Fresh Start, in which,
in exceptional circumstances, under-achieving
schools are closed and then re-opened with
new management arrangements on the same
site.
Promoting Computer Technology
The National Grid for Learning (NGfL), an
on-line educational resource created by the
Government with the co-operation of the
telecommunications industry, is an important
means of encouraging and developing
computer literacy. Comprising
interconnecting learning networks and
education services based on the Internet, the
Grid will support teaching, learning, training
and administration in schools, colleges,
universities, libraries, workplaces and homes.
By 2002, the Government aims to have all
educational establishments connected to the
Grid, and has provided funding to ensure all
serving teachers achieve at least a basic
standard in computer literacy. Its plans for the
University for Industry (see p. 141) also
include a commitment to promoting computer
technology.
OVERVIEW OF THE EDUCATION
SYSTEM
Nursery, Primary and Secondary Levels
In Great Britain compulsory schooling starts
at the age of five. In England and Wales the
Government has guaranteed nursery
education places (see also p. 126) for all four
year olds whose parents would like them to
attend school from this age. Increasingly,
nursery school education is provided by
primary schools rather than specialised
nurseries. Greater provision for pre-school
education is also being made in Scotland.
Northern Ireland has a lower compulsory
school age of four and a single school entry
date in September each year.
The emphasis at the early stages of primary
school education is on children learning
through their own experience, and socialising
with their peers. Learning tends to take place
through the study of general topics of interest,
rather than formal academic subjects. Within
their first two years of education, it is expected
that most children will have mastered the
basics of reading and writing, and will be able
to perform simple numerical tasks without the
use of a calculator. A small proportion of
children do not begin their education in
mainstream state schools. Children with
disabilities (such as deafness or blindness) can
attend ‘special’ schools where teachers are
trained to respond to their particular needs.
From the age of seven school life becomes
increasingly structured. Children start to
study individual subjects (mathematics,

science, English, for example), as well as the
earlier topic-based approach to learning.
Secondary Education
The age of 11 (or sometimes 12 in Scotland) is
still an important landmark for many children.
At this age they progress from primary to
secondary education (although some will
attend ‘middle’ schools from around the ages
of nine to 13). At secondary schools, children
learn subjects in greater depth than in primary
schools. New subjects, such as drama,
individual sciences and foreign languages, are
introduced to the curriculum. Secondary
schools tend to be bigger than primary
schools, and many have a wider range of
resources. There is on average, for instance,
one computer for every nine secondary school
pupils in Britain, compared with an average of
one computer for every 18 primary school
pupils.
From 14 onwards children in secondary
schools spend time preparing for the public
examinations which mark the end of their
compulsory academic career. The General
Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is
the main examination taken by pupils in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland at the
age of 16. Students in Scotland at that age
take the Scottish Certificate of Education at
Standard Grade.
Independent Schools
There are approximately 2,500 independent
schools in the UK, where parents pay fees to
have their children educated. Around 7% of
children in Britain attend such schools.
Independent schools tend to offer more out-
of-school facilities (sporting or musical, for
example) to children; they also tend to have
smaller classes and often achieve excellent
examination results. Some, but not all,
independent schools favour a particular
religious tradition. Independent primarv
schools are generally called ‘prep schools’, and
tend to cater for a slightly wider age range
(seven to 13) than their counterparts in the state
sector. Schools for older pupils from 11, 12 or
13 to 18 or 19 include about 500 which are
often referred to as ‘public schools’. Fee-paving
independent schools providing full-time
education for five or more pupils of compulsory
school age must register by law with the
appropriate government department and are
subject to inspection. Many offer academic,
music, art and other scholarships, and bursaries
to help pupils from poorer families.
Post-compulsory Education
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
From the age of 16 students can stay within
the formal education system and spend
another two years preparing for a number of
advanced level qualifications, such as GCE
(General Certificate of Education) AS/A
levels and Advanced GNVQs (see p. 130).
These qualifications can be studied by
students in their existing schools, at a sixth
form college (in England and Wales) or in a
further education institution.
GCE A levels are internationally
recognised, with students taking a number of
subjects at this level (usually three), giving
them more opportunity to pursue their studies
in greater depth. A levels are one of the main
routes into higher education and emplovment
and are graded on a scale of A to E.
129
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
From September 2000 there will be a
number of changes to the post-16
curriculum, to encourage young people to
take a wider range of subjects at advanced
level. Among them are:
• a new Advanced Subsidiary
qualification, representing the first
half of a full A level and worth 50%
of the marks (to provide better
progression from GCSE into
advanced level study and to reduce
the numbers who drop out with
nothing to show for their efforts);
• new A level syllabuses, normally
made up of six modules and set at the
same standard as current syllabuses,
offering candidates the choice of
linear (end of course) or modular
(staged) assessment;
• a revised GNVQ^General National
Vocational Qualification—see below)
at Foundation, Intermediate and
Advanced levels, aiming to secure
consistent standards and more
rigorous manageable assessment;
• a new six-unit GNVQ^at advanced
level, equivalent in size and demand
to a single GCE A level and graded
on a similar A to E scale; and
• a new Key Skills qualification (see
below) to encourage all young people
to develop the essential skills of
communication, numeracy and
information technology (IT) to higher
levels.
In addition, students may study Advanced
Supplementary (AS) qualifications alongside
their A levels. AS qualifications are designed
as a means of broadening the curriculum
beyond the confines of the three-subject
course. They are studied in the same depth as
A levels, but in terms of volume of material
covered they take up only half the time.
Not everyone wants to remain at school
beyond the age of 16. Some young people
(around 30%) leave education altogether and
start in paid employment. Many attend
institutes of further education, which offer a
much wider range of courses than schools:
students attending them tend to be drawn
from a wider age-range than pupils at schools.
General National Vocational Qualifications
are an alternative to GCSE/GCE
qualifications and job-specific National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs—see below).
They are mainly taken by full-time students
aged 16 to 19, but can also be taken by adults
studying on a part-time basis. GNVQs
develop knowledge, skills and understanding
in broad vocational areas such as business,
health and social care, or tourism. They also
include Key Skills of communication,
numeracy and IT. GNVQs can be gained in
stages and can be mixed and matched with
other qualifications. They are available at
three levels—Foundation, Intermediate and
Advanced.
Further education institutions also offer
specific courses directly related to work and
leading to NVQs—based on national standards
of competence and which can be achieved at
Levels 1 to 5—in which practical work skills,
such as carpentry, hairdressing, office
administration and electrical engineering can be
learned. They also offer a wide range of other
open learning and day release courses, giving
students the flexibility to learn and apply new
skills in a package which best suits their
individual circumstances.
Broad equivalences of qualifications are as
follows:
Advanced GNVQ: two GCE A levels (NVQ.
Level 3)
Intermediate GNVQ: four GCSEs at grade
A*!-C (NVCILevel 2)
Foundation GNVQ: four GCSEs at grade
D-G (NVQ^Level 1).
Innovations in courses offered have
increasingly blurred the traditional
distinctions between the world of work and
the world of learning, for example, the
Modern Apprenticeships training scheme (see
p. 151). A new vocational qualification, called
Part One GNVQ_(and equivalent to two

EDUCATION
A White Paper, Learning to Succeed,
published in June 1999, announced
proposals for a new Learning and Skills
Council for England. The Council will
deliver all post-16 education and training
(excluding higher education) and assume
responsibility for:
• funding colleges from the Further
Education Funding Council for
England (see p. 135);
• advising the Government on the
National Learning Targets;
• funding Modern Apprenticeships,
National Traineeships and other
government-funded training and
workforce development from
Training and Enterprise Councils
(see chapter 11); and
• developing, in partnership with
LEAs, arrangements for adult and
community learning.
It is proposed that the Council will be
established in April 2001, and will work
through a network of up to 50 local
councils which will plan and co-ordinate
provision locally. Local Learning
Partnerships—including, as a core,
colleges, Training and Enterprise
Councils, local authorities and the careers
service, but also, in many instances,
employers, the voluntary and community
sector, schools, higher education
institutions and the Employment Service
(see p. 155)—will have a central role in
working with education providers to help
them address local skills needs.
GCSEs), is being made available to schools
and colleges from September 1999, and aims
to broaden choices for young people. It is
available in seven subject areas: art and design,
business, engineering, health and social care,
IT, leisure and tourism, and manufacturing.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority is responsible for accrediting
qualifications and for developing and
monitoring the school curriculum in England.
Corresponding bodies in Wales and Northern
Ireland perform similar functions.
Scotland
In Scotland education for those aged 16 to 18
has been reformed. Traditional, fairly
academically orientated ‘Highers’ (Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education) are
being replaced by new ‘Higher Still’ courses
and modules, which will offer students greater
flexibility and, through a revised assessment
system, more opportunities to demonstrate
successful educational achievement. It is
intended that the new system of Scottish
Highers should be fully in place by 2003. A
system of Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(SVQs)—analogous to NVQs-—offers students
a more practical, work-related alternative to
Highers. The Scottish Qualifications
Authority is the national accreditation body
and the main awarding organisation.
Higher Education and Beyond
Around a third of young people in England
and Wales, 40% in Scotland and 45% in
Northern Ireland go to university to study full¬
time as undergraduates. Students at university
usually spend three years researching a subject
in-depth and are awarded a Bachelor’s degree
(for example, Bachelor of Arts, BA; or
Bachelor of Science, BSc) on the successful
completion of their studies. There are some
four-year courses, and medical and veterinary
courses normally require five years. All
traditional first degree courses in Scotland
require a minimum of three years’ study (or
four years to honours level). Although a
university degree can directly prepare students
for a professional career in, for example,
medicine or law, most degrees offer students
broader courses in arts/humanities, science,
and many other disciplines.
A number of students go on to do
postgraduate studies. These usually lead to an
additional formally recognised qualification,
such as a Master’s degree (for example,
Master of Arts, MA; or Master of Science,
MSc) or doctorate (PhD).
A growing number of mature students
enter the higher education system. The option
of mature students staying in work while also
studying part-time for a qualification is
becoming increasingly popular.

THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW 1999
The Chelsea Flower Show—originally
the Royal Horticultural Society’s
Great Spring Show—was first held in
the Temple Gardens, Embankment,
London in 1888. In 1913 it moved to
its present site in the grounds of the
Royal Hospital, Chelsea—designed by
Sir Christopher Wren and the home
of the Chelsea Pensioners. The show
has taken place there almost every year
since then. In 1999 it was open to
the public from 25 to 28 May and
attracted 170,000 visitors.

EDUCATION
MANAGEMENT
School Admissions
LEAs and school governing bodies responsible
for admissions are expected to work with
headteachers, the Churches and others in local
forums to co-ordinate admissions
arrangements, taking account of statutory
codes of practice issued in England and Wales
in April 1999. In England disagreements are
referred to an independent adjudicator on
school organisation and admissions (although
disputes about religious or denominational
criteria are referred to the Secretary of State
for Education and Employment for
determination). In Wales, the National
Assembly decides in all cases of disagreement.
Admission authorities of schools with a
specialism in certain subjects are able to give
priority in admissions to up to 10% of pupils
by aptitude for their specialism. Admission
authorities are no longer allowed to introduce
selection by ability, and where existing partial
selection by ability is challenged, the
adjudicator decides whether it should
continue. Local parents are allowed to petition
for a ballot and (if sufficient numbers locally
wish it) to vote on whether individual
grammar schools should keep selective
admission arrangements or (in wholly selective
areas) whether the selective system should
continue.
Rights and Duties of Parents
Parents in England and Wales must be given
general information about a school through a
prospectus and the school’s annual report or,
in Scotland, the school’s handbook. They have
a statutory right to express a preference for a
particular school for their child, and there is
an appeal system if their choice is not met.
In England and Wales parents choosing a
local secondary school have the right to see:
• national performance tables showing the
latest public examination results,
vocational qualification results and rates
of absence on a school-by-school basis;
and
• information in each local school’s
prospectus on its public examination
results, vocational qualification results,
attendance rates and the destinations of
school-leavers.
Parents must also be given a written annual
school report on their child’s achievements
containing details about progress on all
subjects and activities; attendance record;
results of National Curriculum assessments
and public examinations; comparative results
of pupils of the same age in the school and
nationally; and arrangements for discussing
pupils’ reports with teachers.
Under the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, all schools are required
to have home—school agreements setting out
clearly what is expected of the school, parents
and pupils.
In Scotland information is published for
parents on school costs, examination results,
pupil attendance and absence, and the
destinations of school-leavers. Schools should
also provide parents with information about
their children’s attainment in the various
subjects, teachers’ comments on their progress,
and details about steps to build on success or
overcome difficulties. One main school report
each year is advised, together with one brief
update report.
The Northern Ireland system for reporting
to parents is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales.
Schools
Increasingly, schools are managed by a closer
partnership between the various parties
involved—government (see p. 124), LEAs
(library and education boards in Northern
Ireland), school governors and headteachers.
LEAs. The key duties of an LEA include
ensuring schools in its area meet government
performance targets. LEAs are required by¬
law to draw up an education development plan
(in England—a strategic plan in Wales) saying
how targets will be met, and have powers to
intervene if a school is shown to be causing
concern. Intervention can range from the
provision of advice to more drastic measures
(for example, closing a school) if more serious
problems are encountered. Other LEA duties
include:
133
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
maintaining control of capital
expenditure within its area;
establishing an admissions system with
the aim of ensuring that problems
associated with over- or under-
subscribed schools are kept to acceptable
levels;
taking responsibility for assessing
children with special educational needs
and for ensuring that parents with such
children are made aware of all the help
that is available to them; and
assuming responsibility for strategic
planning for its area (for example,
ensuring an adequate supply of teachers,
and implementing initiatives regarding
the provision of books and IT).
School governors. The governing body sets,
within the framework of legislation, the broad
strategy for a school’s development and is
responsible for the school’s budget. It is
usually made up of a number of parent, local
community, school staff and LEA
representatives. In England and Wales the
number of elected parent governors is being
increased, with at least one elected parent
governor serving on each LEA policy-making
education committee. The governing bodies of
church schools will also include church
representatives.
Headteachers. Together with other senior
members of staff, the headteacher has
responsibility for the leadership, direction and
management of the school, within the strategic
framework set by the governing body.
Inspection bodies. The Standards and
Effectiveness Unit and the Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) in
England, and separate inspection bodies for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, aim to
ensure that educational targets are met, and
that consistency is maintained through a
system of school inspections. All state schools
are regularly inspected by a team of
independent inspectors containing
educationalists and lay people. Reports are
published on inspections, and schools must act
on their recommendations. Schools in
England and Wales are normally inspected
every six years, but more often where
weaknesses are apparent. Between inspections,

school performance is regularly monitored by
LEAs, which aim to ensure that the school’s
improvement plans meet national guidelines
set out by the Government.
Recent codes of practice, introduced under
the School Standards and Framework Act
1998, set out the principles for the
management of schools in England and Wales,
for example, management should be about
raising standards and there should be zero-
tolerance of underperformance. Schools where
truancy rates are low and examination success
rates are high should be left, as far as
practicable, to manage their own affairs; and
the resources, specialist advice and
management expertise of the LEA should be
targeted at those schools in greatest need of
help.
Further and Higher Education
Further education institutions in the UK are
controlled by autonomous corporations and
134
EDUCATION
governing bodies, with substantial
representation from business. Public funding
to colleges in England, Wales and Scotland is
made through Further Education Funding
Councils. In Northern Ireland further
education colleges are financed by DENI.
Universities and higher education
institutions (around 170 in the UK) enjoy
academic freedom, appoint their own staff,
decide which students to admit and award
their own degrees. The number of universities
greatly increased in 1992, when polytechnics
and their Scottish equivalents were given their
own degree-awarding powers and were
allowed to take the university title. The oldest
universities, Oxford and Cambridge, date
from the 13th century.
Government finance for higher education
institutions (to help meet the costs of teaching,
research and related activities) is distributed
by Higher Education Funding Councils in
England, Wales and Scotland, and by DENI
in Northern Ireland. The private University
of Buckingham receives no public grants. As
well as teaching students, higher education
institutions undertake paid training, research
or consultancy for commercial firms. Many
establishments have endowments or receive
funds from foundations and benefactors.
In 1997 the National Committee of Inquiry
into Higher Education, under the
chairmanship of Lord Dearing, published its
report on the future development and funding
of the sector throughout the UK. The report
supported a further expansion of up to 40% in
higher education over the next 20 years and
made 93 recommendations, the majority of
which were accepted by the Government
when it gave its formal response to the
Committee in February 1998.
The Teaching and Higher Education Act
1998, implementing new funding and student
support arrangements, was approved by
Parliament in July 1998. The Government
judged that further improvement or expansion
of higher education was unaffordable on the
basis of the previous arrangements, and agreed
with the Dearing Committee that those who
benefit from higher education should
contribute more towards its costs. From
1998-99 most full-time students on first
degree and other comparable higher education
courses are asked to pay up to £1,000
(depending on their own, and their parents’ or
spouse’s, income) as a contribution towards
the costs of their tuition. The balance is paid
from public funds, through LEAs.
From 1999-2000 means-tested
maintenance grants will be replaced by
maintenance loans, part of which will also be
means-tested. Loans of at least £1,000 for
living costs will be available to make sure that
no student or family will have to pay more
during the course of studies than they would
under the arrangements for existing students.
Student support arrangements in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are administered by the
Student Awards Agency for Scotland and the
Northern Ireland education and library boards
respectively.
TEACHERS
England and Wales
New teachers at state primary and secondary
schools are required to be graduates. There
are currently two main ways of training to
become a teacher:
• taking a four-year Bachelor of Education
(BEd) degree at a university or college of
higher education. This involves combining
degree-level study of a specialist subject,
with the study of educational theories and
basic developmental psychology. Bachelor
of Education students are also required to
apply their knowledge and develop their
classroom management skills in a number of
attachments to local schools, where they
teach a limited timetable under the
supervision of an experienced teacher; or
• taking a first degree (BA or BSc) where
students concentrate entirely on a
specialist subject, followed by a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education
(PGCE) covering the theory and practice
of education.
Primary school teachers tend to study for a
BEd, whereas secondary school teachers, who
require more specialist subject knowledge,
tend to study for a PGCE.
A consultation document, Teachers: meeting
the challenge of change, issued by the DfEE at
135
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the end of 1998, outlines plans for the
development of the teaching profession in
England. Key aspects include:
• ensuring that all trainee teachers,
including those on employment-based
routes, meet the new standards for the
award of Qualified Teacher Status before
they can qualify to teach;
• establishing a General Teaching Council
for England, due in 2000, which will have
responsibility for overseeing every aspect
of the teaching profession;
• providing more training for headteachers
(with mandatory qualifications for new
headteachers being introduced by 2002);
• introducing a new pay system for
teachers, providing greater opportunities
for career progression;
• allocating to teacher training colleges
resources to ensure all teachers meet the
required standards in numeracy, literacy
and computer skills;
• requiring newly qualified teachers taking
up their first teaching post to go through
a further induction period, enabling them
to consolidate their teaching skills; and
• creating a fast-track scheme to attract
able graduates to the teaching
profession and increasing substantially
the number of classroom assistants and
support staff.
These arrangements will be tested in the
1999-2000 academic year and will apply from
September 2000. Similar reforms to the
teaching profession are under consideration in
Wales.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland all teachers in education authority
schools must be registered with the General
Teaching Council for Scotland. All entrants to
the profession are graduates. New primary
teachers qualify either through a four-year
BEd or one-year postgraduate course.
Secondary school teachers must undertake a
one-year postgraduate training course or an
undergraduate course combining subject
studies, study of education and school
experience. Newly qualified teachers must
serve a two-year probationary period at the
beginning of their teaching careers.
In Northern Ireland all new entrants to
teaching in grant-aided schools are graduates
and hold an approved teaching qualification.
The principal training courses are BEd
Honours (four years) and the one-year
Postgraduate Certificate of Education.
THE CURRICULUM
Schools
England and Wales
The subjects taught to children between the
ages of five and 16 in state schools are to a large
extent determined by the National Curriculum,
which has four key stages (see Table 10.5) At
each of the four stages the core subjects of
English (and in Wales, Welsh), mathematics,
science, technology, physical education, and
religious education are taught. History,
geography, art and music are also compulsory
subjects in the earlier stages of the curriculum.
A modern foreign language (usually French or
German) is added to the curriculum at Key
Stages Three and Four. For Key Stage Four
the study of history, geography, art and music
becomes optional; in Wales a modern foreign
language is optional at Key Stage Four. Other
subjects, such as drama, dance, and classical
languages, remain on the curriculum, but the
teaching of them is optional, depending on the
resources of individual schools.

The National Curriculum also contains
general requirements for each subject and, for
each Key Stage, programmes of study
outlining what pupils should be taught, as well
136
EDUCATION
as attainment targets setting out expected
standards of pupils’ performance.
There are varying levels of achievement in
each subject which form the basis of the
attainment targets for pupils. The National
Curriculum outlines by what age the majority
of pupils should normally be expected to reach
these various targets. The attainment targets
are designed to be more challenging as pupils
get older.
For the period from September 1998 until
2000 the Government introduced a slimmed-
down curriculum for primary schools for
foundation subjects. These interim
arrangements are designed to give teachers
more time to focus on meeting government
targets for raising standards in literacy and
numeracy. In England national numeracy and
literacy strategies have been introduced,
requiring all schools to have a literacy and
numeracy study hour each day. Less
prescriptive literacy and numeracy
frameworks are applicable in Wales.
Following a review of the National
Curriculum by the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority, decisions on a
revised National Curriculum for schools in
England, applicable from September 2000,
were announced by the DfEE in
September 1999. These aim to provide
greater coherence in the way schools
prepare pupils for their role and
responsibility as adults and for their future
working lives, and include the creation of
citizenship as a new curriculum subject
(from 2002) and a non-statutory
framework for the teaching of personal,
social and health education.
Some categories of school in England are
given the chance to build reputations for
excellence within specific areas of the
curriculum. Pupils attending City Technology
Colleges—independent secondary schools
created by a partnership of government and
business sponsors—follow a course of study
meeting all the requirements of the National
Curriculum, but use the flexibility given to
them to devote more time and resources to the
study of science and technology subjects.
‘Specialist’ schools are state secondary schools
specialising in technology, science and
mathematics; modern foreign languages;
sport; or the arts—in addition to providing the
full National Curriculum. A specialist school
must have the backing of private sector
sponsors. Capital and annual grants are
available from public funds to complement
business sponsorship. In December 1998 there
were 330 designated specialist schools in
England, including 227 technology colleges,
58 language colleges, and 26 sports and 19 arts
colleges. By 2003 nearly one in four of all
secondary schools will be a specialist school.
A further initiative (in England), aiming to
give more pupils greater flexibility in the
subjects they are expected to study, is the
Government’s Beacon School programme.
This involves existing schools applying for
Beacon School status, and being allocated
additional funding to act as pioneers of
educational innovation. Additional funding is
conditional on Beacon Schools giving formal
help to other schools in their area.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland content and management of the
curriculum are not prescribed by statute,
responsibility resting with education
authorities and headteachers. Government
guidelines on the structure and balance of the
curriculum for five to 14 year olds have been
issued, covering English, mathematics,
expressive arts, Latin, Gaelic, modern
languages, environmental studies and religious
and moral education. For those aged 14 to 16
the curriculum includes study of language and
communications, mathematics, science,
technology, social studies, creative activities,
physical education, and religious and moral
education. Provision is made for teaching
Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas.
The Northern Ireland curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools,
consists of religious education (see also p. 239)
and six broad areas of study: English,
mathematics, science and technology, the
environment and society, creative and
expressive studies and, in secondary schools
and some primary schools, language studies.
The common curriculum also has two cross-
137
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
curricular themes: cultural heritage and
education for mutual understanding. A small
number of pupils attend Irish-medium
schools, where they receive their lessons in
Irish.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to careers information, advice and
guidance. All schools have been encouraged to
draw up partnership agreements with their
local careers service in developing
programmes of careers education and
guidance. All state secondary schools in
England and Wales, and primary and
secondary schools in Northern Ireland,
provide school-leavers with a Record of
Achievement, setting out their school
attainments, including public examination and
National Curriculum assessment results. In
Scotland the National Record of Achievement
has been replaced by a Progress File.
Work Experience
The Government is committed to extending
the range and quality of vocational and work-
related opportunities for pupils in the 14-16
age-group. Since October 1998 the School
Standards and Framework Act enables schools
in England and Wales to offer more flexible
work-related learning choices, by allowing
pupils to take up placements at any time in
their last two years of compulsory schooling.
Business and Community Links
The Government recognises that
school-business links can help raise pupils’
levels of achievement and enable them to see
the relevance of what they learn at school. It is
continuing to support the Education Business
Partnership Network. Education Business
Partnerships comprise representatives from
industry, education and the wider community,
and aim to bring about closer links between
education and industry in order to ensure that
young people develop the necessary skills to
help them succeed in the labour market.
The Government has also stated its
commitment to increasing the availability to
pupils of mentoring initiatives, whereby
people experienced in business can help to
inspire and motivate groups or individuals.
In Scotland the Education for Work
programme has been launched for the ongoing
development of business-education links.
Further and Higher Education
After compulsory school age (16) education
institutions offer students a wide choice of
academic and vocational courses and
qualifications. In order to help employers and
others with an interest in education interpret
the relative merits of the array of educational
and training qualifications available, some work
has been done in assessing the comparability of
the various options available—see p. 130 for the
broad equivalences in qualifications.
At universities and institutions of higher
education first or higher degrees (see p. 131)
in one or two specialist academic subjects
remain the cornerstone of study. There is
evidence though that universities are
becoming more flexible in their approach to
learning, with many of them (particularly the
former polytechnics) offering term-long
placements in work environments to students
in addition to their more theoretical courses of
study.
ASSESSMENT
Schools
England and Wales
Since September 1998 (September 1999 in
Wales) baseline assessment for children aged
four to five has become statutory. All children
of that age are assessed within seven weeks of
first entering primary school on their language
skills, mathematical skills, and personal and
social skills. Teachers are able to use the
information from the assessments to plan their
teaching to match children’s individual needs.
At the end of Key Stages One, Two and
Three of the National Curriculum formal
assessment of children is carried out. At Key
138
EDUCATION
Stage One this takes the form of classroom
tasks, and at Key Stages Two and Three
national tests and tasks. The national tests,
which every state-educated child has to sit,
assess for each core subject within the
National Curriculum. The test and task
results help teachers determine, along with
their own assessments, which attainment
target level their pupils have reached.
National Curriculum assessment performs
three main functions:
• to inform the Government whether, at a
national level, pupils are developing the
skills they will need as adults;
• to assess the performance of schools and
teachers in helping children to learn a
specific and standardised body of skills
and knowledge; and
• to identify directly particular strengths
and weaknesses in individual pupils.
Knowledge and skills acquired by pupils
throughout the Key Stages of the curriculum
are formally tested in the public examinations
(GCSEs for most pupils in England and
Wales) that they take at the end of their
compulsory school career.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland there are standardised tests in
English and mathematics at five levels within
the five to 14 age range. Pupil assessment in
Northern Ireland, which is statutory, is broadly
in line with practice in England and Wales.
Children with Special Educational Needs
A child is said to have special educational
needs (SEN) if he or she has a learning
difficulty which needs special provision. A
child has learning difficulties if he or she has
significantly greater difficulty in learning than
most children of the same age or a disability
which makes it difficult to use the normal
educational facilities in the area. Every child
has the right to receive a broad and balanced
curriculum. For pupils with SEN planning
should take account of each pupil’s particular
learning and assessment requirements.
England and Wales. Around 1.66 million
pupils in England are identified as having
special educational needs. The vast majority
are educated in mainstream schools, but
around 98,000 pupils with more severe and
complex needs attend special schools. State
schools must try to provide for pupils with
SEN and publish information about their
SEN policy. LEAs must identify and assess
the needs of those children with more severe
or complex needs and involve parents in
decisions about their child’s education. If an
LEA believes that it should determine the
education for the child, it must draw up a
formal statement of the child’s special needs
and the action it intends to take to meet them.
Wherever possible, children with SEN should
be taught in mainstream schools. The LEA is
required to comply with the parents’ choice of
school unless this is inappropriate for the
child, or incompatible with the efficient
education of other children or with the
efficient use of resources. Parents have a right
of appeal to the Special Educational Needs
Tribunal if they disagree with the LEA’s
decision about their child. The Tribunal’s
verdict is final and binding on all parties.
A statutory code of practice offers guidance
to all LEAs and state schools in England and
Wales on identifying and assessing the needs
of pupils with SEN.
In November 1998 the Government
published Meeting Special Educational Needs:
A programme of action, setting out its strategy
for raising standards for children with SEN in
England. The main themes are:
• developing the knowledge and skills of all
staff working with children with SEN;
• improving the SEN framework and
developing a more inclusive education
system; and
• working in partnership with parents and
carers.
Under the Schools Access Initiative in
England, £100 million will be made available
over three years to make mainstream schools
more accessible to pupils with disabilities.
Further resources have been given to aid the
expansion of parent partnership services, and
for staff training and development in SEN.
139
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Scotland. The choice of school is a matter
for agreement between education authorities
and parents. Education authorities must take
special educational needs fully into account
when making provision for pupils in their
areas. There are a small number of pupils
(about 2% of the school population) whose
needs require the authority to open a record
describing the special education necessary to
meet them. This process incorporates a right
of appeal.
Northern Ireland. Similar arrangements to
those in England and Wales, including an
appeal system, are in force.
Assessment in Further and Higher
Education
Further and higher education courses tend to
be assessed by a mixture of coursework and
examinations. However, with the shift towards
more flexible and practical courses in all
educational institutions, the traditional written
examination is steadily becoming a less
important part of the assessment process. This
is particularly so in the case of adult
education, through w hich the Government’s
commitment to promoting a culture of lifelong
learning will be developed (see p. 141).
Educational Achievement
There are variations in educational
achievement throughout the UK. In 1998 girls
outperformed boys in all National Curriculum
teacher assessments and many National
Curriculum tests between Key Stages One
and Three. At GCSE level girls are much
more likely than boys to obtain passes in
English, foreign languages and history. At
A level choices of subject studied vary for boys
and girls, with males making up over three-
fifths of mathematics entrants and females
making up a similar proportion of English
entrants.
In Northern Ireland, 55% of 16 year olds
obtained five or more GCSE grade A* to C
passes in 1998, while in England and Wales in
the same year only 46% achieved the same
standard.
Notable variations in educational
participation and achievement can be seen
across different ethnic groups (see Table
10.6). The Government is investing over
£430 million in a new ethnic minority
achievement grant over three years from
1999-2000. Under this grant schools are
expected to establish policies to help raise the
attainment of ethnic minority pupils at risk of
underperforming.
English language teaching continues to
receive priority for pupils without English as
their first language. Schools may also teach the
main ethnic minority community languages at
secondary level in England and Wales as part
of the National Curriculum. They should take
account of the ethnic and cultural
backgrounds of pupils, and curricula should
reflect ethnic and cultural diversity.
ADULT EDUCATION AND LIFELONG
LEARNING
Adult Education
Further education for adults is provided by
further education institutions, adult education
centres and colleges run by LEAs, and
voluntary bodies such as the Workers’
Educational Association. 4 he duty to secure
such education is shared by the Further
Education Funding Councils, LEAs and
DENI. University departments of continuing
education also provide courses for adults.
The Further Education Funding Councils
and DENI fund formal academic and vocational
programmes, courses leading to access to higher
education, and courses in basic literacy and
numeracy, including English for speakers of
other languages. LEAs are responsible for the
less formal leisure and recreational courses.
These bodies must take account of adult
students with special educational needs.
Adult education has seen substantial changes
in the past few years. The Lifelong Learning
agenda and the University for Industry (see
p. 141) will help to increase access to relevant
learning opportunities and enhance
employability and performance in the workplace.
(More details on training opportunities open to
adults can be found in chapter 11.)

Lifelong Learning
In 1998 the DfEE issued proposals for a major
new strategy to encourage the continuous
development of everybody’s skills, knowledge
and understanding, which the Government
believes is essential for business competitiveness,
individual employability and personal fulfilment.
Separate but parallel learning strategies for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were also
published. The concept of developing a culture
of lifelong learning will underpin all areas of
post-16 educational provision.
The Adult and Community Learning Fund,
launched in 1998, supports community-based
activities, including learning opportunities in
familiar relevant surroundings attractive to
people who feel excluded from mainstream
education. Some £20 million is being made
available for the period to March 2002. Over 160
projects have been set up to promote
community-based learning through the Fund.
A new Adult Learning Committee will
have direct responsibility for advising the
Learning and Skills Council (see p. 131) on
achieving the National Learning Targets (see
p. 127) for adults and for organisations.
for adult students of all ages. Teaching is
through a combination of specially produced
printed texts, correspondence tuition,
television and radio broadcasts, audio/video
cassettes and, for some courses, computing and
short residential schools. There is a network of
study centres for contact with part-time tutors
and counsellors, and with fellow students.
Students do not need formal academic
qualifications to register for most courses.
Its first degrees are the BA (Open) or the
BSc (Open), which are general degrees
awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. Either degree can be awarded with
honours. The OU now offers honours degrees
in selected subject areas. There is also an
MMath degree for students who have taken an
approved combination of courses specialising
in mathematics, and an MEng degree for those
who have studied an approved combination of
courses to achieve the highest professional
status of Chartered Engineer. About 200,000
first degrees have been awarded since the
University opened in 1970. The OU offers a
wide range of postgraduate courses, and of the
Masters of Business Administration (MBAs)
awarded in the UK 25% are from the OU.
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
141
University for Industry (UJI)
The Ufl, one of the Government’s main
innovations for lifelong learning, is intended
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
to bring new learning opportunities to the
home, the workplace and the community. It
will be launched nationally in autumn 2000,
and will cover England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. It will work closely with a separate
Scottish Ufl, which will be tailored to the
distinctive Scottish education system,
institutions and industrial structure.
Using new technologies and a network of
learning centres, the Ufl will promote learning
ranging from basic skills of literacy and
numeracy to specialised technological skills
and business management. It is intended to
play a key role in improving the nation’s
competitiveness by raising skill levels and
employability.
The Government has allocated £44 million
in 1999-2000 for the Ufl to take forward its
development and implementation plans, and
the aim is to set up around 1,000 learning
centres by March 2001. The first learning
centres should be operational by November
1999.
Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs)
To encourage a culture of lifelong learning, the
Government proposes the introduction of
individual learning accounts. These will help
individuals to save and borrow for investment in
their own development. ILAs will be available
to everyone, and will be used, at the learner’s
choice, to pay for learning—whether an evening
class or a programme bought through the Ufl.
ILAs will act as a vehicle for funding
continuous learning where the Government,
employers and the individual can all have a part
to play. The March 1999 Budget announced a
range of new incentives for learning account
holders. Any adult with an individual learning
account will be able to claim a discount of 20%
on learning and a higher discount of 80% for
specific courses, including computer literacy.
The discounts apply on a course cost limit of
£500 per person a year.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the UK to study, and many British
people work and train overseas. The British aid
programme (see chapter 7, p. 93) encourages
links between educational institutions in the
UK and developing countries.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU’s
SOCRATES programme through
ERASMUS (the European Community
Action Scheme for the Mobility of Students),
which provides grants to enable university
students from the EU and from Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein to study in other
states. The programme covers all academic
subjects, and the period of study normally
lasts between three and 12 months.
SOCRATES also promotes competence in
foreign languages through the LINGUA
scheme. Other parts of the programme
support partnerships between schools, study
visits by senior educationalists and a range of
multinational projects including open and
distance learning, adult education and education
for the children of migrant workers, gypsies and
travellers. Around 2,000 UK schools have taken
part in transnational SOCRATES partnerships.
A new phase of the SOCRATES programme
will begin on 1 January 2000.
The LEONARDO DA VINCI programme
supports and complements vocational training
policies and practices in the EU member states
(and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, ten
Central and Eastern European countries and
Cyprus), fostering transnational co-operation
and innovation in training through pilot
projects, exchanges and research projects.
The Youth for Europe programme supports
youth exchange projects in EU member states
and related activities such as youth leader
training. The third phase of the programme,
which began in 1995, runs to the end of 1999.
The 15 EU member states, together with
the European Commission, work together in
funding and running ten European Schools,
which provide mother-tongue education for
children, aged four to 18, of staff employed at
EU institutions. One of the schools is located
in the UK, at Culham in Oxfordshire
142
Overseas Students in the UK
British universities and other higher and
further education establishments have built up
EDUCATION
a strong reputation overseas by offering
tuition of the highest standards and
maintaining low student-to-staff ratios. About
270,000 overseas students are now studying in
the UK at publicly funded higher and further
education institutions.
Most overseas students following courses of
higher or further education pay fees covering
the full cost of their courses. Nationals of
other EU member states generally pay the
lower level of fees applicable to British home
students.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
through its international development
programme and other award and scholarship
schemes. Some 4,500 overseas students from
about 150 countries currently receive awards
from scholarship schemes funded in part by
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
and the Department for International
Development (DFID). The two main schemes
funded by the FCO and DFID are:
• British Chevening Scholarships, a
worldwide programme offering
outstanding graduate students and young
professionals the opportunity to study at
British universities and other academic
institutions. An increasing number of
these scholarships are jointly funded with
British or foreign commercial firms and
with academic or other institutions.
There are now over 600 such
scholarships; and
• the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, offering scholarships for
study in other Commonwealth countries.
Under the scheme in the UK
scholarships are for postgraduate study
or research for one to three years at
British higher education institutions.
Other Schemes
Many other public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known are the
British Council Fellowships, the Fulbright
Scholarship Scheme, the British Marshall
Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, the
Churchill Scholarships and the Confederation
of British Industry Scholarships. The Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded by
the Higher Education Funding Councils, also
provides help for overseas full-time
postgraduate students with outstanding
research potential. Most British universities
and colleges offer bursaries and scholarships for
which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (five to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional voluntary
organisations. In England the service is
estimated to reach around 3 million young
people, with the voluntary organisations
contributing a significant proportion of overall
provision.
In England the DfEE supports the youth
service through grants to the National Youth
Agency, the National Council for Voluntary
Youth Services and National Voluntary Youth
Organisations. Funded primarily by local
government, the National Youth Agency
provides support for those working with
young people and for information and
publishing services.
The Wales Youth Agency is the agent for
payment of grant aid to national youth service
bodies with headquarters in Wales; it is also
responsible for the accreditation of training
and staff development for youth workers.
In Scotland the youth service forms part of
the community education provision made by
local authorities. It is also promoted by
Community Learning Scotland. The Scottish
Executive gives grants to voluntary youth
organisations to help them with their
headquarters expenditure and staff training.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund facilities for
143
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
recreational, social, physical, cultural and
youth service activities. They assist with the
running costs of registered voluntary youth
units, and provide advice and support to
youth groups. Boards also help young people
visiting the rest of the UK, the Irish Republic
and overseas. The Youth Council for
Northern Ireland advises the education system
on the development of the youth service. It
promotes the provision of facilities,
encourages cross-community activity and pays
grants to the headquarters of voluntary bodies.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth activities
through local groups, which raise most of their
day-to-day expenses by their own efforts. Many
receive financial and other help from local
authorities, which also make facilities available
in many areas. The voluntary organisations vary
greatly in character and include the uniformed
organisations, such as the Scouts and Girl
Guides. Some organisations are church-based.
Some also represent Jews and Muslims. In
Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young Welsh
speakers and learners.
Thousands of youth clubs encourage their
members to take part in sport, cultural and
other creative activities. Some youth clubs
provide information, counselling and advice.
Many voluntary youth organisations and
local authorities provide services for the young
unemployed, young people from ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Many authorities have youth
committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented. They employ youth
officers to co-ordinate youth work and to
arrange in-service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth and
community workers; several undergraduate
part-time and postgraduate courses are also
available. In Scotland one-, two- and three-year
courses are provided at teacher education
institutions. Students from Northern Ireland
attend courses run in universities and colleges in
the UK and the Irish Republic.
Other Organisations
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and organisations;
areas of concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness, and young
offenders. Efforts are also made to assist
ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from the UK and
other Commonwealth countries to meet
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, social and
practical skills, and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to help
those in need, including elderly and disabled
people. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum.
Millennium Volunteers
The Millennium Volunteer programme offers
young people aged 16-24 the opportunity to
make a contribution to their communities by
making a sustained commitment to voluntary
activity. Its main aims are the personal
development of young people and benefit to
the community. Activities may range from
helping with reading in schools and hospital
visiting to working on projects to improve the
environment or sporting and cultural life.

The labour market in the United Kingdom has undergone major changes, with
many more women in the workforce, increased levels of part-time working and
the continuing move towards employment in service industries, where over
three-quarters of employees now work.
The Government provides help, in the form of financial assistance, practical
advice and training, for people who find it difficult to find work. It has created
a variety of traineeships giving young people the skills and experience they
need to enter the labour market and it also encourages those already in work to
develop their skills through its lifelong learning initiatives. Legislation gives
protection to those in the workplace, in particular the low-paid.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the
absence of a formal, state-supported benefit
system (most notably, the lack of pensions
and child benefit) meant that for many
people engaging in some form of paid
employment was their only means of
supporting themselves. The 1901 Census
noted that over 10% of boys aged between
ten and 14 (around 140,000) were already
‘engaged in occupations’. Nearly 40% of
men aged 75 and upwards (around 110,000)
were still working. Most women tended to
leave paid employment once they got
married to devote themselves more fully to
their domestic duties. More than half of
unmarried women were actively engaged in
paid employment, whereas only around 13%
(less than 1 million) of married or widowed
women were still working.
The range of available jobs was limited by
today’s standards. Male employees
dominated transport and business-related
occupations. Manufacturing provided an
increasingly large share of the available jobs,
and the demand for female and child labour
was particularly high in the textile
industries. Affluent private households were
another big employer in the labour market:
over 40% of women in paid employment at
the time worked as maids, cooks or cleaners
or were engaged in some other form of
domestic service.

THE LABOUR MARKET
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
Some 29.2 million people aged 16 and over
were classed as economically active1 in the UK
in April-June 1999, of whom 27.4 million
were in employment: 15.1 million men and
12.3 million women (see Table 11.1).
Employment is growing following a decline
during the recession of the early 1990s: the
Labour Force Survey (LFS), an official
measure of labour market activity produced by
the Office for National Statistics (ONS), notes
that the number of people aged 16 and over in
employment rose by 347,000 in the year to
April-June 1999. Employment levels are now
at their highest ever recorded.
One of the most significant long-term
trends in the labour market has been the
growth in the number of women in
employment. Women now account for around
45% of all those in the labour force in the UK,
and economic activity rates for women with
children under five have risen from 47% to
57% over the past decade. In most service
industries more than half of employees are
women, while in manufacturing, construction,
agriculture, and transport and
communications women account for less than
one-third of employees.
Part-time workers over the age of 16 now
total 6.8 million. About 44% of women work
part-time, compared with 9% of men.
The proportion of employee jobs in service
industries has more than doubled in the last 40
years, to around 75% of available jobs. There
has also been a gradual move away from manual
to non-manual occupations, which are now
held by around 60% of those in employment.
The private sector share of employment
rose from 71% in 1981 to 82% in mid-1998.
The number of employees in the public sector
fell from a peak of over 7.4 million in 1979 to
around 5 million in mid-1998, reflecting
privatisation of a number of major industries
(see p. 386).
Around 1.3 million people have two or
more jobs, while roughly 1.7 million (7% of
employees) are engaged in temporary jobs (see
1 Defined as those who are either in employment
(employee, self-employed, unpaid family worker or on a
government-supported training programme) or unemployed
and actively seeking work.
Reasons for the greater involvement of
women in the workplace are complex:
• more women are putting off having
children until their thirties, and when
they do have children, they are far
more likely to go back to work and
make use of the growing number of
available childcare options than they
were a generation ago;
• many of the new jobs available in the
service sector, particularly those
involving computers and telephones,
are areas where women can compete
for jobs with men on equal terms;
whereas many of the more traditional
jobs, which are declining in number,
particularly those in the mining,
construction and heavy engineering
industries, require a degree of
physical strength which puts women
at a disadvantage; and
• they are partly the result of legislative
change and positive action on the part
of employers. One business-led
campaign, Opportunity Now, with a
membership of over 350 organisations,
has encouraged employers to tackle
barriers to women’s progress and
promote an inclusive culture in the
workplace.
Table 11.3). Around one in three people work
in temporary jobs because they cannot find a
permanent one. A similar proportion work in
temporary jobs because they prefer to do so.
‘Teleworking’—people working from home
using information technology (IT)—is
becoming more widespread. In spring 1999
some 255,000 people were classed as
teleworkers whose main job was primarily in
their own home; extending the definition to
cover those working in different places using
home as a base and those who spent at least
one day a week working from home raised the
number to 1.32 million.
Around 3.2 million people are self-
employed in the UK: 16% of men and 7% of
women in employment are self-employed.
Agriculture and fishing, and construction have

THE LABOUR MARKET
the highest proportions of self-employed
people, while relatively few of those engaged
in manufacturing and public administration
are self-employed.
Employment by Sector
The shift in jobs from manufacturing to
service industries has continued in the past
decade (see Table 11.4). In the year to March
1999 the number of workforce jobs, a measure
of the total number of jobs, rather than the
number of employees, in service industries rose
to nearly 21 million. Employment in most
service sectors grew.
Transport and communications was one
service sector to record a particularly large rise
in workforce jobs in the year to March 1999,
with the number of jobs up by 4.7% from the
previous year to 1.7 million. A contributory
factor was the growth in telephone call centres,
which are run by several companies, for
example in banking, other financial services,
retailing and transport. Call centres employ
large numbers of people to deal with customer
requests, and computer telephonists are one of
the fastest growing occupational groups in the
UK. The continuing growth in the number of
mobile telephones in use in the UK (see
p. 378) has also accounted for a large number of
new jobs in this sector.
In the last ten years most other sectors
have experienced lower levels of employment.
Traditional manufacturing industries, such as
steel and shipbuilding, have recorded
particularly large falls in employment. By
March 1999 manufacturing accounted for
17% of employees in employment, compared
with 42% in 1955. In March 1999 employee
jobs in the main manufacturing sectors
included:
• 528,000 jobs in metal and metal products;
• 517,000 in electrical and optical
equipment;
• 480,000 in food products, beverages and
tobacco;
• 471,000 in paper, pulp, printing,
publishing and recording media; and
• 312,000 in clothing, textiles, leather and
leather products.
Service sector jobs have continued to rise
for a number of reasons:
• technological developments, such as the
growth of the Internet, have created a
significant demand for new jobs—for
example, IT technicians install, maintain,

UK continues to enjoy international
success, in terms of attracting foreign
business and leading the world in the
quality of services provided; and
• the growth in jobs in areas such as public
relations and marketing reflects the
worldwide increase in jobs related to the
dissemination of information.
Unemployment
Unemployment in the UK has fallen
considerably since the peak at the end of 1992.
In April-June 1999, 1.8 million people were
unemployed, 6.0% of those in the labour
market, compared with 6.3% in the same
period of 1998, according to the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of
unemployment as measured by the Labour
Force Survey. Some 501,000 people had been
unemployed for more than a year, of whom
301,000 had been out of work for over two
years.
Unemployment among 16 to 24 year olds is
running at double the overall rate. Reasons for
youth unemployment are likely to be
associated with their relative lack of skills,
qualifications and experience. Unemployment
rates tend to fall as the level of qualification
increases. In spring 1999, the unemployment
rate for those with no qualifications was
around four times higher than for those with a
higher educational qualification.
Among people with broadly similar
educational qualifications, those from ethnic
minorities tend to have higher unemployment
rates than those from the White group.
Unemployment rates are particularly high for
young Black people.
Comparing unemployment internationally,
the UK rate is similar to that for the major G7
group of nations and substantially lower than
that for the EU average.
Areas that used to rely on heavy industries
(such as steel, shipbuilding and coal mining)
which have since declined are often among
those with the highest rates of unemployment.
Areas with the lowest levels of unemployment
include the South East and East of England,
with rates well below the UK average.
LABOUR MARKET POLICY
Key aspects of the Government’s labour
market policies include promoting job creation
and helping people to overcome the barriers
preventing them moving from welfare into
work. Among the issues which it is tackling
are:
• improving the employability of
unemployed people;
• removing the barriers in the tax and
benefits system which act as a disincentive
for people to move from welfare into work
(see p. 405 and chapter 12);
• providing minimum legal standards at
work, such as on individual employment
rights; and
• tackling the social exclusion brought
about by long-term unemployment (see
chapter 9).
Government policies include the Welfare-to-
Work programme (see pp. 154-5), education
and training programmes, the national
minimum wage (see p. 156) and its
employability initiative.
Employability Initiative
‘Employability’ was an important theme when
the UK held the Presidency of the European
Union (EU) in 1998 and was also the focus of
a special conference of the G8 (group of
leading industrialised countries) in the UK in
the same year. EU member states have signed
up to producing annual ‘action plans’ which
outline how their policies respond to agreed
employment guidelines on employability,
adaptability (in businesses and their
employees), entrepreneurship and equal
opportunities between men and women. G8
countries have also produced similar action
plans. The UK remains instrumental in
shaping both processes. Action on
employability is an essential part of the drive
to develop a skilled, trained and adaptable
labour force and flexible labour market,
supported by minimum standards of fairness
150
THE LABOUR MARKET
and decency, including the national minimum
wage (see p. 156).
TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Education and training are among the
Government’s top priorities (see also chapter
10) and are considered essential for ensuring
that the UK workforce has the necessary skills
to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing
world economy. According to the LFS, in
spring 1999, 3.7 million employees of working
age in the UK had received job-related
training in the previous four weeks, 15.9% of
such employees. Employees with higher level
qualifications are almost six times more likely
to have received training than those with no
qualifications; younger employees are about
two-and-a-half times more likely to have
received training than older employees.
Connexions
In June 1999 the Government published the
White Paper Learning to Succeed, in which it
announced its proposals to improve
participation and attainment of those aged 16
to 19. The White Paper included measures
affecting schools, colleges and work-based
training, as well as a new focus for the Careers
Service. This strategy is called Connexions,
key elements of which include:
• creating a Youth Support Service as a
single new source of advice and support
for young people;
• providing better learning opportunities
by bringing further education and
training provision closer together and
offering three main alternatives—general
academic education, high-quality
vocational education, and part-time study
while working; and
• offering more unified and improved
financial incentives and support,
including the extension of Educational
Maintenance Allowances (see p. 126) to
help young people stay in learning.
Connexions plans to ensure that all young
people have access to high-quality education
and training, irrespective of whether they opt
to take up education in a school sixth form,
further education college or work-based
training through an apprenticeship,
traineeship or other arrangement. In addition,
under the Welfare-to-Work programme (see
p. 154), all young unemployed people are
guaranteed education and training
opportunities, while those with poor basic
skills have the option of participating in full¬
time study on an approved course.
National Traineeships are an important
part of the Government’s strategy. They offer
broad and flexible learning programmes,
including the key skills of communication,
numeracy and IT, and operate to agreed
national standards—National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ) at Level 2 (see chapter
10) is the primary qualification to be
achieved—set by industry and employers in
40 industry sectors. At the end of March
1999, nearly 36,000 young people had started
training on National Traineeships, with a
government target of 100,000 by March 2000.
Modern Apprenticeships are designed to
increase significantly the number of young
people trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. The primary achievement
of a Modern Apprenticeship is the NVQ^at
Level 3. Evaluation studies have found that
Modern Apprenticeships are of high quality,
are very popular and have met the
expectations of both employers and young
people. At the end of March 1999, around
134,500 young people were on Modern
Apprenticeships.
In Scotland the government-funded
training programme for young people is
Skillseekers; all young people aged 16 and 17
are entitled to Skillseekers training. Its key
elements are training leading to a recognised
qualification, up to Scottish Vocational
Qualification (SVQ) Level 3; an individual
training plan; and employer involvement.
Other Training and Support
Programmes
In addition to Modern Apprenticeships and
National Traineeships, a range of other
training opportunities are available:
151
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• The right to time off for study or training
for 16 and 17 year olds is coming into
effect in Great Britain from September
1999. Under this measure, young people
will be entitled to take paid time off to
study or train towards a qualification,
usually at NVQJLevel 2.
• The Improving the Training Market
programme covers activities funded by
the Department for Education and
Employment (DfEE), aimed at
encouraging investment by individuals in
lifelong learning, and at improving the
quality, impact and cost-effectiveness of
vocational education and training.
• Career development loans are available to
help people pay for vocational education
or training in Great Britain. Loans of
between £300 and £8,000 are provided
through four major banks, and interest
payments on the loans during training
and for one month after training are
funded by DfEE. The loans help to pay
for courses lasting up to two years. By
the end of March 1999, 117,787 people
had received a career development loan,
and £384 million had been lent.
• From September 1999 DfEE will
introduce the Learning Gateway for 16
and 17 year olds. The Learning
Gateway’s priority group is those in
danger of dropping out of learning
because of a lack of the right skills,
qualifications or attitudes or who have
other personal and social obstacles. Every
young person will be assigned a personal
adviser, who will help clients improve
their self-esteem and motivation, develop
their basic and key skills, and sample jobs
and courses aimed at assisting them to
enter mainstream learning opportunities.
The Government has allocated £37
million for the Learning Gateway to
TECs (see below) which will be
responsible for the delivery of a new ‘life-
skills’ learning option.
• The Small Firms Training Loans
programme helps firms with 50 or fewer
employees to meet a range of training-
related expenses, including training
consultancy. Loans of betw een £500 and
£125,000 are available through eight
major banks, and repayments can be
deferred for up to 12 months.
• The National Training Awards, an
annual competition designed to promote
good training practice rewards those who
have carried out exceptionally effective
training. Awards are made each year to
around 100 employers, training providers
and individuals.
Work-Based Learning for Adults is open to
those aged 25 and over w-ho have been
unemployed for six months or longer. The
aim is to help adults without work move into
sustained employment, including self-
employment, through work-based learning.
Training Bodies
Training and Enterprise Councils
There are 72 Training and Enterprise
Councils/Chambers of Commerce Training
and Enterprise (TECs/CCTEs) in England
and Wales. These are independent companies
with employer-led boards. Their objectives
are to foster local economic development and
stimulate employer investment in skills.
Specifically, they are charged with developing
the quality, effectiveness and relevance to the
local labour market of government-funded
training and business assistance programmes.
In 1999-2000 total DfEE funding to
TECs/CCTEs is £1.4 billion.
The role of TECs has been subject to
review. The White Paper Learning to Succeed
sets out a new framew ork for the planning and
funding of post-16 learning and skills. The
proposals include establishing a national
Learning and Skills Council (see p. 131), which
w ill assume responsibility for government-
funded training and workforce development
from TECs with effect from April 2001.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering both economic development
and environmental improvement. LECs are
152
THE LABOUR MARKET
also responsible for the delivery of the
Government’s national training programmes
in Scotland but, unlike TECs, have no
responsibility for work-related further
education. They run under contract to two
non-departmental public bodies: Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 394).
National Training Organisations
National Training Organisations (NTOs) are
independent, employer-led sector
organisations working strategically with their
sectors and with government across education
and training throughout the United Kingdom.
They aim to ensure that the needs of business
are fully taken into account in developing
education and training policy.
NTOs draw together wide employment
interests, including professional bodies,
education, trade unions and trade associations.
Their outputs include National Occupational
Standards (which provide the basis for NVQs
and SVQs), and Modern Apprenticeship and
National Traineeship frameworks. They also
have a key role in promoting post-16 work-
based learning, including, for example, the
identification of Modern Apprenticeship
places with employers and the use of NVQs
and SVQs.
By June 1999 there were 70 NTOs,
covering 88% of the workforce. It is expected
that by the end of 1999 there will be around
75 NTOs covering more than 95% of the
workforce.
Targets and Standards
The National Learning Targets (see p. 127),
launched in 1998, focus on the Government’s
priorities: a globally competitive economy,
with successful firms operating in a fair and
efficient labour market; and a society where
everybody has an equal chance to realise their
potential.
A Training Standards Council was
established in 1998 to supervise a Training
Inspectorate to raise standards of training
funded through TECs. The Council has a
budget of around £8 million a year.
Investors in People
The Investors in People standard provides a
framework for employers to support their
investment in education and training. It helps
companies to improve their performance by
linking the training and development of all
employees directly to the achievement of
business objectives. By May 1999 nearly
14,500 organisations had achieved recognition
as Investors in People, with a further 21,000
committed to achieving the standard. Over
8 million employees work in organisations
involved in Investors in People, around 34%
of UK employees. Reported benefits include
increased productivity, higher profits, lower
rates of sickness and absenteeism, and
improved morale. The Government is
committed to making Investors in People the
general standard across all UK employers. It is
looking particularly to see many more small
businesses work towards the standard, and
aims to remove barriers to learning by making
Investors in People more accessible to small
organisations.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development, aims to promote
economic development and help people find
work through training and employment
services. It has encouraged the formation of a
sector training council in each main sector to
advise on employers’ training needs and
develop sectoral training strategies. In addition,
the Agency supports company training through
its Company Development Programme and
encourages management development by
providing training programmes and seminars.
In 1998 the Agency launched the New Deal
initiative under the Welfare-to-Work
programme (see p. 154).
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes for
people seeking work. Its Jobskills programme
is designed to raise skill levels—and is linked
to the attainment of NVQs—and to enhance
the employment prospects of school-leavers
and unemployed adults. About 12,000 places
are available in 1999-2000. To combat the
153
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
relatively high level of long-term
unemployment in Northern Ireland, the
Training and Employment Agency is
launching Worktrack, a programme designed
to supplement the New Deal in helping the
long-term unemployed. The Agency also
helps fund Enterprise Ulster (a statutory
organisation which provides employment,
training and work experience).
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people
look for work. According to the Labour Force
Survey in spring 1999, the main job search
methods of the unemployed (on the ILO
basis) were:
• studying ‘situations vacant’ notices in
newspapers or journals (31%), with a
further 8% answering other
advertisements;
• visiting a Jobcentre or employment
agency office (33%);
• personal contacts (10%); and
• direct approaches to employers (10%).
W elfare-to-W ork
The Government’s Welfare-to-Work
programme is a series of measures designed to
tackle youth and long-term unemployment,
promote employability and develop skills, and
move people from welfare into jobs.
A key aspect is the concept of a ‘gateway’,
which gives all people of working age a single
point of access to welfare, and ultimately to
work. The Benefits Agency (see p. 172) and the
Employment Service (see p. 155) are working
together on the gateway process to cut waste
and duplication, giving everyone who has the
potential to work the help they need to find it.
This gateway process is being piloted through a
new service called ONE, where each client will
have his or her own personal adviser. Pilots for
this new service started in June 1999.
The Welfare-to-Work programme is being
funded by a windfall tax on the excess profits
of the privatised utilities (see p. 407). Some
£5.2 billion is being invested in the
programme, in a number of‘New Deals’
including:
• £2.5 billion for young unemployed
people;
• £520 million for the long-term
unemployed;
• £190 million for lone parents;
• £195 million for sick and disabled
people;
• £60 million for partners of the
unemployed;
• £50 million for those aged over 50;
• £40 million for childcare; and
• £1.3 billion for schools.
Young Unemployed
The New Deal for the young unemployed is
available to young people aged 18-24 who
have been unemployed for more than six
months, through four options:
• a job attracting a wage subsidy of £60 a
week, payable to employers for up to six
months;
• a work placement with a voluntary
organisation;
• a six-month work placement with an
Environment Task Force (see p. 315);
and
• for those without basic qualifications, a
place on a full-time education and training
course, which might last for up to one year.
All the options include an element of training.
For each young person the programme begins
with a ‘gateway’ period of careers advice and
intensive help with looking for work, and with
training in the skills needed for the world of
work. By the end of March 1999, some
137,600 young people were participating in
the programme, while 128,700 had completed
it, of whom 44% had entered sustained
unsubsidised jobs.
Over half of those aged 16 or 17 not staying
on in learning are in jobs where there is little
opportunity for them to receive any formal
training. The Government will contribute to
the cost of the young employee’s study or
training at a current estimated average of £800
per employee per year. Employers may apply
to their local TEC for funding support to

THE LABOUR MARKET
enable young employees to exercise their right
to time off for study or training (see p. 152) if,
for whatever reason, mainstream provision
such as a National Traineeship is unavailable
or inappropriate.
Long-term Unemployed
Under the New Deal for the long-term
unemployed, which started in 1998, employers
receive a subsidy of £75 a week for six months
if they employ anyone who has been
unemployed for two years or longer. Since
November 1998 a series of pilot schemes has
been offering 90,000 opportunities for the
long-term unemployed aged 25 and over, with
similar arrangements to the New Deal for the
young unemployed, including a ‘gateway’
period of intensive help with looking for, and
preparing for, work. Some 30,000 of these new
opportunities are available in Northern
Ireland, covering all those who have been
unemployed for over 18 months.
Other Groups
Since October 1998 the New Deal for Lone
Parents has provided job search help, advice and
training for lone parents on income support.
Pilot schemes to help those who are disabled or
on incapacity benefit who want training or work
have also started. By April 1999, 250,000 people
on incapacity benefits (see chapter 12, p. 180)
were covered by such schemes, which are
planned to run nationally from April 2000. In
the 1998 Budget a New Deal for partners of the
unemployed was announced, so that they too
will have the option of help needed to return to
work. This scheme was established on a
nationwide basis in April 1999.
New Deal 50 plus, which is being piloted
from October 1999, enables people over 50
who return to full-time work after six months
or more on benefits to claim a subsidy of £60 a
week for their first year back in work. It is due
to be extended nationally in 2000.
Other Initiatives
Prototype Employment Zones were launched
in 1998 in five areas of high unemployment:
Glasgow, Liverpool, north-west Wales,
Plymouth and south Teesside. From April
2000, new Employment Zones will run in 15
areas of Great Britain. New approaches to
tackling unemployment—including the
delivery of financial help to individual
jobseekers through personal job accounts—
will take place in these areas and will be
delivered by public, private and voluntary
sector organisations which will be selected to
run the zones by open competition. About
£112 million is available to support this
initiative, which aims to help around 48,000
long-term unemployed jobseekers aged 25 and
over. In addition, Rapid Response Units have
been set up in each Employment Service
region, to give advice to any area affected by
large-scale redundancies.
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency of the DfEE.
These include:
• a network of local offices, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into
employment, for example, by training;
and
• a range of special programmes, including
those for people with disabilities.
The Employment Service has a national
network of over 1,000 Jobcentres and a budget
in Great Britain of £2,236 million for
1999-2000, of which £1,068 million is
connected with the New Deals. In 1998-99 it
placed over 1.2 million unemployed people into
jobs and conducted nearly 4 million advisory
interviews to help people find appropriate work
or places on employment and training
programmes. The Employment Service also
has a key role in the delivery of the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work measures,
particularly in relation to the New Deal
programmes and ONE (see p. 154).
155
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
employment advice and training
opportunities. Employment Service advisers
see all jobseekers when a claim is made for
Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 175) to assess
their eligibility and to provide advice about
jobs, training and self-employment
opportunities. To receive the allowance, each
unemployed person has to complete a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out his or
her availability for work, the types of job for
which he or she is looking, and the steps
which, if taken, offer the best chance of
securing work. Jobseekers are required to
attend a job search review each fortnight and
periodic intensive advisory interviews to assess
their situation and see what additional help, if
any, is needed and, if appropriate, to revise the
Jobseeker’s Agreement.
With the introduction of the New Deal
programmes for the young and long-term
unemployed, the range of existing
Employment Service programmes is being
restructured and brought together into a new
package of measures. Programme Centres
have been introduced nationally and will
gradually replace Jobclubs. These offer
flexible and tailored job search help for
unemployed jobseekers. Two programmes,
Restart and Jobplan, have merged under the
name of Jobplan, a mandatory programme to
help jobseekers who have been unemployed
for 12 months or more develop an action plan
to achieve their job goals. This new provision
runs parallel with the New Deal, and many
New Deal participants will benefit from access
to these programmes.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with many
branches. The total value of the market has
been estimated at about £14 billion a year.
The law governing employment agencies is
less restrictive than in many other EU
countries, but agencies must comply with
legislation which establishes a framework of
minimum standards designed to protect
agency users, both workers and hirers. A
review of the regulatory framework is planned,
and the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) issued a consultative document in
spring 1999, containing proposals for
simplifying terms and conditions of
employment, and offering new employees
greater legal protection.
PAY AND CONDITIONS
Earnings
Average gross weekly earnings of full-time
employees on adult rates in Great Britain
whose pay was unaffected by absence were
£384 in April 1998, according to the ONS
New Earnings Survey. Average earnings for
men were £427 and for women £310.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£425) than for manual employees
(£307), with managerial and professional
groups the highest paid.
The sectors with the highest average
weekly earnings are financial services (£510)
and mining and quarrying (£506), while the
sectors with the lowest earnings are hotels and
restaurants, the manufacture of textiles and
textile products, agriculture, hunting and
forestry, and the retail trade.
Minimum Wage
The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set
out the regulatory framework for the national
minimum wage which was introduced in April
1999, at the following levels:
• £3.60 an hour for those aged 22 or above;
• £3.00 an hour for workers aged 18-21;
and
• £3.20 an hour for those aged 22 or over
in the first six months of a new job with a
new employer, and receiving accredited
training.
Workers aged 16 and 17 are exempt from
the national minimum wage. Apprentices aged
18 are also exempt. Apprentices aged 19-25 do
not need to be paid the national minimum
wage for the first 12 months of their
apprenticeship.
Nearly 2 million people are estimated to
have to benefited from the national minimum
wage, including 1.3 million women and
156
THE LABOUR xMARKET
200,000 young people. Other groups who have
benefited include lone parents who work,
ethnic minority workers and homeworkers.
Sectors most affected have been hospitality
(hotels and catering), retailing, cleaning,
hairdressing, social care, footwear and
clothing, and private security.
The rates for the national minimum wage
were based on those recommended to the
Government in a report by the independent
Low Pay Commission, following consultation
with employers, employee groups and other
interested organisations. The Government has
asked the Commission to monitor and evaluate
the impact of the introduction of the national
minimum wage and report back in December
1999. The Commission will look, among other
things, at the effect on pay, employment and
competitiveness in low-paying sectors and
small firms. It will also review the position of
21 year olds to see if they might be covered by
the main £3.60 rate.
Fringe Benefits
Fringe benefits are used by many employers to
provide additional rewards to their employees.
They include schemes to encourage financial
participation by employees in their companies,
pension schemes, private medical insurance,
subsidised meals, company cars and childcare
schemes. About 10.5 million people in Britain
are members of occupational pension schemes
provided by their employers. Company cars
are provided for employees in a wide variety of
circumstances. Around 1.7 million people
have a company car available for private use
and about half of these receive fuel for private
motoring in their car.
By the end of March 1999, 11,233 profit-
related pay schemes, which link part of pay to
changes in a business’s profits, were registered
with the Inland Revenue, covering around 4.1
million people. Many companies have adopted
employee share schemes, where employees
receive free shares or options to buy shares at a
discount from their employer without paying
income tax. A new scheme will be introduced
in 2000, allowing employees to buy shares
from their pre-tax salary and to receive free
shares, with further tax incentives for longer-
term shareholding.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic
working week of between 34 and 40 hours, and
work a five-day week. When overtime is taken
into account, average weekly hours worked by
full-time workers in their main job in the UK
in 1999 were 38.3 hours: 40.2 for men and
34.5 for women. For part-time workers the
average was 15.4 hours. More men than
women work overtime, and those in manual
occupations generally work more overtime
than employees in non-manual jobs.
Both male and female full-time employees
tend to work more hours than in other EU
countries. Hours worked tend to be longest in
agriculture, construction, and transport and
communications, and shortest in most service
industries. Self-employed people work, on
average, longer hours than those in full-time
employment. A significant minority of
employees have flexible working hours or are
engaged in some sort of shift work.
Holiday entitlements have generally been
determined by negotiation. In spring 1999 the
average paid holiday entitlement for full-time
workers was just under five weeks. However,
some employees, such as part-time and
temporary employees, may have much less
holiday entitlement.
Two EC regulations, on working time and
on young workers (in relation to hours of work
of adolescents), came into force in the UK in
1998. They apply to full-time, part-time and
temporary workers, although workers in certain
sectors—including transport, sea fishing, other
work at sea, and doctors in training—are
currently exempt. They provide for:
• a maximum working week of 48 hours
(on average), although individual workers
can choose to work longer;
• a minimum of four weeks’ annual leave;
• minimum daily and weekly rest periods;
and
• a limit for night workers of an average
eight hours’ work in a 24-hour period.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Around a third of employees in Great Britain
in 1998 were in workplaces covered by
157
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
collective bargaining, which is generally more
prevalent in large establishments and in the
public sector. Collective bargaining mainly
concerns pay and working conditions. In
general, negotiations are now conducted more
at a local level, although many large firms
retain a degree of central control over the
bargaining process. There are relatively few
industry-wide agreements; where they do
exist, they are often supplemented by local
agreements in companies or factories (plant
bargaining). The EC’s European Works
Councils Directive, which requires firms with
1,000 or more employees and which operate in
two or more member states to establish
European-level information and consultation
procedures, will be incorporated into UK
legislation by December 1999.
The main findings of the 1998 Workplace
Employee Relations Survey, the largest of its
kind in the world, were published in September
1999. The Survey was sponsored by the DTI,
ACAS (see p. 161), the Economic and Social
Research Council and the Policy Studies
Institute. Among its key findings were:
• workplace flexibility has increased, with
many more workplaces reporting greater
use of contracting out, temporary agency
workers, fixed-term employees and part-
time workers;
• many employers have practices designed
to encourage employee commitment and
promote high performance—for
example, over half of workplaces
operated five or more of 16 commonly
discussed practices, with teamworking,
team briefings and performance
appraisals used in over half of
workplaces;
• fewer workplaces are recognising trade
unions—45%, compared with 53% in
1990;
• over half of employees expressed
themselves as satisfied (47%) or very
satisfied (7%) with their job—only 19%
being dissatisfied (the remaining 27%
were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied);
and
• harmonious employment relations were
widespread, with industrial action being
reported in just 2% of workplaces.
Individual Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Employees with at least two
years of continuous employment with their
employer are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist and their employers cannot offer suitable
alternative work.2
Minimum periods of notice are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to complain
to an employment tribunal (see p. 160),
subject to the general qualifying period. This
was reduced from two years’ continuous
service to one year from June 1999. If the
complaint is upheld, the tribunal may make an
order for re-employment or award
compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination on
grounds of sex or marital status (see p. 119) or
on grounds of colour, race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin (see p. 115), in employment, training
and related matters. In Northern Ireland
discrimination in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is unlawful.
The Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984,
makes it generally unlawful to discriminate
between men and women in pay and other
terms and conditions of employment. Despite
this, there is a continuing pay gender gap.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, disabled people have the right not to be
discriminated against in employment.
Employers with 20 or more employees have a
duty not to discriminate against disabled
employees or applicants.
All pregnant employees have the right to
statutory maternity leave with their non-wage
contractual benefits maintained, and
2 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated
according to a formula based on a person’s age, the
number of years of continuous service and his or her
weekly pay. However, many employers pay more than the
statutory amount.
158
THE LABOUR MARKET
A Disability Rights Commission (see
p. 166) was established in April 1999 to
protect the rights of all disabled people,
both those in work and out of work. It has
powers to investigate cases of
discrimination at work against people with
disabilities, and to ensure employers
comply with the appropriate legal
regulations.
protection against dismissal because of
pregnancy. Statutory maternity pay is payable
by an employer for up to 18 weeks to women
with at least six months’ service with that
employer.
New Rights
The Employment Relations Act 1999 is
introducing a package of family-friendly
employment rights. Key elements are:
• three months’ parental leave after one
year’s service for both women and men,
after having a baby or adopting a child;
• extension of the basic right to maternity
leave to 18 weeks, in line with maternity
pay;
• a reduction to one year of the qualifying
period for additional maternity absence;
• continuation of the employment contract
throughout parental leave and additional
maternity absence;
• a right to take reasonable time off from
work to deal with a family emergency, for
all employees regardless of length of
service; and
• protection against dismissal or detriment
for exercising any of the rights in the
package.
Collective Requirements
Among the legal requirements governing
industrial relations:
• All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non¬
membership of a trade union.
• Trade union employees have the right
not to have union membership
subscriptions deducted from their pay
without their authorisation.
• A trade union must elect every member
of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections
must be held at least every five years and
be carried out by a secret postal ballot
under independent scrutiny.
• If a trade union wishes to set up a
political fund, its members must first
agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an
aim of the union. The union must also
ballot its members every ten years to
maintain the fund. Union members have
a statutory right to opt out of
contributing to the fund.
• For a union to have the benefit of
statutory immunity when organising
industrial action, the action must be
wholly or mainly in contemplation or
furtherance of a trade dispute between
workers and their own employer.
Industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their
own employer (so-called ‘secondary’
action) or involve unlawful forms of
picketing. Before calling for industrial
action, a trade union must obtain the
support of its members in a secret postal
ballot.
New Provisions
Various changes to industrial relations
legislation are being introduced under the
Employment Relations Act 1999. For example,
there are provisions concerning recognition by
employers of trade unions. The new
procedures, which apply to firms with over 20
employees, will encourage the parties to reach
voluntary agreement where possible, but if this
proves impossible a strengthened Central
Arbitration Committee (CAC) will decide on
the issues concerned. In particular, the CAC
will be able to determine the recognition of a
union where a ballot of the workers has shown
159
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
that a majority of those voting and at least 40%
of those eligible to vote are in favour of
recognition. However, where over half the
workforce are already union members,
recognition would be automatic, without the
need for a ballot. Other provisions include:
• a right for employees dismissed for taking
part in lawfully organised official
industrial action to complain of unfair
dismissal to a tribunal;
• a new legal right for employees to be
accompanied by a fellow employee or
trade union representative during
disciplinary and grievance procedures;
• new arrangements on the provision of
information and consultation when
redundancies are planned and on the
protection of employment when a
business is transferred, for example
through a merger or acquisition; and
• making up to £5 million available under a
new Partnership Fund to contribute to
the training of managers and employee
representatives in order to assist and
develop partnerships at work.
It is expected that these provisions will be
implemented, on a phased basis, between 1999
and 2001.
Employment Tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints covering a range
of employment rights, including unfair
dismissal, redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex
and race discrimination. They were formerly
known as industrial tribunals, but were
renamed in 1998 to reflect their new role. This
change took effect under the Employment
Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, which
streamlined tribunal procedures and
encouraged voluntary settlement of disputes
on employment rights. The Act also promoted
a new voluntary arbitration scheme, developed
by ACAS (see p. 161), to settle unfair
dismissal claims, and this is planned to be
introduced towards the end of 1999. These
tribunals received 89,000 applications in
1998-99. Northern Ireland has a separate
tribunal system.
Industrial Disputes
In the past 20 years there has been a
substantial decline in working days lost
through industrial disputes. In 1998 there
were 166 stoppages of work arising from
industrial disputes, and 282,000 working days
were lost as a result. Many of the stoppages
were over pay. The United Kingdom has a
good record in industrial relations; and the
number of days lost per 1,000 employees
compares favourably with the EU average.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments—44 of the UK’s 50
largest companies recognise unions. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and
conditions of employment with employers,
they provide benefits and services such as
educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In recent
years many unions have extended their range
of services for members.
In 1998 there were 7.1 million trade union
members in Great Britain, according to the
Labour Force Survey, 20% fewer than in
1989.3 During this period the proportion of
employees who were union members fell from
39% to 30%. The decline in membership was
particularly noticeable where it has
traditionally been high—among male
employees, manual workers and those in
production industries. Union membership is
now at a similar level among manual and non-
manual employees, having fallen much less in
the latter group. It is now only slightly higher
for men (31%) than for women (28%).
Public administration has the highest
density of union members, around 60% of all
3 There are two main sources of information on trade union
membership: the ONS Labour Force Survey and data
provided by trade unions to the Certification Office.
Differences in coverage result in different estimates for
example, the Certification Office’s figure for trade union
membership at the end of 1997 was 7.8 million, compared
with 7.1 million obtained from the Labour Force Survey in
autumn 1997.
160
THE LABOUR MARKET
employees (54% among female employees).
Sectors with relatively few union members
include agriculture, forestry and fishing,
hotels and restaurants, and wholesaling.
Unison, which operates in the public sector
and has about 1.3 million members, is the
biggest union in Britain. Three other unions
have over 500,000 members:
• the Transport and General Workers
Union;
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union; and
• GMB—a general union with members in
a range of public and private sector
industries.
At the end of 1998 there were 223 trade
unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 19 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
The national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. Its affiliated
membership comprises 77 trade unions, which
together represent some 6.7 million people.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. It deals with all general
questions concerning trade unions, and provides
a forum in which affiliated unions can
collectively determine policy. There are six
TUC regional councils for England and a Wales
Trades Union Council. The annual Congress
meets in September to discuss matters of
concern to trade unionists. A General Council
represents the TUC between annual meetings.
The TUC participates in international
trade union activity, through its affiliation to
the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions and the European Trade Union
Confederation. It also nominates the British
workers’ delegation to the annual International
Labour Conference.
In Scotland there is a separate national
central body, the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, to which UK unions usually affiliate
their Scottish branches. Nearly all trade unions
in Northern Ireland are represented by the
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Most trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of
unions affiliated to the ICTU, while the
majority also belong to unions based in Great
Britain, which are affiliated to the TUC.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in the UK are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters, although
others are also trade associations concerned with
commercial matters in general. With the move
away from national pay bargaining, many
employers’ associations are tending to
concentrate on areas such as supplying
information for bargaining purposes and dealing
with specialist issues. As with some of the larger
trade unions, a number of employers’
associations are increasingly concerned with
legislation and other issues relating to Europe.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an industry
or, for example, with small businesses; most are
national and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there
are local or regional organisations combined into
national federations. At the end of 1998, 106
listed employers’ associations were known to the
Certification Officer; a further 101 unlisted
associations were in operation.
Most national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI—see
p. 399), which represents directly or indirectly
around 250,000 businesses.
ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS
aims to operate through the voluntary
161
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
co-operation of employers, employees and,
where appropriate, their representatives. Its
main functions are collective conciliation;
provision of arbitration and mediation;
advisory mediation services for preventing
disputes and improving industrial relations
through the joint involvement of employers
and employees; and the provision of a public
enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights, and
is developing a new voluntary system for
resolving unfair dismissal claims, to be
introduced in late 1999.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
There has been a long-term decline in injuries
to employees in the UK, partly reflecting a
change in industrial structure away from the
traditional heavy industries, which tend to have
higher risks. In 1997-98 the number of deaths
for employees and the self-employed from
injuries at work was 274, which represented a
fatal injury rate of 1.0 per 100,000 workers.
About 6.5 million working days were lost as a
result of work-related injuries.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must prepare
a written statement of their health and safety
policy and bring it to the attention of their staff.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC)
has responsibility for developing policy on
health and safety at work in Great Britain,
including proposals for new or revised
regulations and approved codes of practice.
Recent work has concentrated on achieving a
simpler and more effective system of health
and safety regulation.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each covering a specific
sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the
primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections are carried out by the Field
Operations Directorate, which includes the
Factory, Agricultural and Quarries
inspectorates and the regional staff of the
Employment Medical Advisory Service.
The HSE’s Directorate of Science and
Technology provides technical advice on
industrial health and safety matters. The
Health and Safety Laboratory provides
scientific and medical support and testing
services, and carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health and
safety legislation is enforced by inspectors
appointed by local authorities, working under
guidance from the HSE. Some other official
bodies work under agency agreement with the
HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of the Northern
Ireland health and safety legislation are
broadly similar to those for Great Britain.
They are enforced mainly by the Department
of Economic Development and the
Department of Agriculture through their
health and safety inspectorates, although the
district councils have an enforcement role
similar to that of local authorities in Great
Britain. The Health and Safety Agency,
roughly corresponding to the HSC but
without its policy-making powers, and an
Employment Medical Advisory Service were
replaced by a new government body, the
Health and Safety Executive for Northern
Ireland, in April 1999.

Local authority personal social services and voluntary organisations provide
help and advice to many members of the community elderly, physically
disabled and mentally ill people, those with learning disabilities, and children
in need of care. The Government has set out its policies for these areas in the
White Paper Modernising Social Services and the policy statement Modernising
Mental Health Services. Some of the proposals will need primary legislation
which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.
The Government is also undertaking a far-reaching overhaul of the social
security system. This is based on the key objectives of promoting incentives to
work, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthening community
and family life. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill was introduced in
Parliament in February 1999.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help the elderly, the
disabled, children and young people, those
with mental illness or learning disabilities,
their families and carers. Major services
include skilled residential and day care, help
for people confined to their homes, and
various forms of social work. Services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and
overseeing standards.
The statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary bodies.
Much of the care given to elderly and
disabled people is provided by families and
self-help groups. One in eight adults gives
informal care and one in six homes has a carer.
There are about 6 million informal carers in
the UK; 58% are women and 42% are men.
Carers who provide (or intend to provide)
substantial care on a regular basis have the
right, on request, to an assessment of their
own needs.
A National Carers Strategy—Caring about
Carers—was published in February 1999.
This clarifies the Government’s objectives for
carers and sets out proposals for change. It
covers in particular carers’ health, breaks from
caring, support in the community, and help so
that they can stay in work.
164
SOCIAL PROTECTION
Demand for personal social services is
rising because of the increasing number of
elderly people, who, along with disabled and
mentally ill people and those with learning
disabilities, have the opportunity to lead more
independent lives in the community if they
receive suitable support and facilities.
At the end of 1998, the Government
published a White Paper—Modernising Social
Services: Promoting Independence, Improving
Protection, Raising Standards—paving the way for
radical improvements in the quality, reliability
and cost-effectiveness of social services.
Management Reforms
The White Paper signalled the start of reforms
in the monitoring of social services
performance in England. It set out clear
national objectives and priorities together with
new systems for monitoring how well services
are provided.
The main elements are:
• local authorities to set authority-wide
objectives and performance measures;
• local authorities to carry out performance
reviews of all their services over a five-
year cycle, in consultation with local
taxpayers, service users and the wider
business community;
• a new performance assessment
framework for social services;
• performance plans to identify targets for
annual improvements against locally
defined indicators;
• Social Service Inspectorate regional
offices to carry out annual reviews of the
social services aspects of the performance
plans; and
• independent inspection to continue to be
undertaken by the Social Services
Inspectorate, both of individual
authorities and on thematic issues across
sample authorities.
Elderly People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. The proportion of
the population aged 75 and over rose from 4%

in 1961 to 7% in 1997. However, the number
of elderly people in the population is expected
to grow less quickly in the next decade than it
has in the previous one.
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services, as well
as day centres, lunch clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a range of equipment is available
for people with poor hearing or eyesight or
people with physical disabilities. Alarm
systems help elderly people obtain assistance
in an emergency. In some areas ‘good
neighbour’ and visiting services are arranged
by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Elderly people who live in
residential care homes or nursing homes are
subject to means-test charging. Those who
cannot afford to pay have their costs met by
the State. Local authorities in England,
Scotland and Wales may also levy charges for
domiciliary services.
The most marked trend in residential care
provision over recent years has been the
continuing increase in the number of places
provided in the private and voluntary sectors
and the corresponding fall in the number
provided in local authorities’ own homes.
165
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
As part of their responsibility for social
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people (‘sheltered
accommodation’); some of these developments
have resident wardens. Housing associations
and private builders also build such
accommodation. Many local authorities
provide free or subsidised travel for elderly
people within their areas.
A Royal Commission on the funding of long¬
term care for elderly people in the UK was set
up in 1997. The Commission’s report—With
Respect to Old Age: Long-Term Care—Rights
and Responsibilities—was published in March
1999. The Government is considering its
recommendations, which include splitting the
costs of long-term care between living costs,
housing costs and personal care, and
establishing a National Care Commission.
Disabled People
About 8.6 million disabled adults live in
private households. Over the past ten years
there has been increasing emphasis on
rehabilitation and on the provision of day,
domiciliary and respite support services to
enable disabled people to live independently
in the community wherever possible.
Local authority social services departments
help with social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
publicise services. These may include advice on
personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as on occupational,
educational, social and recreational facilities,
either at day centres or elsewhere. Other
services provided may include adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, stairlifts
and ground-floor toilets), the delivery of cooked
meals, and help with personal care at home.
Local authorities and voluntary organisations
may provide severely disabled people with
residential accommodation or temporary
facilities to allow their carers relief from their
duties. Special housing may be available for
those able to look after themselves.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for disabled people on public transport,
and they are encouraged to provide special
means of access to public buildings.
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995:
• provides a right for disabled people not
to be discriminated against in
employment, and places a duty on
employers with 15 or more staff to
consider reasonable adjustments to the
terms on which they offer employment
where these would help to overcome the
practical effects of a disability; and
• provides a right of access to goods and
services which makes it unlawful to
refuse to serve a disabled person and may
require service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to their services
to make them more accessible.
The National Disability Council and the
Northern Ireland Disability Council advise
the Government on eliminating discrimination
against disabled people. A new Disability
Rights Commission was established under the
Disability Rights Commission Act 1999. It is
expected to be in place by spring 2000. Its
main aims will be to work towards the
elimination of discrimination against disabled
people; promote equal opportunities for
disabled people; encourage good practice; and
advise the Government on the operation of the
Disability Discrimination Act. In Northern
Ireland it is intended that disabled people will
have the same rights through the Equality
Commission (see p. 18) as disabled people in
the rest of the UK.
In 1997 the Government transferred
responsibility for disability issues from the
Department of Social Security to the
Department for Education and Employment.
This is intended to signal a move away from
treating disabled people merely as recipients of
benefits towards a culture which will value their
role in society as people willing and able to take
advantage of education, training and employment
opportunities. The New Deal for Disabled
People, part of the Government’s Welfare-to-
Work programme (see p. 154), is designed to
help disabled people find and keep work.
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Government encourages the development
of local services for people with learning
166
SOCIAL PROTECTION
disabilities and their families through co¬
operation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services,
and voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with
learning disabilities. They provide or arrange
short-term care, support for families in their
own homes, residential accommodation and
support for various types of activity outside
the home. The main aims are to ensure that as
far as possible people with learning disabilities
can lead full lives in their communities and are
admitted to hospital only when it is necessary
on health grounds. People with learning
disabilities form the largest group for local
authority-funded day centre places and the
second largest group in residential care.
The National Health Service (NHS)
provides* specialist services when the ordinary
primary care services cannot meet healthcare
needs. Residential care is provided for those
with severe or profound disabilities whose
needs can only effectively be met by the NHS.
People with a Mental Illness
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental illnesses should have access to all
the services they need as locally as possible. A
cornerstone of community care policy for
mentally ill people is the Care Programme
Approach. Under this, each patient should
receive an assessment and a care plan, have a
key worker appointed to keep in touch with
him or her, and be given regular reviews. The
Care Programme Approach is subject to audit,
enabling health authorities (health boards in
Scotland) to identify any problems with the
quality of its implementation. The separate
Welsh Mental Health Strategy employs many
of the same broad principles in delivering
services in Wales. In Scotland, each health
board works with its local authority care
partners, users of mental health services and
their carers to develop local joint strategies to
provide local and comprehensive mental
health services.
While the total number of places for
mentally ill people in the large hospitals has
continued to fall, the provision of alternative
places has increased in smaller NHS hospitals,
local authority accommodation and private
and voluntary sector homes.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after-care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital. In England and Wales the Mental
Health Act Commission (in Scotland the
Mental Welfare Commission and in Northern
Ireland the Mental Health Commission)
provides important safeguards for patients to
ensure that the law is used appropriately.
A grant of £116.5 million for 1999-2000 to
local authorities in England is designed to
encourage them to increase the level of social
care available to mentally ill patients,
including those with dementia who need
specialist psychiatric care in the community.
Supervision registers for discharged patients
most at risk are maintained by the providers of
services for mentally ill people and allow
hospital staff to keep track of them.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness (such as MIND, SANE and the
Scottish Association for Mental Health), or
learning disabilities (such as MENCAP or its
Scottish equivalent ENABLE), and they play
an important role in providing services for
both groups of people. Central Government
provides funding to many similar voluntary
bodies.
In December 1998 the Government
published a policy statement for England and
Wales—Modernising Mental Health Services:
Safe, Sound and Supportive—setting out its
new vision for the future delivery of both
health and social care for people with mental
health problems. One of its primary aims is to
reduce nationally the emergency psychiatric
readmission of patients discharged from
hospital by 2% by 2002 from the 1997-98
level of 14.3%. In Scotland, a committee has
been established to undertake a review of
mental health legislation. It is due to report in
summer 2000.
167
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Help to Families
Local authorities must safeguard the welfare of
any child in need, and promote the upbringing
of such children by their families, by providing
a range and level of services appropriate to those
children’s needs. These services can include
advice, guidance, counselling, help in the home,
or family centres, and can be provided for the
family of the child in need or any member of the
family, if this will safeguard the child’s welfare.
Local authorities can provide these services
directly or arrange for them to be provided by,
for example, a voluntary organisation. They are
also required to publicise the help available to
families in need. Many local authorities or
specialist voluntary organisations run refuges
for women, often with young children, whose
home conditions have become intolerable,
through, for example, domestic violence. The
refuges provide short-term accommodation and
support while attempts are made to relieve the
women’s problems.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities are provided for young
children by childminders, voluntary agencies,
private nurseries and local authorities. In
allocating places, where local authorities have
their own provision, priority is given to
children with special social, learning or health
needs. Local authorities currently register and
inspect childminders, playgroups and day
nurseries but the Government intends to set
up a new regulatory body under the Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) to
undertake all nursery education and day care
inspections in the future.
Child Protection
Child protection is the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Area child protection committees determine
how the different agencies should co-operate
to help protect children from abuse and
neglect in that area.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children who have no parent
or guardian, who have been abandoned, or
whose parents are unable to provide for them.
In England and Wales a child may be brought
before a family proceedings court if he or she is
neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral
danger, beyond the control of parents, or not
attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Certain pre-conditions have to be
satisfied to justify an order. These are that the
children are suffering or are likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of reasonable
parental care or because they are beyond
parental control. However, an order is made
only if the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the children’s well-being
and be in their best interests. In court
proceedings children are entitled to separate legal
representation and the right to have a guardian to
protect their interests. All courts have to treat the
welfare of children as the paramount
consideration when reaching any decision about
their upbringing. There is a general principle
that, wherever possible, children should remain
at home with their families.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a Children’s Hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker, but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements
are reviewed at least once a year until ended
by a Children’s Hearing.
The Government has set up the Quality
Protects programme to transform standards of
care offered to looked-after children and others
needing social services’ support. This childcare
management strategy is supported by a new
special grant of £375 million over the next
three years, payments being subject to the
preparation and achievement of satisfactory
action plans by each local authority.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
Local authorities have a duty to ensure that
the welfare of children being looked after away
168
SOCIAL PROTECTION
from home is properly safeguarded as regards
their health, education, contact with their
families and general quality of life. When
appropriate, children in care are placed with
foster parents, who receive payments to cover the
child’s living costs. Alternatively, the child may
be placed in residential care. Children’s homes
may be provided by local authorities, voluntary
organisations or private companies or individuals.
Except for small, private, unregistered children’s
homes accommodating three or fewer children,
they are formally inspected.
Parents of children in care retain their
parental responsibilities but act as far as
possible as partners with the authority. Local
authorities are required to produce a plan for
the future of each child in their care and to
prepare a child for leaving their care and to
continue to advise him or her up to the age of
21; they are also required to have a complaints
procedure with an independent element to
cover children in their care.
In response to a 1997 report (People Like Us:
Review of the Safeguards for Children Living
Away from Home), which was commissioned
after several serious cases of abuse of children in
care, the Government announced plans for a
range of measures to be taken to improve the
lives of children living away from home. In
addition to the Quality Protects programme (see
p. 168), the Government will establish new
independent regulatory arrangements for
children’s homes, fostering agencies and
boarding schools. It will also set up a new
criminal records agency to improve and widen
access to police checks on people intending to
work with children and other vulnerable groups.
Recent Trends
The number of children looked after by local
authorities in England has declined since 1992
and the proportion of foster placements has
gradually risen. The number of children in local
authority day care has declined sharply since
1994. In March 1998, 30,000 children in England
and Wales were on child protection registers.
Adoption
Local authority social services departments are
required by law to provide an adoption
service, either directly or by arrangement with
approved voluntary adoption societies. Under
adoption law it is illegal to receive an unrelated
child for adoption through an unapproved third
party. The Registrars-General keep
confidential registers of adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of
their original birth record on reaching the age
of 18 (or 16 if adopted in Scotland), and
counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted. In Scotland a
similar service is provided through BirthLink.
The number of children, healthy babies in
particular, who are available for adoption is far
exceeded by those people wishing to adopt. In
recent years fewer than 7,000 children have
been adopted annually.
Finance
In 1996-97, gross expenditure in England on
personal social services was £9.3 billion. Local
authorities’ expenditure on services for older
people and children accounted for nearly
three-quarters of this (see pie chart on p. 170).
The largest items of expenditure were for
residential care (47%) and day care (38%).
Social Care Workforce
The effective working of social care depends
on the skills of the social care workforce of
almost 1 million people. Of these, there are
about 50,000 professionally qualified social
workers who are employed mainly by social
services departments of local authorities,
including those social workers in the NHS.
Most of the workforce are not social workers
and are employed in the independent sector.
Action is being taken to raise the training
and qualification levels for the whole
workforce. The national training organisation
for social care will be producing a training
strategy for England by the autumn of 1999
analysing workforce and training needs and
identifying any skills gaps.

The Government is also considering the
outcome of a review of professional social
work training which has looked at
fundamental issues such as the academic level
and length of training period, student support
and regulation of training. Any programme of
development arising from the review will be
for the benefit of the General Social Care
Council (GSCC) when it is established. The
present Central Council for Education and
Training in Social Work (CCETSW) will then
be abolished. The GSCC will also set and
promote standards of conduct and practice for
all social care workers.
Social Security
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from
disablement.
Social security is the largest single area of
government spending. In each year from
1993-94 to 1998-99 spending on social
security benefits in Great Britain represented
about 30% of total government expenditure.
! At the beginning of the 20th century a
; system of social protection and preventive j
; healthcare in Britain was beginning to
! emerge, though the level and conditions of >
! care available were generally very poor. j
In 1905, the Minority Report of the
; Royal Commission on the Poor Laws
; pointed out the differences in standards of j
! healthcare services provided across the !
i country and urged the Government to take ;
; action on the matter. It responded with
i pensions for the elderly and benefits for ;
! the unemployed.
i The 1908 Old Age Pensions Act granted
; non-contributory, means-tested
j pensions—paid from national funds—to ;
! people who had reached the age of 70 and I
; whose annual income was under £31.
! Pensioners received sums ranging from
! one shilling to five shillings (5p to 25p) a j
! week.
i The National Insurance Act 1911
| ensured that workers at the bottom end of ;
; the wage scale received free treatment
! from their doctor, but did little to improve j
! the situation for the rest of the population.
| It was, however, the first step in the
! Government’s recognition that people on |
I low incomes who were sick or without a i
; job needed centrally funded help to
| improve the quality of their lives. The Act |
! provided insurance for all manual workers ;
! between the ages of 16 and 70 earning no !
; more than £160 a year. Other groups such j
; as the self-employed and those who
! already had health insurance were not
1 covered. The basic weekly sickness benefit
! was 10 shillings (50p) for men and seven !
; shillings and sixpence (371/2p) for women. ;
At 1998-99 prices, spending grew from £93.2
billion to £95.8 billion over this five-year
period, representing a growth rate of about
0.6% a year on average, compared with growth
in the economy as a whole of about 3% a year.
In 1993-94, benefit expenditure in Great
Britain represented nearly 13% of UK gross
domestic product (GDP). Since then spending
has fallen as a percentage of GDP, and in
1998-99, it accounted for slightly over 11%.

There are many reasons for this high level
of expenditure, not least the increasing
number and range of benefits, as social
security has expanded to cover both a wider
range of contingencies and the changing shape
and expectations of society.
MODERNISING THE SYSTEM
Welfare Reform
The Green Paper New Ambitions for our
Country, published in 1998, set out the
framework for welfare reform, based on eight
principles, together with a number of
measures of success for each principle, to
gauge progress over the next ten to 20 years.
The central aim was to replace a cycle of
dependency and insecurity with an ethic of
work and savings. Following wide
consultation, the Government introduced the
Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill in February
1999. The main measures in the Bill are:
• a single gateway to the benefit system for
those of working age;
• the introduction of the new stakeholder
pension schemes (see p. 175);
• pension sharing for divorced couples (see
p. 175);
• modernised benefits for widows and
widowers; and
• modernising the benefits structure for
people with disabilities or long-term
illness.
When enacted, the legislation should tackle
three key problems: inequality and social
exclusion (see p. 117), especially among
children and pensioners; barriers to paid work,
including financial disincentives; and fraud
which is taking money out of the system and
away from genuine claimants.
Fighting Fraud
Measures to improve the prevention and
detection of fraud in the social security system
include:
• The Social Security Administration
(Fraud) Act 1997, which has powers to
deal with Housing Benefit fraud,
including landlord fraud. The Act,
among other measures:
— has created a new criminal offence
of obtaining benefit by false
representation;
— permits certain government
departments and local authorities to
share data with each other;
— allows local authorities to demand
information from certain landlords
about their property holdings;
— enables local authority investigators
to gain entry to business premises
and to examine business records;
and
— offers people who commit benefit
fraud the choice of paying a
financial penalty instead of facing
prosecution.
• The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate, which
came into operation in 1997, examines
and reports on standards of performance
in the administration of all social security
benefits, in particular anti-fraud work,
within the Department of Social
Security’s agencies and local authorities.
It also carries out work for the Social
Security Agency in Northern Ireland.
The Government recognises the difficulties
of measuring a covert activity such as fraud,
171
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
but latest estimates of benefit fraud in Great
Britain indicate that around £2 billion is lost
each year through confirmed fraud and a
further £3 billion in cases where fraud has
probably taken place but no claimant has been
proved guilty.
ADMINISTRATION
In April 1999 the Contributions Agency
merged with the Inland Revenue (see p. 406)
to provide customers with a single point of
contact for tax and National Insurance (NI)
matters. The remaining executive agencies of
the Department of Social Security (DSS)
handle the administration of social security in
Great Britain, together employing a total of
around 77,000 staff:
• the Benefits Agency (BA) administers
and pays the majority of benefits;
• the Child Support Agency (CSA)
assesses and collects maintenance
payments for children (see p. 177);
• the Information Technology Services
Agency maintains the computer system
which supports the administration of
social security; and
• the War Pensions Agency delivers
services to war pensioners.
In Great Britain the Housing and Council
Tax Benefit schemes are administered by local
authorities. In Northern Ireland, social security
benefits are administered by the Social Security
Agency and the National Insurance
Contributions Scheme by the Inland Revenue.
The Housing Benefit scheme is administered
by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and the Rate Collection Agency; council tax
does not apply in Northern Ireland, where
domestic ‘rates’ are still collected.
Advice about Benefits
The DSS produces a range of leaflets and
posters and a website providing general
information on entitlement and liability. The
leaflets and posters are available in English
and a number of other languages. The Benefit
Enquiry Line is a confidential telephone
service offering general advice on benefits to
people with disabilities and their carers. The
number is: 0800 88 22 00.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance (NI)
benefits such as Retirement Pension,
Incapacity Benefit, contributory Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Maternity Allowance and Widow’s
Benefit, is dependent upon the payment of
contributions. Major reforms to NI
contributions, designed to improve incentives
to work, encourage job creation and cut down
on bureaucracy, were introduced from April
1999. Among other things, the amount an
employee can earn before employer NI
contributions are charged is being aligned with
the personal allowance for income tax (see
p. 405). There are five classes of contributions.
The rates given below are effective from
April 1999 to April 2000:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings
below £66 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
at or above a lower earnings limit of £66
a week in non-contracted out
employment are at the rate of 10% up to
the upper earnings limit of £500 a week.
Employers’ contributions at the rate of
12.2% are subject to the same threshold.
• Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£6.55 a week. The self-employed may
claim exemption from Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected
to be below £3,770 for the 1999-2000 tax
year. Self-employed people are not
eligible for unemployment and industrial
injuries benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £6.45 a week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
172
SOCIAL PROTECTION
(£7,530 a year), and up to a set upper limit
(£26,000 a year) in addition to their Class
2 contribution. Class 4 contributions are
payable at the rate of 6%.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
Social security benefits can be grouped into
three types:
• means-tested, available to people whose
income and savings are below certain
levels;
• contributory, paid to people who have
made the required contributions to the
National Insurance Fund,1 from which
benefits are paid; and
• benefits which are neither means-
tested nor contributory (mainly paid
to cover extra costs, for example of
disability, or paid universally, for
example Child Benefit).
General taxation provides over half the
income for the social security programme,
employers’ NI contributions around a quarter
and employees’ NI contributions about a fifth.
Appeals about claims are decided by
independent tribunals, but a new system of
informing customers of decisions on benefits
and handling appeals—the Decision-Making
and Appeals (DMA) Programme—is being
phased in from June 1999 (see p. 178).
For most contributory benefits there are
two conditions. First, before benefit can be
paid at all, a certain number of contributions
must have been paid. Second, the full rate of
benefit cannot be paid unless contributions
have been paid or credited to a specific level
over a set period. A reduced rate of benefit is
payable dependent on the level of
1 The National Insurance Fund is a statutory fund into
which all NI contributions payable by employers,
employees and self-employed people are deposited, and
from which contributory benefits and their administration
costs are paid.

contributions paid or credited. For example, a
great many of those receiving retirement
pensions and widows’ benefits receive a
percentage-based rate of benefit. Benefits are
increased annually in line with percentage
increases in retail prices. The main benefits
(payable weekly) are summarised on pp.
173-82. Rates given are those effective
from April 1999 until April 2000.
Retirement
A state Retirement Pension is a taxable
weekly benefit payable, if the contribution
conditions have been met, to women at the age
of 60 and men at the age of 65. Legislation was
introduced in 1995 to equalise the state
pension age for men and women at 65. The
change will be phased in over ten years,
starting from April 2010. Women born before
6 April 1950 will not be affected; their pension
age will remain at 60. The new pension age of
65 will apply to women born on or after 6
April 1955. Pension age for women born
between these dates will move up gradually
from 60 to 65.

The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £66.75 for a single
person and £106.70 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension (sometimes called ‘SERFS’—state
earnings-related pension). Pensioners may
have unlimited earnings without affecting
their pensions. Those who have put off their
retirement during the five years after state
pension age may earn extra pension.
A. non-contributory retirement pension of
£39.95 a week is payable to people aged 80 or
over who have lived in Britain for at least ten
years since reaching the age of 60, and who
have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them
enough to live on may be entitled to Income
Support (see p. 176).
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are
174
SOCIAL PROTECTION
limited while they are looking after a child or a
sick or disabled person. Men and women may
receive the same basic pension, provided they
have paid full-rate NI contributions when
working. The earnings-related pension
scheme will eventually be calculated as 20%
rather than 25% of earnings, to be phased in
over ten years from 1999. However, the
pensions of people retiring in the 20th century
will be unaffected.
As part of its plan to improve the income of
women in retirement, the Government has
included provisions in the Welfare Reform
and Pensions Bill to enable the courts to
divide pension rights equally between
divorcing couples. The arrangements are
expected to be in force from April 2000.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state scheme for the additional
earnings-related pension and provide their
own occupational pension instead. Their
pension must be at least as good as the state
additional pension. Joining an employer’s
contracted-out scheme is voluntary: employers
are not free to contract out employees from
the earnings-related pension scheme without
the employees’ consent. The State remains
responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes have over
9 million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or do not
want to transfer their pension rights, are now
offered some protection against inflation.
Workers leaving a scheme have the right to a
fair transfer value. The trustees or managers
of pension schemes have to provide full
information about their schemes. Average
weekly income from an occupational pension
is around £50 for men and £30 for women.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-related
pension scheme, people are entitled to choose
a personal pension available from a bank,
building society, insurance company or other
financial institution. Occupational schemes
must provide equal treatment between men
and women and make personal pensions
flexible and attractive to a broad age range.
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints of maladministration against
occupational and personal pension schemes
and adjudicates on disputes of fact or law. A
pensions registry helps people trace lost
benefits.
Pensions Review
In 1997 the Government announced a review
of pensions. Its long-term objective is to
ensure that everyone has the opportunity to
build up an adequate pension to guarantee
security in retirement. The review has looked
at the central areas of insecurity for elderly
people, including all aspects of state provision,
and the introduction of a new State Second
Pension to replace SERFS from 2002 (see
p. 174).
The Government also wants to support and
strengthen the framework for occupational
pensions. A consultation document was
published in 1997 containing proposals on
stakeholder pensions for those who do not
have access to an employer’s occupational
pension scheme and for whom a personal
pension may not be suitable. Stakeholder
pensions will be introduced in April 2001
under the provisions of the Welfare Reform
and Pensions Bill currently before Parliament.
Plans are also being developed to make the
State Second Pension available to carers and
others with domestic responsibilities who are
unable to contribute to a second pension in
their own right.
Unemployment
Jobseeker’s Allowance
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
people needing financial support because of
unemployment. Claimants must be capable of,
and available for, work, and actively seeking it.
They must normally be aged at least 18 years
and under pension age. JSA can be either
contribution-based or income-based:
• Contribution-basedjfSA\ those who have
paid enough NI contributions are entitled
to a personal JSA for up to six months
(£51.40 a week for a person aged 25 or
175
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
over), regardless of any savings or
partner’s income.
• Income-based JSA: those on a low income
are entitled to an income-based JSA,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-
related personal allowance (£51.40 a
week for a person aged 25 or over),
allowances for dependent children and
premium payments for those with extra
expenses, for example, disabled children.
Benefit is paid at rates determined by family
circumstances on a basis similar to Income
Support (see below).
Back to Work Bonus
Recipients of JSA (see above) and people aged
under 60 who receive Income Support can
benefit from a Back to Work Bonus. This is
intended to increase incentives to take up or
keep part-time work, and encourage people to
move off benefit and into employment. Those
who have been unemployed for three months
or more and are working part-time may keep
the first £5 of their earnings (£10 for couples;
£15 for lone parents, disabled people and
some people in special occupations) in any
week in which they work while still receiving
benefit. An amount equal to half of any
earnings above that level counts towards the
build-up of a bonus amount. When the
unemployed person moves off JSA because of
an increase in earnings or hours of work, he or
she will be able to claim a tax-free lump sum
of up to £1,000. The part-time (up to 24
hours a week) earnings of a partner can also
contribute towards building up a Back to
Work Bonus, which can be paid if the couple
leave benefit as a result of an increase in the
partner’s earnings or hours of work.
Income Support
Income Support is payable to certain people
aged 16 or over who are not required to be
available for work, and whose income and
savings are below certain set levels. They
include lone parents, pensioners, carers and
long-term sick and disabled people. Income
Support is made up of: a personal allowance
based on age and on whether the claimant is
single, a lone parent or has a partner; age-
related allowances for dependent children and
additional sums known as premiums; and
housing costs. From this total amount other
income, including some other social security
benefits, is deducted.
Income Support is not payable if savings
exceed £8,000. Savings between £3,000 and
£8,000 will reduce the amount received. For
people living permanently in residential care
or a nursing home, the allowance is not
payable if savings exceed £16,000; and savings
between £10,000 and £16,000 will affect the
amount received.
Families
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £66 a week. She will
receive 90% of her average weekly earnings
for the first six weeks and a rate of £59.55 a
week for the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, or have recently changed jobs
or left their job, may qualify for a weekly
Maternity Allowance, which is payable for
up to 18 weeks. This amounts to £59.55 a
week for employees and £51.70 a week for the
self-employed and those not in work. All
pregnant employees have the right to take 14
weeks’ maternity leave.
An additional payment of £100 from the
Social Fund (see p. 179) may be made if the
mother or her partner receive Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance (Working Families’ Fax
Credit or Disabled Person’s Tax Credit from
October 1999—see p. 178). It is also available
if a baby is adopted.
The main social security benefit for
children is Child Benefit. 1 his is a tax-free,
non-contributory payment of £14.40 a week
for the eldest qualifying child of a couple, and

£9.60 for each other child. A higher rate of
£17.10 is payable for the eldest qualifying
child of a person bringing up a child on his or
her own, whether the person is the child’s
parent or not. Child Benefit is payable for
children up to the age of 16, and for those up
to 19 who continue in full-time non-advanced
education. It is generally not payable to people
whose entry into the UK is subject to
immigration control.
People claiming Child Benefit for an
orphaned child they have taken into their
family may be entitled to Guardian’s
Allowance. This is a tax-free non¬
contributory benefit of £7.30 a week for the
oldest child and £11.35 for each other child
who qualifies. In certain circumstances
Guardian’s Allowance can be paid when only
one parent is dead.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1 million lone parents in the UK
bring up 1.7 million children in households
where no one is working. The Child Support
Agency (CSA) and its counterpart in
Northern Ireland are responsible for assessing
child maintenance and, where requested by
either parent, collecting and enforcing child
maintenance payments from, and for tracing,
absent parents.
If any person is living with and caring for a
child, and one, or both, of the child’s parents
are living elsewhere in the UK, he or she may
apply to have child support maintenance
assessed and collected by the CSA (or its
Northern Ireland counterpart). If that person
or their present partner claims Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance, they may be required to
apply for child support maintenance if asked
to do so by the CSA (or its Northern Ireland
counterpart).
Assessments for child support maintenance
are made using a formula which takes into
account each parent’s income and makes
allowance for essential outgoings. (A system of
departures from the formula allows the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied in
a small number of cases.) A child maintenance
bonus worth up to £1,000 may be payable to
parents living with and caring for a child who
have been in receipt of Income Support or
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and in
receipt of child maintenance when they leave
benefit for work.
The Green Paper Children First: A New
Approach to Child Support was published in
1998, setting out the Government’s proposals
for a new local, child support scheme based on
a radically simpler method of assessment. It
also proposed that parents living with and

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Decision-Making and Appeals (DMA)
Programme
A new cross-departmental initiative between
the Benefits Agency and the Child Support
Agency is being introduced in stages from
June 1999. Customers of both agencies
should benefit through simpler, clearer
decisions and improved handling of appeals.
The main changes are:
• A single decision-maker—BA and CSA
customers have their decisions made by
one official, rather than several having
an interest in only a certain aspect of
the case.
• Clearer notifications—customers get the
information they need on the amount of
benefit they are eligible for, or level of
child support maintenance payable, in a
single notification.
• Better customer service—customers are
actively encouraged to telephone or
visit BA local offices if they do not
understand their notification or are
unhappy with their decision.
caring for a child who are on Income Support
should be allowed to keep up to £10 a week of
any maintenance paid for their children.
Although the new scheme is unlikely to be
introduced before 2001, many improvements
are already under way or planned. These
include: a simpler and more efficient process
for making and appealing decisions (see
above); and reorganisation of the CSA to
centralise processing work and free local staff
to concentrate on meeting clients face to face.
Childcare Costs
Families claiming Family Credit, Disability
Working Allowance, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit, and who pay for childcare
for children aged under 12, can have up to £60
a week in formal childcare costs offset against
their earnings when their benefit entitlement is
worked out. From October 1999 the maximum
childcare disregards will be increased from a
maximum of £60 to £100 a week for families
where there is one child, and to £150 for
families with two or more children.
• Improved dispute resolution—a more
flexible system for resolving disputes
enables customers to ask the BA and
CSA to look again at their decision, and
the agencies have improved powers to
correct a decision quickly if it is wrong.
• Focused appeals submissions—if, after
looking at it again, the decision stands
and the customer wishes to appeal, the
next stage is a clearly presented appeal
which concentrates solely on those
issues under dispute.
• Unified appeal tribunals—appeals are
heard by a unified appeal tribunal,
replacing five separate bodies currently
specialising in specific areas of BA and
CSA work.
• A new appeals service—from April 2000,
a new executive agency, The Appeals
Service (TAS), will be responsible for
the administration of appeals across the
whole range of DSS business, replacing
the Independent Tribunal Service.
As part of its Welfare-to-Work programme
(see chapter 11), the Government has
implemented a national childcare strategy that
will help lone mothers to get work instead of
being dependent on benefits (see p. 119).
Family Credit/Working Families’ Tax Credit
Family Credit, which is being replaced by the
new Working Families’ Tax Credit (WFTC)
from October 1999, is a tax-free benefit
payable to low-income working families with
children. It is payable to couples or lone
parents. One parent must work for at least 16
hours a week. The amount payable depends
on a family’s net weekly income; the number
and ages of the children in the family; the
amount of certain childcare charges paid; and
the number of hours worked.
A maximum amount of Family Credit
(consisting of an adult credit, plus a credit for
each child varying with age, and an extra
credit if one parent works for at least 30 hours
a week), is payable if the family’s net weekly
income is less than £80.65. If income is more
178
SOCIAL PROTECTION
than £80.65, 70 pence of every £1 of the excess
is deducted from the maximum payable.
Child Benefit and the first £15 of any child
maintenance payment are not counted as
income. Certain childcare charges can be
offset against earnings before entitlement to
Family Credit is calculated. The capital limit
for Income Support (see p. 176) also applies to
Family Credit.
By introducing a higher income threshold
before the new WFTC is withdrawn and
withdrawing it at a rate of 55% rather than
70% as with Family Credit, WFTC is
designed to improve work incentives and to
encourage people to move into and remain in
employment. It is central to the Government’s
major programme of tax and benefit reform,
representing a step towards greater integration
of the tax and benefits systems. At the same
time, a new childcare tax credit, forming part
of WFTC, will be introduced. It will be worth
70% of eligible childcare costs up to £100 a
week for families with one child and £150 for
families with two or more children, thus
giving greater help with childcare costs.
Social Fund
Payments, in the form of loans or grants, may
be available to people on low incomes to help
with expenses which are difficult to pay for
out of regular income. There are two kinds.
Discretionary payments are:
• budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses;
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, to ease exceptional pressure
on families, to set up home as part of a
planned resettlement programme and to
meet certain travel expenses; and
• crisis loans to help people in an
emergency or as a result of a disaster
where there is serious risk to health or
safety. People do not have to be receiving
any form of benefit to qualify for this
loan.
The Social Fund also provides regulated
payments (payments that are not cash-limited)
to help people awarded certain income-related
benefits with the costs of maternity or
funerals, or with heating during very cold
weather and winter fuel payments.
Widows
Widow’s Payment. Widows under the age of
60—or those over 60 whose husbands were
not entitled to a state retirement pension when
they died—receive a tax-free single payment
of £1,000 following the death of their
husbands, provided that their husbands have
paid a minimum number of NI contributions.
Women whose husbands have died of an
industrial injury or prescribed disease may
also qualify, regardless of whether their
husbands have paid NI contributions.
Widowed Mother’s Allowance, a taxable
benefit of £66.75 a week, is payable to a
widowed mother with at least one child for
whom she is getting Child Benefit. Additional
tax-free amounts of £9.90 for a child for
whom the higher rate of Child Benefit is
payable, and £11.35 for each subsequent child
are available.
Widow’s Pension. A taxable, weekly
benefit of £66.75 a week is payable to a widow
who is 55 years or over when her husband dies
or when her entitlement to Widowed
Mother’s Allowance ends. A percentage of the
full rate is payable to widows who are aged
between 45 and 54 when their husbands die or
when their entitlement to Widowed Mother’s
Allowance ends. Special rules apply for
widows whose husbands died before 11 April
1988. Entitlement continues until the widow
remarries or begins drawing retirement
pension. Payment ends if she lives with a man
as his wife.
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Sickness and Disablement
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate
of Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying
179
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
employees provided their average gross weekly
earnings are at least £66.00 a week. The
weekly rate is £59.55.
Incapacity Benefit is for people who
become incapable of work while they are
employed. Entitlement to Incapacity Benefit
begins when entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay
ends or, for those who do not qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, from the first day of
sickness. There are three types:
• short-term benefit for people under
pension age: a lower rate of £50.35 a
week for the first 28 weeks; and a higher
rate of £59.55 a week between the 29th
and 52nd week;
• short-term benefit for people over
pension age: lower rate of £64.05; higher
rate of £66.75; and
• long-term benefit rate of £66.75 a week
(after 52 weeks of incapacity).
Extra benefits may be paid for dependent
adults and children. Incapacity Benefit is
taxable from the 29th week of incapacity.
The medical test of incapacity for work
usually applies after 28 weeks’ sickness. It
assesses ability to perform a range of work-
related activities rather than the ability to
perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-
free benefit for people who have not been able
to work for at least 28 weeks because of illness
or disability but who cannot get Incapacity
Benefit because they have not paid enough NI
contributions. The benefit is £40.35 a week,
plus additions of up to £14.05 depending on
the person’s age when they became incapable
of work. Additions for adult dependants and
for children may also be paid. Claims may be
made by people aged between 16 and 65. Once
a person has qualified for the allowance, there
is no upper age limit for receipt. New
claimants must satisfy the same incapacity test
as that used in Incapacity Benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80% disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the higher
rate of the Disability Living Allowance care
component (see below), will automatically be
accepted as 80% disabled.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to help severely
disabled people aged under 65 with extra costs
incurred as a result of disability. Entitlement is
measured in terms of personal care and/or
mobility needs. There are two components: a
care component which has three weekly rates—
£52.95, £35.40 and £14.05; and a mobility
component which has two weekly rates—£37.00
and £14.05, payable from age five or older.
Attendance Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to provide
financial help to severely disabled people aged
65 or older with extra costs incurred as a result
of disability. It is measured in terms of
personal care needs by day and/or night. The
two rates are £52.95 and £35.40.
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance of £39.95 weekly may be payable to
people between 16 and 65 who have given up
the opportunity of a full-time paid job because
they are providing regular and substantial care
of at least 35 hours a week, to a severely
disabled person in receipt of either Attendance
Allowance or the higher or middle care
component of Disability Living Allowance. An
additional carer’s premium may be paid if the
recipient is also receiving Income Support,
income-related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing
Benefit or Council Tax Benefit.
Disability Working Allowance (DWA,
which is being replaced by the Disabled
Person’s Tax Credit from October 1999,
payable under the same rules as those for the
new Working Families’ Tax Credit—see
p. 178) is a tax-free, income-related benefit for
people who work at least 16 hours a week but
have an illness or disability that limits their
earning capacity. Awards are for fixed periods
of six months. To claim, a person must be aged
16 or over and have a qualifying benefit, such as
Disability Living Allowance, or a comparable
benefit. The amount paid depends on whether
the person has a partner, and the age and
number of children living with them. People
with savings over £16,000 cannot get DWA.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
180
SOCIAL PROTECTION
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is the tax-free
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit:
up to £108.10 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at
least 14% or more physically or mentally
disabled as a result of an industrial accident or
a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other NI benefits, such as
Incapacity Benefit. It can be paid whether or
not the person returns to work and does not
depend on earnings. The degree of disablement
is assessed by an independent adjudicating
medical authority and the amount paid depends
on the extent of the disablement and on how
long it is expected to last. Except for certain
progressive respiratory diseases, disablement of
less than 14% does not attract Disablement
Benefit. In certain circumstances additional
allowances may be payable.
Housing and Council Tax Benefits
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-
free benefit which helps people on low
incomes meet the cost of rented
accommodation. The amount paid depends on
personal circumstances, income, savings, rent
and other people sharing the home. It also
normally depends on the general level of rents
for properties with the same number of rooms
in the locality.
Most single people under 25 years old who
are not lone parents and who are renting
privately have their Housing Benefit limited to
the average cost of a single non-self-contained
room (that is, shared use of kitchen and toilet
facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to
meet their council tax payments (the tax set by
local councils to help pay for services—see
p. 411). The scheme offers help to those
claiming Income Support and income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance and others with low
incomes. It is subject to rules broadly similar
to those governing the provision of Housing
Benefit (see above). A person who is solely
liable for the council tax may also claim
benefit for a second adult who is not liable to
pay the council tax and who is living in the
home on a non-commercial basis.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a result
of service in the armed forces or for certain
injuries received in the merchant navy or civil
defence during wartime, or to civilians injured
by enemy action. The amount paid depends on
the degree of disablement: the pension for
100% disablement for an officer is £5,985 a
year; for other ranks it is £114.70 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£7.65 and £23.60 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40% or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of pension
for a private soldier’s widow is £86.60 a week.)
War Widow’s Pension is also payable to a former
war widow who has remarried and then become
widowed again, divorced or legally separated.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service helps
and advises war pensioners, war widows and
other dependants. It works closely with ex-
Service organisations and other voluntary bodies
which give financial help and personal support
to those disabled or bereaved as a result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 191), grants towards the cost of
spectacles (see p. 192), legal aid (see p. 235)
and free school meals. People on low incomes,
as well as all pensioners, widows and long-term
sick people on Incapacity Benefit, receive extra
help to meet the cost of VAT (value added tax)
on their fuel bills.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those

Benefit Controls on People from Abroad
Residence Test
All claimants must be habitually resident in
the Common Travel Area (that is, the UK, the
Irish Republic, the Channel Isles or the Isle of
Man) before a claim for Income Support,
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing
Benefit or Council Tax Benefit can be paid.
This is in line with most other European
countries, which also limit access to their
benefit systems to those who have lived in the
country for some time.
Asylum Seekers
Generally only people who claim refugee
status as soon as they arrive in the UK can
claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Income Support, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit. Their eligibility to
receive this will stop if their asylum claim is
refused by the Home Office. A new
Immigration and Asylum Bill (see p. 113) will,
among other things, replace cash benefits for
asylum seekers with a voucher system.
ARRANGEMENTS AND
COMPARISONS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The regulations
also cover retirement pensioners and other
beneficiaries who have been employed, or self-
employed, as well as dependants. Benefits
covered include Child Benefit and those for
sickness and maternity, unemployment,
retirement, invalidity, accidents at work and
occupational diseases.
The UK has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
182
SOCIAL PROTECTION
which also provide cover for some NI benefits
and family benefits.
A comparison of the expenditure on social
protection benefits per head for the 12 EU
countries for which data are available
(Austria, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, the Irish Republic, Italy, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
the UK) indicates that, in general, spending is
much higher in the more northerly countries
than in the south. Denmark spent the most
per head in 1996; at just under £5,000 this
was three times the amount spent by
Portugal, the country which spent the least.
The UK spent around £3,000 per head of
population.

The Government is implementing its plans to modernise the National Health
Service, introducing a new system of integrated care based on partnership and
replacing the competitive ‘internal market’ for healthcare. A new health
strategy for England has been set out in a White Paper Saving Lives. Our
Healthier Nation, published in July 1999, and similar strategies have been
published for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A White Paper tackling
smoking as the single biggest preventable cause of poor health was published in
December 1998.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services, available to all
residents, regardless of their income. Central
government is directly responsible for the
NHS, which is administered by health
authorities and health boards throughout the
UK. The Department of Health (DH) is
responsible for national strategic planning in
England, and within that department, the
NHS Executive, with eight regional offices, is
responsible for developing and implementing
policies for the provision of health services.
The Scottish Executive Health Department,
the National Assembly for Wales and the
Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities.
Policies and initiatives for health in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are similar to
those for England, but may feature distinctive
approaches which reflect the health variations
in the different parts of the UK.
There are 99 health authorities in England
and five in Wales, 15 health boards in
Scotland and four health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland, all of which are
responsible for identifying the healthcare
needs of the people living in their area. They
secure hospital and community health services
and arrange for the provision of services by
family doctors, dentists, pharmacists and
opticians, as well as administering their
contracts. The health authorities and boards
co-operate closely with local authorities
responsible for social work, environmental
health, education and other services. There
are community health councils (local health
councils in Scotland and area health and social
services councils in Northern Ireland)
184
HEALTH SERVICES
covering all parts of the country, representing
local opinion on the services provided.
Among the major targets which the
Government has set for achievement by the
end of this Parliament are:
• to reduce waiting lists in England to
100,000 below (and in Scotland to 10,000
below) the level in May 1997 (see p. 196);
• to begin to reduce inequalities in health,
in particular targeting premature deaths
from heart disease and stroke, cancer and
mental illness; and
• to improve the lives and prospects of
children looked after by local authorities.
During the 20th century there have been
significant changes in the types of disease
that people have suffered from. Certain
infectious diseases, such as smallpox and
diphtheria, have been eradicated whereas
other widespread illnesses such as cancer
and heart disease have become more
prominent. Life expectancy has also altered
dramatically. In 1901 it was 45 years for men
and nearly 49 for women. By 1997 this had
increased to 74 and 79 years respectively.
However, mortality rates have been
consistently higher in Northern Ireland and
Scotland than in England and Wales.
Although some diseases could be
prevented by immunisation at the
beginning of the century, specific cures for
bacterial diseases were not developed before
the 1930s. Advances in surgical techniques
and intensive care now save thousands of
people each year who previously would
have succumbed to accidents, premature
birth or fatal weaknesses caused by other
conditions. Primary preventive medicine
has become more important than cure in
the latter part of the century.
Major Policy Developments
PUBLIC HEALTH
In July 1999 the Government published a
W hite Paper, Saving Lives: Our Healthier
Nation (OHN), setting out its health strategy
for England. Similar strategies have been
published for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The White Paper builds on the work
of the Green Paper Our Healthier Nation,
published in 1998. The two main aims of the
new health strategy are:
• to improve the health of the population
as a whole by increasing the length of
people’s lives and the number of years
people spend free from illness; and
• to improve the health of the least well-off
people in society.
Target Areas
The White Paper sets out action to combat the
four major causes of premature death and
avoidable ill-health: cancer, coronary heart
disease and stroke, accidental injury and
mental illness. Targets have been set for 2010
in each priority area:
• cancer—to reduce the death rate in
people under 75 by at least a fifth;
• coronary heart disease and stroke—to
reduce the death rate in people under 75
by at least two-fifths;
• accidents—to reduce the death rate by at
least a fifth and serious injury by one-
tenth; and
• mental health—to reduce the death rate
from suicide and undetermined injury by
at least one-fifth.
Implementation
The strategy sets out a three-way partnership
in which the Government, communities and
individuals work together for better health.
Government action includes a range of
policies across departments to tackle the
underlying causes of ill health and health
inequality, such as poverty, unemployment,
poor housing and pollution. Policies like Sure
Start (see p. 127), Welfare-to-Work (see
p. 154) and the New Deal for Communities
(see p. 356) all aim to improve health.
There are strategies for other important
public health issues, such as sexual health
(including teenage conceptions), drugs,
alcohol, food safety, water fluoridation and
communicable diseases.
185
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Alongside the White Paper, the Government
published Reducing Health Inequalities: an
Action Report. The report details the broad
range of government action in the light of the
recommendations of the report of the
Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in
Health, published in November 1998.
At local level OHN will be implemented
through the mechanisms in place to deliver
the White Papers on modernising the National
Health Service—The New NHS: Modern,
Dependable—and Modernising Local
Government (see p. 188). Often this means
joint working between the NHS and local
government. Under the Health Act 1999 the
NHS and local authorities have a new duty to
work together to promote the health and well¬
being of their local communities and are free
to share resources.
OHN encourages individuals to safeguard
and improve their own health by quitting
smoking, taking regular physical exercise and
keeping to a healthy diet. It introduces the
Healthy Citizens Programme which builds on
NHS Direct (see p. 190), a nurse-led 24-hour
helpline, and introduces two new main
elements: a Health Skills programme to help
people to help themselves and others, and an
Expert Patients programme to help people
manage their own illness.
Healthy Living Centres
The New Opportunities Fund will allocate
£300 million from the National Lottery (see
p. 121) to fund a series of Healthy Living
Centres throughout the UK. Funding will be
allocated by 2002. Healthy Living Centres are
expected to promote good health in its
broadest sense; to target areas and groups that
represent the most disadvantaged sectors of
the population; and to reduce differences in
the quality of health between individuals. In
England the Fund has defined specific
geographic areas of particular deprivation and
some priority will be given to applications
within health action zones (see p. 189).
Tobacco Control
Cigarette smoking is the greatest cause of
preventable illness and death in the UK. It is
associated with around 120,000 premature
deaths a year (mainly from cancer and heart
and respiratory diseases)—nearly one-fifth of
all deaths. Smoking peaked in the 1950s and
1960s and fell steadily in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, there is evidence to suggest that the
downward trend in smoking may be levelling
out (see chart on p. 187). Adult smoking rates
rose in 1996 for the first time since 1972.
More and more children and young people are
starting to smoke and this upward trend is
particularly noticeable among girls.
Action to reduce smoking, especially
among children and young people, is a
government priority. A White Paper—
Smoking Kills—published in December 1998
set out a number of targets for the UK which
included:
• to reduce smoking among children from
13% to 9% or less by 2010, with a fall to
11% by 2005;
• to reduce adult smoking so that the
overall rate falls from 28% to 24% or less
by 2010, with a fall to 26% by 2005; and
• to reduce the percentage of women who
smoke during pregnancy from 23% to
15% by 2010, with a fall to 18% by 2005.
In addition, the Government produced a
Public Places Charter in September 1999
which committed signatories to improve the
facilities in pubs, bars and restaurants for
customers who do not smoke. The Charter
sets out how this will be implemented,
including a written policy on smoking
available to customers and staff and the
availability of non-smoking areas with
improved ventilation.
Advertising
The Government has published its plans to
implement an EC Directive which bans
tobacco advertising and sponsorship. Subject
to consultation, it is proposed that all general
advertising of tobacco products in the UK will
end by 10 December 1999; tobacco
sponsorship by July 2003; and tobacco
sponsorship of exceptional global events, such
as Formula 1 racing, by October 2006 (see
p. 298).

To quit smoking successfully, some
smokers need to be strongly motivated and
able to deal with the cravings for nicotine.
A course in nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT) provides the body with nicotine in
decreasing doses until the craving is small
enough to cope with. Following the White
Paper on tobacco, the profile of NRT will
be raised to encourage smokers to use it. In
addition, for less well-off smokers, the
NHS will provide one week’s free NRT
along with specialist advice and support.
Evidence shows that smokers who manage
to avoid smoking for a complete week with
the help of NRT are more likely to go on
to quit for good.
Tax
Research shows that the demand for tobacco
products is related to their price: as prices rise,
demand falls. High tax levels are therefore one
important means of reducing tobacco
consumption—tax currently accounts for
almost 80% of the price of a packet of
cigarettes. The current government
commitment is that tobacco duties will be
increased on average by at least 5% a year in
real terms. The price of a typical packet of 20
cigarettes at the end of 1998 was £3.66, about
55p higher in real terms than at the end of
1996.
REFORMS IN MANAGEMENT
Management reforms introduced under the
NHS and Community Care Act 1990 created a
form of competition in the running of the
NHS—the so-called ‘internal market’. This
was achieved by making a division between
purchasers and providers of healthcare. Under
this system, ‘purchasers’ (health authorities/
health boards and some general practitioners
—GPs—see p. 194) were given budgets to
buy healthcare from ‘providers’ (acute
hospitals; organisations providing care for the
mentally ill, people with learning disabilities
and the elderly; and ambulance services). To
become a provider in the internal market,
health organisations became NHS Trusts,
independent organisations with their own
187
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
managements, competing with each other. By
1995, all hospital and community healthcare,
other than in the Scottish island health board
areas, was provided by NHS Trusts.
Over the same period, many GPs were also
given their own budgets with which to buy
healthcare from NHS Trusts in a scheme called
GP fundholding. Not all GPs joined this scheme
and their budgets continued to be controlled
by health authorities/health boards, which
bought healthcare in bulk from NHS 'Trusts.
Current Reforms
In December 1997 the Government published
its White Paper, The New NHS: Modern,
Dependable, which outlined a ten-year
programme of modernisation of the NHS in
England. Similar proposals were published for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These
differ in some details from those in England
but are designed to achieve similar aims.
The English White Paper proposed the
replacement of the competitive internal
market—the present Government considers
that the business culture of the internal market
is at odds with the ethos of the NHS and its
workforce. Instead a new system of integrated
care is being introduced to deliver quicker,
higher-quality services to patients. This forms
the basis for a ten-year programme to renew
and improve the NHS through evolutionary
change rather than organisational upheaval.
The Government has retained the separation
between planning and providing services, but
is ending competition and replacing it with a
new statutory duty for all NHS bodies to work
in partnership with each other and with local
authorities.
The Government announced its intention
to release £1 billion from spending on
administration over five years. By the end of
1998_99 it is estimated that around £250
million, which would otherwise have been
spent on administrative support, was available
for patient care.
Health Authorities
Health authorities provide the strategic
leadership for all those working in the local
health service. They are responsible for
preparing a Health Improvement Programme
in partnership with local Primary Care Groups,
Primary Care Trusts, NHS Trusts, local
authorities, local people and voluntary groups.
Health authorities have two vital roles: to
ensure that service improvements for local
people are coherently planned and delivered;
and to provide strategic leadership for
improving health and tackling health inequalities.
They aim to ensure that all parts of the
NHS locally work together and are properly
equipped to deal with NHS modernisation,
applying and sharing good practice, and
providing effective performance management.
Each authority in England is run by a board
consisting of a non-executive chair (appointed
by the Secretary of State for Health), usually
together with five non-executive members
(also appointed by the Secretary of State) and
five executive members.
Primary Care Groups
GP fundholding will be abolished in October
1999 (except in Northern Ireland where the
fundholding scheme will remain in place).
Primary Care Groups were introduced in each
area, in April 1999, putting GPs and
community nurses in charge of shaping
services for all patients. The Groups, which
are accountable to the local health authority,
are responsible for commissioning services for
their local communities. GPs and community
nurses have a choice about the form their
primary care takes. Typically Groups may
each serve about 100,000 patients. 1 hey have
a single unified budget, which gives GPs
maximum choice in how patients’ needs are
met. All Primary Care Groups are expected to
work closely with social services to provide
properly integrated care.
Primary Care Trusts are larger, more
independent Primary Care Groups which
involve groups of doctors, nurses and social
care professionals—as well as other
organisations and agencies—working in
partnership to shape local health and social
care services. They are free-standing statutory
bodies and carry out many functions formerly
performed by health authorities. They will
also be able to provide a range of community
health services directly.
188
HEALTH SERVICES
NHS Trusts
NHS Trusts remain responsible for treatment
and care, but are also party to the local Health
Improvement Programmes. Short-term
contracts have ended and NHS Trusts will
agree long-term service agreements with
Primary Care Groups. These service
agreements are generally organised around
care groups (such as children) or disease areas
(such as heart disease). In this way, hospital
clinicians have a greater say in shaping local
services for patients. From November 1999
NHS Trusts, for the first time, will have a
statutory duty to meet quality standards, and
from April 2000 there will be a duty to co¬
operate with other parts of the NHS. They are
required to take part (alongside Primary Care
Groups and local authorities) in developing
the Health Improvement Programmes under
the leadership of the health authority. NHS
Trusts are now more accountable to the public
and publish details of their performance,
including the costs of treatments and services.
Quality Standards
An integral part of the modernisation
programme for the NHS set out in 1997
included proposals for new standards of quality
and efficiency that will guarantee better services
for patients. National Service Frameworks
(NSFs) will set national standards and describe
service models for a defined service or care
group. They will put in place programmes to
support implementation and establish
performance measures against which progress
within an agreed timescale will be measured.
Building on existing frameworks for cancer and
paediatric intensive care, NSFs for coronary
heart disease and mental health will be published
in 1999, an NSF for older people in spring 2000
and an NSF for diabetes in spring 2001.
The National Institute for Clinical
Excellence (NICE) was established on 1 April
1999 and intends to develop clear national
standards for best practice in clinical care
within the NHS. This includes drawing up
new guidelines based on clinical and cost
effectiveness and ensuring that they reach all
parts of the NHS. The Institute’s membership
is drawn from the health professions, the
NHS, academics, health economists and
patients. The NICE will become a central
point of contact for dissemination of reliable
information about health and treatment of ill-
health. It brings together the work of the
National Prescribing Centre, PRODIGY (a
computer-based system for GPs to help them
with prescribing medicines), the National
Centre for Clinical Audit, the Prescriber’s
Journal, the National Guidelines Programme,
the Professional Audit Programme and
Effectiveness Bulletins.
Under the Health Act 1999, an independent
Commission for Health Improvement will be
established to oversee the quality of clinical
services at local level, and to tackle
shortcomings. Where there are shortfalls in the
quality of clinical services, the Commission
will have the capacity to identify the source of
the problem, and work with the organisation
concerned to put these right. It will undertake
a systematic review of action taken locally and
nationally to monitor progress in the
implementation across the NHS of the
standards set by the NSFs. The Commission’s
membership will include those with a wide
range of expertise and backgrounds, including
clinical, academic and lay experience.
Health Action Zones
In 1998 the first ‘health action zones’ were set
up in 11 areas of England, covering almost 6
million people, and a further 15 zones started
in April 1999. Concentrated in areas of
deprivation, the zones involve local
partnerships between the health service, local
councils, voluntary groups and local
businesses, and receive government funding.
Their job is to make measurable
improvements in the health of local people
and in the quality of treatment and care.
Working closely with the DH, the participants
explore ways of breaking through current
organisational boundaries to tackle
inequalities, and delivering better services and
healthcare, building upon and encouraging co¬
operation across the NHS.
Two health action zones have also been
established in Northern Ireland from April 1999
and an initiative to encourage local healthcare
partnerships has been launched in Scotland.
189
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
NHS Direct, a 24-hour nurse-led helpline,
was piloted in three areas in March 1998.
The principle is to provide people at home
with easier and faster advice and
information about health, illness and the
NHS so that they are better able to care
for themselves and their families.
The three pilot schemes—based in
Milton Keynes, Preston and Newcastle
upon Tyne—between them covered more
than 1.5 million people and up to the end
of December 1998 had taken over 60,000
calls. Independent research showed that
97% of users were satisfied with the
service provided, which they found
prompt, friendly and professional. A
range of organisations has been involved
in the delivery of the pilot schemes,
including the ambulance service, GP co¬
operatives, the Health Information
Service, community trusts and social
services. By April 1999 further centres
had been opened covering the West
Midlands, west London, Essex,
Nottinghamshire, Manchester, West
Yorkshire, Hampshire, and also Lambeth,
Southwark and Lewisham in south
London, giving over 20 million people
access to the helpline; 60% of the country
will have access by December 1999.
In March 1999 it was announced that
NHS Direct Scotland would be piloted
with the support of GP co-operatives.
Plans are to establish pilot sites early in
2000.
By 2002 the first generation of EHRs will be
in use, followed by 2005 by the first
generation of EHRs with 24-hour access.
NHSnet
NHSnet is the short name for a range of voice
and data services used by the NHS, covering
radio, telephone and computer-based
communications. All health authorities and
most Trusts are connected to NHSnet, as are
a number of major third-party suppliers to
the NHS. The White Paper (The New
NHS—see above) signalled both the
expansion and wider exploitation ot NHSnet
services by the NHS. Regional demonstration
sites in England have been established to
illustrate direct patient benefits from
NHSnet, and targets have been set to ensure
that primary care staff can start to use
NHSnet for both general and clinical
communications. By 2002 a wide range of
activities, such as the transfer of laboratory
results to GPs, will be carried out
electronically. All Scottish GPs are connected
to NHSnet. NHSnet will also support the
longer-term goal of introducing EHRs to
replace the paper-based records. This will
enable, for example, secure access by doctors
to a patient’s records in an emergency when
they are away from home. An equivalent
scheme, HPSSnet has been set up in
Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland
Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS).
This is an electronic data network linking
HPSS organisations and some other affiliated
bodies.
Electronic Health Records
As part of the Government’s information
technology (IT) programme in the NHS,
organisational records, mainly now in paper
form, will become the Electronic Patient
Records and in time be part of a lifelong
record of each individual’s health and
healthcare—the Electronic Health Record
(EHR). This will mean that healthcare
professionals will have access to the relevant
elements of patients’ histories to enable them
to deliver care more effectively. Pilot sites will
be selected to test different types of system for
building and using records from April 2000.
The National Health Service
The NHS is based on the principle that there
should be a full range of publicly funded services
designed to help the individual stay healthy. The
services are intended to provide effective and
appropriate treatment and care where necessary
while making the best use of available resources.
All taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to the cost so that those members of
the community who do not require healthcare
help to pay for those who do. Most forms of
treatment, such as hospital care, are generally
provided free, although some may incur a charge.
190
HEALTH SERVICES
ADMINISTRATION
Expenditure
The Health and Personal Social Services
Programmes consist of:
• NHS Hospital and Community Health
Services (HCHS), providing all hospital
care and a range of community services;
• NHS Family Health Services (FHS),
providing general medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and some ophthalmic
services, and covering the cost of
medicines prescribed by GPs;
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS)—in Scotland, Other
Health Services (OHS)—which provide
services administered centrally (for
example, certain public health functions
and support to the voluntary sector);
• provision of social care by local authorities,
supported by the DH and the Department
of the Environment, Transport and the
Regions’ programmes in England, and the
Scottish Executive in Scotland; and
• the administration of the DH.
Comprehensive Spending Review
The results of the Comprehensive Spending
Review were announced by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in 1998 and the White Paper Modern
Public Services for Britain: Investing in Reform
(see p. 400) sets out details of an extra ^18 billion
for the NHS in England over the three years
1999-2000 to 2001-02, with an extra ^1.8 billion
for Scotland. This funding includes an ‘NHS
Modernisation Fund’ of at least £5 billion to take
forward the Government’s modernisation
programme covering specific service
improvements such as IT and capital investment.
Over £1 billion has been allocated from the
Fund for 1999—2000. The key priorities for
extra resources are:
• cutting waiting lists;
• modernising hospitals and systems;
• investing in NHS staff;
• ensuring safe and effective mental health
care;
• providing better primary care; and
• improving health promotion.
Finance
The NHS is financed mainly through general
taxation with an element of National
Insurance contributions (see chapter 12), paid
by employed people, their employers and self-
employed people. The remainder is financed
through charges, such as for drugs prescribed
by family doctors, receipts from land sales and
the proceeds of income generation schemes. In
1998—99, 75% of the NHS was financed
through general taxation, with 13% from
National Insurance contributions and 12%
from charges and other receipts.
Health authorities may raise funds from other
sources. For example, some hospitals increase
revenue by taking private patients, who pay the
full cost of their accommodation and treatment.
Over 510 million prescription items, worth
around £4.7 billion, were dispensed in
England in 1998, an increase of 32% in real
terms since 1993. The proportion of items
provided free of charge increased from 82% in
1993 to 85% in 1998. The following groups
are exempted from prescription charges:
people aged 60 and over; children under 16
and young people aged 16, 17 or 18 in full¬
time education; women who are pregnant or
have given birth in the previous 12 months;
and people with certain medical conditions. In
addition, people who receive (or whose
partners receive) certain social security
benefits (see chapter 12) or who otherwise
qualify on low income grounds, do not pay
prescription charges. In 1998, 50% of all
prescription items dispensed by community
pharmacies and appliance contractors in
England were for elderly people, an increase
from around 44% in 1993.
There are charges for most types of NHS
dental treatment, including examinations,
based on a proportion of the fee paid to the
dentist. However, the following people are
entitled to free treatment: women who begin a
course of treatment while pregnant or within
12 months of having a baby; children under
16; full-time students under 19; and adults on
low incomes or receiving the same benefits or
tax credits as for free prescriptions.

Since 1989 free NHS sight tests have been
restricted to children, full-time students under
the age of 19, adults on low incomes or
receiving the same benefits or tax credits as for
free prescriptions, and people who have, or are
at particular risk of, eye disease. In April 1999
the Government restored free sight tests to
people aged 60 and over.
For the most part, family practitioners (GPs,
dentists, optometrists and community
pharmacists) are either self-employed or (in the
case of pharmacists and optometrists) are
employed by independent businesses. They, or
the companies they work for, agree to provide
services on the NHS’s behalf, and are paid by
health authorities for doing so. Most GPs are
paid by a system of fees and allowances
designed to reflect responsibilities, workload
and practice expenses. Most dentists are paid by
a combination of capitation fees for children
registered with the practice, continuing care
payments for adults registered, and a prescribed
scale of fees for individual treatments.
Community pharmacists are paid professional
fees for dispensing NHS prescriptions, as well
as being reimbursed for the cost of the drugs
and appliances concerned. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and optometrists providing general
ophthalmic services for the NHS receive
approved fees for each sight test carried out.
NHS Workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people. Staff costs account for approximately
70% of current spending on hospitals and
community health services.
Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the
NHS is designed to make NHS organisations
more accountable and provide greater public
access to information. The Code applies to
NHS Trusts, health authorities/boards and
local health practitioners such as GPs, dentists
and pharmacists. It sets out the information
that health authorities/boards and NHS
Trusts should publish or otherwise make
available.

HEALTH SERVICES
The NHS Code contains, among other
things:
• information about services provided, the
targets and standards set and results
achieved, and the costs and effectiveness
of services;
• details of important proposals on health
policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered; and
• information about how people can have
access to their own personal health records.
NHS Complaints System
There is a mechanism for dealing with
complaints about all NHS-funded treatments
and services. The primary aim of the
procedure is to resolve complaints speedily at
local level, but where the complainant remains
dissatisfied with the local response he or she
can request an independent review of the
complaint. Where an independent review
panel investigation takes place, a report setting
out suggestions and recommendations will be
produced. Complainants who remain
dissatisfied after independent review, or
whose request for a panel investigation is
turned down, can refer their complaint to the
Health Service Commissioner.
In 1997—98 a total of 88,757 written
complaints were made about both hospital and
community health services and family health
services in England, a decline from 92,974 in
1996-97. The main reasons for complaints
were aspects of clinical treatment, staff
attitudes, communication and information,
and appointment delays and cancellations. In
Scotland, 9,736 written complaints were
made, compared with 10,648 in 1996-97.
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each for
England, Scotland and Wales) are responsible
for investigating complaints directly from
members of the public about health service
bodies. The three posts are at present held by
one person (with a staff of about 250), who is
also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman—see p. 52). As
Health Service Commissioner, he reports
annually to Parliament. In Scotland he reports
to the Scottish Parliament. In Northern
Ireland complaints about health and social
services bodies are investigated by the
Commissioner for Complaints (the
Ombudsman).
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive or
maladministration by an NHS authority;
or
• action by health professionals arising
from the exercise of clinical judgment.
Complaints must be sent to the
Commissioner in writing, and the health
service body concerned should first have been
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
In 1998—99 a total of 2,869 written complaints
were received regarding both hospital and
community health services and family health
services—an increase from 2,660 in 1997-98.
Patient’s Charters
Patient’s Charters set out the rights of patients
and the standards of service they can expect to
receive from the NHS. The original Patient’s
Charter in England came into force in 1992
and an expanded version was issued in 1995,
covering dental, optical and pharmaceutical
services and the hospital environment. The
Patient’s Charter sets national standards,
which are not legal rights but specific
standards of service that the NHS aims to
provide. These cover respect for the
individual patient; waiting times for
ambulances, clinical assessment in Accident
and Emergency departments and
appointments in out-patient clinics; and
cancellation of operations.
Separate though broadly similar Patient’s
Charters have been developed for Scotland
and Wales. In Northern Ireland the Charter
for Patients and Clients covers social care
services as well as health.
193
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Government considers that the existing
Charter fails to give proper weight to the
quality of clinical care and patients’ own
experiences of how well the service has been
delivered. Work is currently under way on a
new NHS Charter programme to replace the
existing Patient’s Charter by April 2000. The
new Charter in England will concentrate on the
quality and success of treatment, and aim to
provide a better balance between the rights of
patients and their responsibilities towards the
NHS. New Charters are also being developed
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The Family Health Services are those
provided to patients by doctors (GPs),
dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their
own choice. They remain the first point of
contact with the NHS for most people. In
England there are over 270 million
consultations with GPs each year. Often those
who visit their GP or dentist need no clinical
treatment but healthy lifestyle counselling and
preventive healthcare advice instead. The last
decade has seen continued growth of the
Family Health Services in line with long¬
standing government policy to build up and
extend these services both to improve health
and to relieve pressure on the more costly
secondary care sector (that is, hospital and
specialist services).
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness, give advice and may prescribe a
suitable course of treatment or refer a patient
to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Most GPs in the UK work in
partnerships or group practices. Primary
healthcare teams also include health visitors
and district nurses, midwives, and sometimes
social workers and other professional staff
employed by the health authorities. Most GPs
in Great Britain and about half in Northern
Ireland work in health centres. As well as
providing medical and nursing services, health
centres may have facilities for health
education, family planning, speech therapy,
chiropody, assessment of hearing,
physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental,
pharmaceutical and ophthalmic services,
hospital out-patient and supporting social
work services may also be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary healthcare staff in recent years. For
example, between 1988 and 1998 the number
of GPs in England rose steadily at a rate of
0.8% a year, to 29,696 (a whole-time
equivalent of 25,831). Between autumn 1997
and autumn 1998, around 300 new GPs
started work, which included 100 extra GP
trainees. Doctors had about 7% fewer patients
on their lists in 1998 than in 1988, with an
average list size per GP in 1998 of 1,866.
Similarly, the number of general dental
practitioners continues to grow, rising to
16,761 in 1998, 2.8% more than in 1997.
New Initiatives in Primary Care
The NHS (Primary Care) Act 1997 is
designed to allow flexibility in the delivery of
primary healthcare services for patients. It
enables GPs, dentists, NHS Trusts and NHS
employees to work with health authorities and
health boards to develop new ways of
delivering primary care under local contracts.
In 1997 the Government launched its
Investing in Dentistry scheme in England, to
help improve dental care in areas of poor
availability and poor oral health. Similar
schemes are in operation in Scotland and
Wales. Around 300 schemes in England have
been approved for funding, giving over 650,000
patients the opportunity to register with an
NHS dentist. Assistance includes grants to
dentists to help expand or set up new practices
in return for long-term commitment to the
NHS, and support for newly qualified dentists
and women returning from a career break. Up
to £19 million was made available between
1997_98 and 1998-99. The Government is
working on a new strategy for NHS dentistry in
England due to be published later in 1999.
The Department of Health is also
preparing a strategy document, to be
published in late 1999, on developing the role
of community pharmacists within the NHS to
make better use of their skills. Current pilot
projects involve repeat and instalment
dispensing, which has the potential to improve
monitoring of treatment and reduce GP
194
HEALTH SERVICES
paperwork and drug waste; and schemes
where pharmacists provide support for
patients with medication-related problems,
such as complex regimes or difficulties in
taking medication effectively.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal
period (up to 28 days after the baby is born).
Midwives work in both hospital and
community settings. Health visitors are
responsible for the preventive care and health
promotion of families, particularly those with
young children. They identify local health
needs and work closely with GPs, district
nurses and other professions. District nurses
give skilled nursing care to people at home or
elsewhere outside hospital; they also play an
important role in health promotion and
education. Practice nurses are based in GP
surgeries. They carry out treatments and give
advice on health promotion, working closely
with GPs, and with other community nurses.
Since 1998 district nurses and health visitors
and some nurses based in GP practices have
been able to prescribe from a limited list of
drugs and medical appliances. This has helped
to reduce the time patients have to wait for
relief of their symptoms.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad
spectrum of clinical specialities, supported by a
range of other services, such as anaesthetics,
pathology and radiology. Almost all have
facilities for the admission of emergency
patients, either through Accident and
Emergency departments or as direct referrals
from GPs. Treatments are provided for in¬
patients, day cases, out-patients and patients
who attend wards for treatment such as
dialysis. Some hospitals also provide specialist
services covering more than one region or
district, for example, for heart and liver
transplants, craniofacial services, and rare eye
and bone cancers. There are also specialist
hospitals such as the world-famous Hospital
for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street,
Moorfields Eye Hospital, and the National
Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, all
in London. These hospitals combine specialist
treatment facilities with the training of medical
and other students, and international research.
Less than a third of hospitals now pre-date
the formation of the NHS in 1948. While much
has been done to improve existing hospital
buildings, the largest building programme in
the history of the NHS is currently in progress,
including several major Private Finance
Initiative schemes (see p. 196).
Greater Accountability for NHS Trusts
Each NHS Trust (HSS Trust in Northern
Ireland) is run by a board of executive and
non-executive directors, subject to provisions
in the Health Act 1999. Trusts are free to
employ their own staff and set their own rates
of pay, although staff transferring to Trust
employment retain their existing terms and
conditions of service. Trusts are also free to
carry out research and provide facilities for
medical education and other forms of training.
The internal market has been replaced with a
system of partnership and co-operation (see
p. 188). Each health authority is responsible
for leading the development of a Health
Improvement Programme for its local area.
NHS Trusts work with health authorities,
local authorities and local people to ensure
that the Programme reflects the needs of the
local population. Trusts’ main contribution
remains the provision of hospital and
community services to patients. The services
they provide will be subject to the new quality
standards set by the NICE (see p. 189). If any
NHS Trusts fail to meet such standards, then
the Commission for Health Improvement
(see p. 189) may step in to find ways where
improvements can be made.
Since 1998 all Trust board meetings have
been required to be open to the public.
Measures have also been taken to make boards
more representative of the local communities.
Waiting Lists in England

the admission takes place. Of patients admitted
from waiting lists, half are admitted within six
weeks, and around two-thirds within three
months. In May 1997 there were just under 1.2
million patients waiting for NHS treatment in
England and this figure had been increasing,
while in-patient and out-patient waiting times
had been getting longer.
The Government is aiming to reduce the
level of NHS waiting lists and times by
100,000 by the end of the present Parliament.
At the end of 1998-99, the number of patients
waiting for NHS treatment had fallen to just
under 1.1 million. The Government has also
said that no patient should have to wait longer
than 18 months for admission and this was
achieved for the first time in March 1998. It
has made a commitment that no woman
should wait longer than two weeks for an out¬
patient appointment if referred urgently with
suspected breast cancer. By 2000 this standard
will apply to all cancers.
The Government made £417 million
available to reduce waiting lists in England in
1998—99 and will invest a further £320 million
in 1999-2000. Under a new National Booked
Admissions Programme, patients will be able to
pre-book their appointments for a time
convenient to them.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was
launched in 1992 to promote partnership
between the public and private sectors on a
commercial basis (see chapter 24). In the
health service it involves the use of private
finance in NHS capital projects for the design,
construction and operation of buildings and
support services. The Government introduced
legislation in 1997 to reinvigorate the system
by clarifying powers of NHS Trusts to sign
PFI agreements, and, following a review of
PFI hospital building schemes in England,
announced a major new hospital building
programme. Under this, 25 major hospital
schemes in England—with a capital value of
around £2.2 billion—have been approved to
proceed. Eleven major PFI schemes in
Scotland worth £408 million are also
proceeding. In Wales, 15 PFI schemes with a
capital value of around £35 million have been
concluded, including a community hospital,
day surgery and endoscopy facilities, sterile
services and staff residences, while further
schemes are planned including a major general
hospital.
The hospitals will be designed, built,
maintained and owned by the private sector,
which will lease the completed facilities back
to the NHS. Clinical services will continue to
be provided by NHS staff, and the NHS will
remain in control of the key planning and
clinical decisions. On current plans the PFI
will provide over £600 million worth ol capital
investment in 1999—2000.

ABBEYS & PRIORIES
Haughmond Abbey: near Shrewsbury in Shropshire.
The earliest records date from 1135 and refer to ‘Prior Folk
and his brethren’. Early in the 12th century it attracted the
patronage of the FitzAlan family, who supported Queen Matilda
in the Civil Wars of King Stephen’s reign and were well rewarded
when her son came to the throne as Henry II in 1154.
Haughmond was richly endowed and gained the status,
unusual for an Augustinian house, of an abbey.
Sweetheart: founded in 1273 by
Devorguilla de Balliol. When her husband died,
Devorguilla had his heart embalmed and put in
an ivory and silver casket, which she always
carried with her, and the abbey became known
as Dulce Cor, or Sweetheart. She also founded
Balliol College in Oxford and named it after her
husband. The abbey is situated at New Abbey,
8 miles south of Dumfries.
 J
Llanthony: St David, patron saint of
Wales, built a cell on the present site of
St David’s church in the 6th century.
During the reign of William Rufus,
son of William the Conqueror,
William de Lacy, a Norman knight,
came across the remains. He decided
to dedicate the rest of his life to religious
contemplation and rebuilding the chapel.
In 1103 word of William de Lacy
reached the court of Henry I and inspired
Ernisius, chaplain to Queen Matilda,
to join the knight. By 1108 they had
gathered a band of followers, formed a
monastic settlement and built the first
priory church of Llanthony. Between
1175 and 1230 their modest achievements
were replaced by a magnificent structure,
the ruins of which are visible today.
Llanthony is 8 miles from Abergavenny
in Monmouthshire.
Grey Abbey: founded in 1193 by
Affreca, daughter of the King of
Man and wife of John de Courcy,
as a thanksgiving for a safe sea
journey during a ferocious storm.
It is unusual, showing early Gothic-
features, at a time when late
Romanesque work was common
elsewhere in Ireland. This Cistercian
abbey, 10 miles east of Belfast on
the Ards peninsula. County Down,
was used for worship as late as the
18th century.
HEALTH SERVICES
Organ Transplants
The United Kingdom Transplant Support
Service Authority (a special health authority
of the NHS) provides a 24-hour support
service to all transplant units in the UK for
the matching and allocation of organs for
transplant. During 1998, 1,593 kidney
transplants were performed. (There were also
23 kidney/pancreas transplants.) A similar
service exists for corneas and, in 1998, over
2,200 were transplanted.
There are seven designated thoracic
transplant centres in England, and one in
Scotland. In 1998, 281 heart, 88 lung, and 52
heart/lung transplants were performed. There
are six designated liver transplant units in
England and one in Scotland. In 1998, 693
liver transplants were performed.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. The NHS Organ Donor Register is a
computer database of those willing to be organ
donors. By June 1999 it contained 7.6 million
names. Commercial dealing in organs for
transplant is illegal in the UK.
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service,
the Welsh Blood Service and the Northern
Ireland Blood Transfusion Agency. The UK
is self-sufficient in blood components.
In the UK around 3 million donations are
given each year by voluntary unpaid donors.
These are made into many different life¬
saving products for patients. Red cells,
platelets and other components with a limited
‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood centres,
whereas the production of plasma products is
undertaken at the Bio Products Laboratory in
Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the Protein
Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national blood services co¬
ordinates programmes for donor recruitment,
retention and education, and donor sessions
are organised regionally, in towns, villages and
workplaces. Donors are normally aged
between 17 and 70. Blood centres are
responsible for blood collection, screening,
processing and supplying hospital blood
banks. They also provide laboratory, clinical,
research, teaching and specialist advisory
services and facilities. These blood centres are
subject to nationally co-ordinated quality
audit programmes, through the Medicines
Control Agency.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
to the public through the 999 telephone call
system for cases of sudden illness or collapse
and for accidents. They are also available for
doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid response services,
in which paramedics use cars and motorcycles
to reach emergency cases, have been
introduced in a number of areas, particularly
London and other major cities with areas of
high traffic density. Helicopter ambulances,
provided through local charities, serve many
parts of the country and an integrated NHS-
funded air ambulance service is available
throughout Scotland. Between 1997-98 and
1998—99 the number of emergency calls rose
by 8% to 3.8 million and the number of
emergency patient journeys grew by 2%.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are free to NHS patients considered by their
doctor (or dentist or midwife) to be medically
unfit to travel by other means. In many areas
the ambulance service organises volunteer
drivers to provide a hospital car service for
non-urgent patients. Patients on low incomes
may be eligible for reimbursement of costs of
travelling to hospital.
Rehabilitation
NHS and social services undertake
rehabilitation work for large numbers of
people of all ages to restore and maintain their
independence and social participation.
Rehabilitation plays an important role in
improving the quality of life of people,
enabling them to return to, or remain in,
employment or education and preventing
inappropriate admissions to hospital or long¬
term care.
197
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Health and social services are encouraged
to develop a range of rehabilitative options and
to be flexible in meeting people’s needs. A
new Partnership Grant, announced in the
Modernising Social Services White Paper
(see p. 165) and totalling nearly £650 million
over three years, has a particular emphasis on
improving rehabilitation services and avoiding
unnecessary admissions to hospital and other
institutional care. The Health Act 1999 has
also introduced new operational flexibilities
for the NHS and local government in
connection with developing innovative
rehabilitation services.
Hospices
Hospice or palliative care is a special type of
care for people whose illness may no longer be
curable; it enables them to achieve the best
possible quality of life during the final stages.
The care may be provided in a variety of
settings: at home (with support from specially
trained staff), in a hospice or palliative care
unit, in hospital or at a hospice day centre.
Hospice or palliative care focuses on
controlling pain and other distressing symptoms
and providing psychological support to patients,
their families and friends, both during the
patient’s illness and into bereavement.
Palliative care was first developed in the
UK in 1967 by the voluntary hospices and
continues to be provided by them in many
areas, but is now also provided within NHS
palliative care units, hospitals and community
services.
Hospices and palliative care services mostly
help people with cancer, although patients
with other life-threatening illnesses, such as
AIDS, are also cared for. Several hospices
provide respite care for children from birth to
16 years of age.
The National Council for Hospices and
Specialist Palliative Care Services is an
umbrella organisation which brings together
both voluntary and health service providers in
order to provide a co-ordinated view of the
service; it covers England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Its Scottish counterpart is
the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative
and Cancer Care.
Private Medical Treatment
Some NHS hospitals share expensive equipment
with private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the
private sector w hen it represents value for
money. The scale of private practice in relation
to the NHS is, however, relatively small.
It has been estimated that about three-
quarters of those receiving acute treatment in
private hospitals or NHS hospital pay beds are
funded by health insurance schemes, which
make provision for private healthcare in return
for annual subscriptions. According to the
Consumers’ Association, 12.7% of people in
the UK subscribe to such schemes, compared
with fewer than 2% in the 1950s. Around 60%
of these are covered by group schemes, some
arranged by firms on behalf of employees.
Many overseas patients come to the UK for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics.
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided under
the NHS to safeguard the health of pregnant
women and of mothers with young children.
Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 203).
A woman is entitled to care throughout her
pregnancy, the birth and the postnatal period.
Care may be provided by a midwife, a
community-based GP, a hospital-based
obstetrician, or a combination of these. The
birth may take place in a hospital maternity
unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at home.
After the birth, a midwife will visit until the
baby is at least ten days old and after that a
health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a woman is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
Prescriptions for children, including older
children (up to the age of 19 when in full-time
education), are free of charge.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance, provided for pre-school children
(under five years of age), is run by community
198
HEALTH SERVICES
health trusts and GPs who receive an annual
payment for every child registered on the
programme. This enables doctors, dentists and
health visitors to oversee the health and
development of pre-school children so that any
health problems are picked up and appropriate
intervention arranged as early and as quickly as
possible. The Health Education Authority
produces a child development book Birth to
Five, which is a complete guide to the early
stages of development, nutrition, weaning and
common childhood ailments; it is made
available to all first-time mothers free of charge.
There is a welfare food scheme for mothers
on low income, where distribution of formula
feed and vitamins is free of charge. This is
often undertaken at the child health clinic.
New mothers also receive a Personal Child
Health Record for their child. This is based on
a model record produced by the Royal College
of Paediatrics and Child Health. It enables and
prompts parents to keep an easy access record
of immunisation, tests, birth details and health
checks. Children of school age attending a
state-maintained school have access to the
school health service, as well as usually being
registered with a GP and local dentist. In
addition to providing health advice to children
and young people, the school health service
assists teachers with pupils having medical
needs. This is supplemented by guidance
produced by the Department for Education
and Employment, in collaboration with DH.
Work has been undertaken to build up the
‘Wired for Health’ Internet website as an
additional resource in the promotion of good
health and well-being for schoolchildren.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems. In recent years special efforts have
been made to improve co-operation between
the community-based child health services and
local authority education and social services for
children. This is particularly important in the
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care (see p. 168).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
the UK in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications were
examined by a committee of inquiry under
Baroness Warnock (1984) and led eventually
to the passage of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990, one of the most
comprehensive pieces of legislation on assisted
reproduction and embryo research in the
world.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA) licenses and controls
centres providing certain infertility
treatments, undertaking human embryo
research or storing gametes or embryos. The
HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance to licensed centres and reports
annually to Parliament.
The law prohibits surrogacy arrangements
made on a commercial basis and prohibits any
advertising concerning surrogacy. An
independent review of aspects of surrogacy law
was set up in 1997 to consider whether
payments, including expenses, to surrogate
mothers should continue to be allowed and, if so,
on what basis; to examine whether there is a case
for regulating surrogacy arrangements through a
recognised body; and to advise whether changes
are needed to the present legislation. Following
the publication of the review team’s report in
October 1998, its recommendations are under
consideration.
Family Planning
The Government’s public health strategy aims
to ensure the provision of effective family
planning services. Free family planning advice
and treatment is available from GPs or from
family planning clinics. Clinics are also able to
provide condoms and other contraceptives
free of charge.
Teenage Pregnancies
DH is working closely with the Government’s
Social Exclusion Unit (see p. 117) to develop a
strategy on teenage pregnancy. Live birth
rates to women under 20 in England and
Wales are the highest in Western Europe. In
199
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
1997, the conception rate for girls under the
age of 16 was 8,9 per 1,000 women; the
majority of these conceptions were to girls
aged 15.
The Social Exclusion Unit was asked to
build on work already done by DH, and make
recommendations aimed at cutting the rates of
teenage parenthood—particularly under-age
parenthood—to the European average and to
propose better solutions to combat the risk of
social exclusion for vulnerable teenagers and
their children. The Unit’s report was
published in June 1999 and sets out a national
programme with two goals: to halve by 2010
the rate of conceptions in England among
those aged under 18 and to lessen the risks of
young parents suffering the consequences of
social exclusion by getting more teenage
parents back into education, training or
employment. A £60 million package of
measures includes:
• a new task force of ministers, led by the
Minister for Public Health, to co-ordinate
the policy across government, supported
by an implementation unit in DH;
• a national publicity campaign to reinforce
the report’s key messages;
• improved access to contraceptive and
sexual health services for teenagers;
• new guidance on sex and relationships
education in school; and
• special action targeted on prevention for
the most vulnerable groups, including
children looked after by a local authority,
those excluded from school and young
offenders.
The Minister for Public Health is
developing an action programme on sexual
and reproductive health for all health
authorities and local authorities in England. It
will bring together current initiatives in sexual
health, including the HIV/AIDS strategy (see
p. 204), work on chlamydia, and the Social
Exclusion Unit report.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a
time limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest
category of abortion—risk to the physical or
mental health of the pregnant woman—and
also to abortion because of a similar risk to any
existing children of her family. There are
three categories in which no time limit applies:
to prevent grave permanent injury to the
physical or mental health of the woman; where
there is a substantial risk of serious foetal
handicap; or where continuing the pregnancy
would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman greater than if the pregnancy were
terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Between 1997 and 1998:
• the number of legal abortions on women
resident in England and Wales increased
by 4.2% to 177,332;
• abortions rose by 11% in the under 20
age-group, by 6% in the over 30 age-
group, but by only 1% in the 20 to 29
age-group;
• abortions carried out under the NHS
increased by 6% to 131,372, while non-
NHS abortions decreased by 1% to
45,960. NHS abortions represented 74%
of legal abortions on women resident in
England and Wales; and
• the overall abortion rate for women
resident in England and Wales rose to
13.8 abortions for every 1,000 women
aged 14 to 49, compared with a rate of
13.3 in 1997, while in Scotland it grew to
11.4 abortions for every 1,000 women
residents aged 15 to 44.
Substance Misuse
Drug Misuse
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem, and the Government is
making the fight against such misuse a
priority. It has reviewed its anti-drugs work
and has drawn up a new drugs strategy for the
UK (see p. 215). The health departments are
contributing to the new strategy through their
responsibilities for treatment, policy and
publicising public health messages on
prevention and reducing harm. Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own
distinctive strategies; these too have been

HEALTH SERVICES
under review. In Scotland where the review is
complete, the enhanced drugs strategy
Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in
Partnership sets out a comprehensive
programme of action covering all service areas,
with specific objectives and action priorities.
In Wales the National Assembly will refocus
the existing Drug and Alcohol Strategy
Forward Together.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse
is funded by several government departments.
The Government is advised on matters
relating to drug misuse and connected social
problems by the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs (in Scotland the Scottish
Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse and in
Wales the Substance Misuse Advisory Panel).
Prevention
As part of the Government’s anti-drugs
strategy, a new Drugs Prevention Advisory
Service (DPAS) was set up in April 1999 (see
p. 216). This replaced the Home Office Drugs
Prevention Initiative which had provided
funding for local drugs prevention teams in 12
areas of England.
The new DPAS works with Drug Action
Teams in England to encourage good drugs
prevention practice, based on available
evidence, and to assist in developing
appropriate demonstration programmes.
There are nine regional teams, covering the
whole of England.
In Wales a Strategic Prevention Action
Plan on Drugs and Alcohol has been
published and is currently being evaluated.
The Welsh Drug and Alcohol Unit will
monitor the implementation of the Plan.
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in England
and Wales to provide in-service training for
teachers involved in drugs prevention work in
schools. As part of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales (see chapter 10), children
in primary and secondary schools receive
education on the dangers of drug misuse. In
Scotland, education authorities are encouraged
to address health education including drug
education within a comprehensive programme
of personal and social education.
Government publicity campaigns have
been run since 1985 to persuade young people
not to take drugs, and to advise parents,
teachers and other professionals on how to
recognise and combat the problem. A wide
range of materials are used, including targeted
press and radio advertising and drug
educational literature. In Wales the Welsh
Drug and Alcohol Unit has developed a media
strategy in consultation with national
broadcasters and press.
UK National Drugs Helpline
A national drugs and solvents telephone
helpline provides 24-hour free confidential
advice, counselling and information
throughout the UK to anyone concerned
about the health implications of drugs or
solvent misuse. The telephone number is
0800 77 66 00.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Treatment for drug dependence includes:
specialist in-patient and residential
detoxification and rehabilitation; substitute
prescribing services; community drug
dependency services; needle and syringe
exchange schemes to combat the spread of
HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne infections;
advice and counselling; and after-care and
support services. An increasing number of
GPs treat drug misusers, but only a limited
number of doctors are licensed to prescribe
certain controlled drugs to them, such as
heroin and cocaine. However, any doctor may
prescribe methadone as a substitute drug for
drug misusers. All doctors must notify the
authorities of any patient they consider to be
addicted to certain controlled drugs.
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with, and complement, health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services,
including residential facilities, for example, are
provided by many voluntary organisations.
The total amount available to health
authorities in England for drug treatment
services in 1999-2000 is £53.2 million. In
addition, a grant is payable each year to local
authorities to enable them to support voluntary
201
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
organisations providing services to drug and
alcohol misusers. In Scotland, million is
being made available to health boards in
1999-2000 for the support of drug treatment
services. Additional funding has also been made
available to fund alternatives to prosecution and
imprisonment for drug misusing offenders.
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and professionals about the dangers
and signs of misuse, and, where practicable,
restricting the sales of solvent-based liquefied
gas and aerosol products to young people.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law. From October
1999 it will be an offence in the UK to sell
butane lighter refills to people under 18; these
refills are implicated in more than 50% of
deaths from solvent abuse.
The DH funds a hospital-based unit in
London to collect and publish annual
mortality statistics associated with solvent
misuse. The latest available statistics show
that the number of deaths has risen from 69 in
1995 to 73 in 1997, when solvent misuse
accounted for one in 50 of all deaths among
teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90% of the adult
population. While the vast majority drink
sensibly and safely, alcohol misuse does cause
preventable illness and social problems, and is
a factor in many accidents.
The most widely accepted estimate of the
cost of alcohol misuse in England and Wales is
£2.1 billion a year. Between 9 and 15 million
working days each year are thought to be lost
through'alcohol-related absence, while up to
40,000 deaths a year are estimated to be
alcohol-related.
The Government seeks to tackle alcohol-
related problems through a co-ordinated
programme of action across government
The Government is preparing a new
strategy to tackle alcohol misuse in
England. Its broad aims are:
• to encourage people who drink to do
so sensibly in line with guidance, so
as to avoid alcohol-related problems;
• to protect individuals and
communities from anti-social and
criminal behaviour related to alcohol
misuse; and
• to provide services of proven
effectiveness that enable people to
overcome their alcohol misuse
problems.
The Government intends to publish the
strategy, after public consultation, early in
the year 2000.
New strategies are also envisaged in
Wales, where there is a combined Drug
and Alcohol Strategy, and in Scotland,
where developing the strategy will be the
responsibility of the Scottish Advisory
Committee on Alcohol Misuse.
departments, and involving health and local
authorities, the voluntary and private sectors,
employers, the police and criminal justice
system, and the alcohol industry.
Part of the funds allocated to the Health
Education Authority (see p. 205) is for
promoting sensible drinking in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in other
parts of Britain. ‘Drinkline’ provides
confidential telephone advice about alcohol
problems and services in England and Wales.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS includes in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and some specialised alcohol treatment units.
Primary care teams and voluntary
organisations providing treatment and
rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England, Alcohol Concern plays a prominent
role in improving services for problem
drinkers and their families; increasing public
202
HEALTH SERVICES
awareness of alcohol misuse; and improving
training for professional and voluntary
workers. The Scottish Council on Alcohol has
a similar role in Scotland.
A report, Reducing Alcohol Related Harm in
Northern Ireland, was published in June 1999
and is being considered by the Department of
Health and Social Services (NI), with a view
to formulating a strategy for the Province.
Communicable Diseases
Health authorities/health boards have a key
responsibility for prevention and control of
outbreaks of infectious disease, basing closely
with colleagues in environmental health
departments of local authorities. They are
assisted by the Public Health Laboratory
Service, which aims to protect the population
from infection through the detection,
diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and control
of communicable diseases in England and
Wales. Similar facilities are provided in
Scotland by the Scottish Centre for Infection
and Environmental Health and, in Northern
Ireland, by the Communicable Disease
Surveillance Centre, the Northern Ireland
Public Health Laboratory and other hospital
microbiology laboratories.
Immunisation
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, whooping
cough and haemophilus influenzae type B
infection (‘Hib’). Immunisation is not
compulsory. Parents are provided with
information about the safety and efficacy of
vaccines and are encouraged to have their
children immunised. Immunisations are
mainly given by GPs and their practice nurses.
Annual immunisation rates are now at their
highest ever levels—for example, the uptake
of diphtheria, tetanus and polio immunisation
by the age of two in 1997-98 was 96%. The
incidence of such childhood diseases is at its
lowest ever level. Since the introduction of the
Hib vaccine in 1992, Hib meningitis has been
almost completely eliminated in young-
children. A new vaccine to protect against
meningococcaal Group C has been developed,
with DH funding, and is to be introduced into
the immunisation programme from autumn
1999. The UK will be the first country in the
world to use this vaccine.
HIV/AIDS
The latest figures from the Public Health
Laboratory Service show that to the end of
December 1998 there were a total of 16,028
cases of AIDS and 33,764 cases of HIV reported
in the UK. Of these, 90% were from England
with HIV infection rates remaining higher in
London than elsewhere in the UK. Although
the UK has a relatively low prevalence of
HIV/AIDS as a result of sustained public
education and health campaigns, about 3,000
new infections continue to be reported each
year. The use of combination drug therapy is
delaying progression of the disease, and
mortality in 1998 had fallen to almost a quarter
of that in 1995—96. As a consequence, the
number of individuals within the population
infected with HIV is increasing. During 1998
there were 16,891 people with HIV in contact
with the statutory health services.
Those most vulnerable to HIV infection
remain homosexual/bisexual men, injecting
drug users and people from high prevalence
communities, currently those from sub-
Saharan Africa. Although the UK has not
seen a large-scale spread of HIV to the
heterosexual population, the rate in pregnant
women giving birth in London remains
relatively high at one in 500. The
Government has introduced a range of
initiatives to inform pregnant women about
having an HIV test as an integral part of their
antenatal care. Most HIV-infected pregnant
women accept measures to decrease the risk
of passing the infection to their babies. Health
authorities are aiming to achieve a reduction
in the number of children with HIV by
around 80% by 2002.
In England NHS funding in 1999-2000 for
HIV/AIDS treatment and care to health
authorities amounts to £234 million, with a
further £53.4 million for HIV prevention. A
consultation paper on a proposed new
government strategy for HIV/AIDS is
expected by spring 2000.
203
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Some £15.5 million has been made
available in 1999-2000 to local authorities as a
contribution towards the cost of community
care services for people with severe HI\ and
AIDS. In addition, over £1.6 million has been
made available to voluntary organisations who
provide care information and support services
to people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.
Strategies by the Government to prevent
transmission include:
• placing contracts for national health HIV/
AIDS health promotion work for both the
general population and groups at risk;
• providing information on antenatal HIV
testing which helps pregnant women to
reach an informed decision; and
• the National AIDS Helpline, which
provides confidential information and
advice on all aspects of HIV and AIDS.
A concerted approach is being maintained,
spanning government, the NHS, local
authorities and the voluntary sector
(including women’s groups, religious
communities and organisations working with
ethnic minorities).
Tuberculosis
The UK has an excellent record of tuberculosis
(TB) control. Notifications of TB are at the
relatively low level of around 6,500 cases a year,
compared with nearly 50,000 in 1950. These
levels have been achieved and maintained
through an immunisation programme, treatment
of identified cases and screening of their close
contacts, screening and treatment for
immigrants from countries with a high
prevalence of TB and active surveillance.
However, there has been a worldwide
resurgence in TB that is having a small but
important impact on trends in the UK, although
small increases in the annual number of cases
between 1987 and 1993 have since levelled out.
The Government has taken steps to strengthen
the surveillance, prevention and control of TB,
including drug-resistant TB, within the UK. A
detailed survey of notifications is in progress and
is expected to provide important information on
trends in incidence.
Cancer Care
Care and treatment of cancer forms a
significant part of the NHS’s work,
consuming nearly 7% of its total budget. A
framework for the future development of
cancer services, announced in 1995,
recommended that services should be
organised at three levels, with primary care
seen as the initial focus of care; cancer units
created in many local hospitals of a sufficient
size to support a multidisciplinary team with
the expertise and facilities to treat commoner
cancers; and cancer centres situated in larger
hospitals to treat less common cancers and to
support smaller cancer units by providing
services not available in all local hospitals.
Health authorities/health boards are now
planning to implement these changes.
The Government is committed to improving
the provision and availability of high-quality
cancer services and is directing savings achieved
from cuts in the cost of the NHS internal
market (see p. 188) into patient care.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in the UK: some 14,000 women die
from it each year; and one in ten women will
develop it. The UK was the first country in
the European Union to introduce a
nationwide breast screening programme,
under which women aged between 50 and 64
are invited for mammography (breast X-ray)
every three years by computerised call and
recall systems. Women aged 65 and over are
entitled to request screening. In 1997-98 in
England:
• 64% of women aged 50 to 64 invited for
screening were screened;
• 1.2 million women of all ages were
screened within the programme; and
• 6,914 cases of cancer were diagnosed
among women screened.
The nationwide cervical screening
programme aims to reduce death from cancer
of the cervix by inviting women aged between
20 and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a
smear test at least once every five years.
204
HEALTH SERVICES
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve targets of 50% and 80% for the
uptake of smear tests. The Government
estimates that almost all GPs now receive
these payments for meeting cervical screening
targets. In England over 85% of women
invited to attend were screened over the last
five years. In 1997-98 in Scotland 87% of
women invited to attend were screened over
the last 5'/a years.
Deaths from cervical cancer in England and
Wales have fallen since the programme began,
dropping from 1,942 in 1988 to 1,155 in 1998,
and in Scotland from 191 in 1988 to 145 in 1998.
Health Education
In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland
responsibility for health education lies with
separate health education authorities, which
work alongside the national health
departments. These authorities are part of the
NHS. They are the Health Education
Authority; the Health Education Board for
Scotland; and the Health Promotion Agency
for Northern Ireland. Their aims are:
• to provide information and advice about
health directly to members of the public;
• to support other organisations and health
professionals who provide health
education to members of the public; and
• to advise the Government and other
policy makers on health education and
promotion.
In Wales a new health promotion division has
been established in the National Assembly for
Wales, with responsibility for health promotion
policy and strategy, and the development and
delivery of national programmes and initiatives
to promote health and well-being.
The health education authorities and the
National Assembly for Wales health
promotion division undertake a range of
programmes and initiatives, which focus on
improving health and inequality. These
include initiatives on: coronary heart disease,
stroke, cancer, smoking, diet, accidents, drug
abuse, alcohol misuse, physical activity, sexual
health and HIV/AIDS, mental health and
tackling inequalities in health.
Almost all NHS health authorities/health
boards have their own health education
service, which works closely with health
professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to
determine the most suitable local programmes.
Nutrition
Despite the growing public awareness in recent
years of the importance of a healthy diet, the
proportion of adults who are obese or overweight
has increased. In 1997,20% of women and 17%
of men aged 16 and over in England were
classified as obese, compared with 8% and 6%
respectively in 1980 in Great Britain.
Medical research has shown that a diet which
is low in fats, especially saturates, and rich in
fruit, vegetables and starchy foods contributes
to good health and can reduce the risk of certain
serious illnesses, such as coronary heart disease,
stroke, and some cancers.
The Committee on the Medical Aspects of
Food and Nutrition Policy published its report
Nutritional Aspects of the Development of Cancer
in 1998. It noted that research suggests that diet
might contribute to about one-third of all
cancers. Its main recommendations are
consistent with the Government’s healthy eating
advice to the effect that a healthy and balanced
diet is one which is varied and rich in fruit and
vegetables and dietary fibre. The report also
underlined the importance of maintaining a
healthy body weight throughout adult life.
The major supermarket groups and most
food manufacturers have introduced
voluntary labelling schemes indicating the
energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate content
of food. Nutrition labelling is compulsory on
products for which a nutritional claim is
made.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health provides public health
protection through control of the physical
environment—atmospheric pollution and
noise; contaminated land, food and water;
waste management; housing; occupational
health and safety; communicable diseases; and
statutory nuisances. In the UK no single
205
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
government department is responsible for
environmental health as a whole, although the
DH advises other government departments on
the health implications of their policies.
Environmental health services are provided by
local government.
Professionally trained environmental health
officers are employed principally by local
authorities. They are concerned with
inspection, health promotion and regulation.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
established by the Medical Research Council
(see p. 436), is concerned mainly with research
and management of research into the hazards to
which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
DH, the National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland
Department of Health and Social Services
have established National Focus, a unit based
in Cardiff, to co-ordinate work on responses to
chemical incidents and surveillance of health
effects of environmental chemicals. A major
research programme to find out more about
the health effects of chemical pollutants in the
environment was announced in 1998.
Accidents
The Department of Trade and Industry records
home and leisure accidents needing hospital
treatment. Data for 1997 show that every five
hours, one older person dies from an accidental
fall in the home. Altogether around 1.2 million
people in the UK go to a hospital casualty
department each year as a result of an accidental
fall. Around 43,000 people experience falls from
ladders each year, and burns from barbecues are
thought to affect about 500 people.
Food Safety
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to
sell or supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly labelled.
The Act covers a broad range of commercial
activities related to food production, to the
sources from which it is derived, such as crops
and animals, and to articles which come into
contact with food. There are also more detailed
regulations which apply to all types of food and
drink and their ingredients. Local authorities
are responsible for enforcing food law in two
main areas: trading standards officers deal with
the labelling of food, its composition and most
cases of chemical contamination; environmental
health officers deal with hygiene, with cases of
microbiological contamination of foods, and
with any food which for any reason is unfit for
human consumption. See p. 451 for details of
the proposed new independent Food Standards
Agency.
CJD and Public Health
CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a rare
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in
humans. In 1996 the Government announced
that the National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh had identified a previously
unrecognised form of the disease, variant CJD
(vCJD).1 The Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) concluded that
the most likely explanation, in the absence of
any credible alternative, was that these cases
were linked to exposure to BSE (see p. 451)
before the introduction of the specified bovine
offals ban in 1989. Since 1996 SEAC has
continued to review emerging scientific
findings. In 1997 SEAC considered the results
of two separate experiments and concluded
that they provided convincing evidence that
the agent that causes BSE is the same as that
which causes vCJD. However, these results
did not provide information about the route of
infection. In light of the increased number of
cases of vCJD, the Committee has concluded
that vCJD is an acquired prion disease caused
by exposure to a BSE-like agent.
The direct connection of BSE as the cause
of vCJD is not absolutely proved scientifically,
but to safeguard public health the Government
is providing substantial additional funding for
research into CJD and BSE, including the
work carried out at the National CJD
Surveillance Unit, which monitors the
incidence of the disease.
An independent public inquiry was set up in
1998 to establish and review the history of the
1 Sometimes referred to as new variant CJD (nvCJD).
206
HEALTH SERVICES
emergence and identification of BSE and vCJD
in the UK; it is due to report by 31 March
2000. (See chapter 27 for details of government
measures to control the spread of BSE.)
Safety of Medicines
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency or the Medicines
Control Agency may be sold or supplied to the
public. Marketing authorisations are issued
following scientific assessment on the basis of
safety, quality and efficacy.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching; the NHS provides hospital and
community facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, and the community, with a further
year’s experience in a hospital. For a dentist,
five years’ training at a dental school is
required plus satisfactory completion of one
year’s mandatory vocational training before
working as a principal in the General Dental
Services of the NHS is permitted.
Following a review of specialist medical
training, the Government has introduced a
new specialist registrar grade, which reduces
from three to two the number of specialist
training grades, and will increasingly allow
doctors to complete their training at an earlier
age. This change, together with other policies
to increase consultant numbers and reduce
junior doctors’ hours, are expected to increase
the amount of service provided to NHS
patients by consultants.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
and, for dentists, the General Dental Council.
The main professional associations are the
British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors
Nursing students undertake the pre¬
registration Diploma in Higher Education
(Project 2000) programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well as care of the sick
and enables students to work either in
hospitals or in the community. The
programme lasts three years and consists of
periods of college study combined with
practical experience in hospital and in the
community.
Midwifery education programmes for
registered general/adult nurses take 18
months, but the direct entry programme lasts
three years. Health visitors are registered
adult nurses who have a further specialist
qualification in health visiting. District
nurses are registered adult nurses who have a
further specialist qualification in district
nursing and care for clients in the
community.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions. Four National Boards—
for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that
training courses meet Central Council
requirements as to their type, content and
standard. The Government intends to bring
forward proposals for legislation to replace
the existing structure with a single
regulatory body. The main professional
associations are the Royal College of
Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives and
the Community Practitioners and Health
Visitors Association.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of
pharmaceutical chemists may practise as
pharmacists. Registration requires four
years’ training in a school of pharmacy,
followed by one year’s practical experience
in a community or hospital pharmacy
approved for training by regulatory bodies
for the profession—the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern
Ireland.
207
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Optometrists (Opthalmic Opticians)
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight; training for the former takes four years,
including a year of practical experience under
supervision. Dispensing opticians take a two-
year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience, or follow a part-time day-release
course while employed with an optician.
Other Health Professions
The Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine and its professional boards regulate
the initial training and subsequent practice of
nine health professions: chiropodists;
radiographers; orthoptists; physiotherapists;
occupational therapists; dietitians; medical
laboratory scientific officers; prosthetists and
orthotists; and arts therapists (art, drama and
music therapists).
The boards are responsible for promoting
high standards of professional education and
conduct among members, approving training
institutions, qualifications and courses, and
maintaining registers of those who have
qualified for state registration—state
registration in these professions is mandatory
for employment in health authorities, Trusts
and local authority social services. These criteria
will shortly apply to prosthetists and orthotists,
and to arts therapists. Measures to extend state
registration to the professions of speech and
language therapists, clinical scientists and
paramedics came into force in June 1999.
The Government also intends to bring
forward proposals for legislation to reform the
Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act
1960 to improve protection to the public
through the statutory regulation of key groups
of health professions.
Dental therapists and dental hygienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
two-to-three-year training course and dental
hygienists take a course lasting two years; both
carry out specified dental work under the
supervision of a registered dentist.
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see p. 130)
have been developed for healthcare support
workers, ambulance personnel, operating
department practitioners, physiological
measurement technicians, and administrative
and clerical staff.
Complementary Medicine
Complementary medicine (or
complementary therapies) can cover a range
of therapies and practices, the best known
being osteopathy, chiropractic,
homoeopathy, acupuncture and herbalism.
With the exception of homoeopathy,
complementary medicine is usually available
only outside the NHS. There is a wide
variety of regulatory and professional
arrangements ranging from statutory
regulation to little or no regulation at all.
The Government is providing funding to
encourage professional self-regulation.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Economic Area (EEA—see p. 81) have
special health arrangements under which
EEA nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive emergency treatment,
either free or at a reduced cost, during visits
to other EEA countries. Treatment is
provided, in most cases, on production of a
valid Form El 11 which, in the UK, people
normally obtain from a post office before
travelling. There are also arrangements for
people who go to another EEA country
specifically for medical care, or who require
continuing treatment for a pre-existing
condition. Unless falling into an exempt
category (for example, foreign students) or
covered by an appropriate EC form, visitors
to the UK are generally expected to pay for
routine, non-emergency treatment, or if the
purpose of their visit is to seek specific
medical treatment. The UK also has a
number of separate bilateral agreements with
certain other countries, including Australia
and New Zealand.

The first phase of reform of the civil justice system in England and Wales was
implemented in April 1999. The Access to Justice Act 1999, which received
Royal Assent in July, contains radical reforms to legal aid and the provision of
legal services. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, also enacted
in July, includes new measures to ensure that young people take greater
responsibility for their behaviour and to provide better protection for
vulnerable witnesses in criminal trials.
Introduction
The United Kingdom does not have a single
legal system. Instead, England and Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own
systems, with considerable differences in law,
judicial procedure and court structure. There
is, however, substantial similarity on many
points and a large volume of modern
legislation applies throughout the UK. In all
three systems there is a common distinction
between criminal law and civil law.
Criminal and Civil Law
Laws can be classified as either criminal or
civil. Criminal law deals with wrongs affecting
the community for which a prosecution may
be brought in the criminal courts. Civil law is
about deciding disputes between two or more
parties—individuals, companies or other
organisations—and for providing a means of
legal scrutiny of the actions of public bodies.
The purpose of civil proceedings is not to
punish, but to obtain compensation or some
other appropriate remedy, although in
England and Wales the payment of damages
may sometimes have a punitive element.
The distinction between civil and criminal
matters is imprecise. Courts may be classified
as criminal courts and civil courts, but in
England and Wales and Northern Ireland
magistrates’ courts have both a civil and a
criminal jurisdiction as have the sheriff courts
in Scotland. Conduct may amount to both a
civil and a criminal wrong. However, the court
of trial and the rules of procedure and
evidence will usually differ in civil and
criminal cases.
Increasingly, civil remedies and the
criminal process are being used together to
deal with social problems. The Crime and
Disorder Act 1998 has introduced an anti¬
social behaviour order, which is a civil order
210
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
designed to prevent continued criminal and
sub-criminal anti-social acts. Breach of this
civil order constitutes a criminal offence.
Other recent examples of this overlap are
orders relating to protection from harassment,
and sex offender orders, designed to prevent
behaviour by sex offenders that poses a serious
risk to the public.
Sources of Law
Statutes passed by Parliament are the ultimate
source of law. There are no legal limits on what
may be done by Act of Parliament, although a
legal duty exists to comply with European
Community (EC) law. A statute may also confer
power on a minister, local authority or other
executive body to make delegated legislation.
Provided that the person exercising the power
keeps within what Parliament intended,
delegated legislation is equivalent to statute. A
court cannot declare a statute to be invalid (but
see the European Convention on Human
Rights—below), and a statute may reverse a
decision by the courts with which Parliament
disagrees. Parliament can repeal an Act, wholly
or partly, replacing it with new provisions.
Sometimes this will follow recommendations
for law reform from an official committee, or
from the Law Commission, a statutory body
established to examine and report on law reform
matters. Some Acts create new law, while others
consolidate the law by drawing together existing
law on a given topic.
Modern statutes are usually brought into
effect by an Order made by a minister of the
Crown. This allows provisions to be brought
into effect when it is practical to do so. The
operation of a statutory provision may be tested
by the use of a pilot scheme. Occasionally, if
circumstances or policies change, provisions are
not brought into effect, and may be repealed.
Many key areas of law have, over the
centuries, developed through the decisions of
the courts. This is known as common law. The
doctrine of binding precedent means that
decisions of higher courts bind those courts
lower down in the court hierarchy. This ensures
consistency of judicial approach. Judges give
reasons for their decisions, and principles of law
are stated, developed and modified. The
common law can develop new rules, or modify
existing ones, but judges generally take great
care not to develop the common law in ways
involving policy choices best left to Parliament.
When the legality of government action is being
tested, a court will try to ensure that it is not
overstepping its proper role; it should avoid
examining the merits of the particular action or
policy being challenged.
European Sources
EC law, which applies in the UK by virtue of
its membership of the European Union (see
p. 69), derives from the EC treaties, from the
Community legislation adopted under them,
and from the decisions of the European Court
of Justice. That court has the ultimate
authority, under the Treaty of Rome, to
decide points of Community law. Where a
point arises before the UK court, it may refer
the point of law to the Court of Justice for it to
decide. Sometimes a court is obliged to make a
reference to the European Court.
The decisions of the Court of Justice do not
directly bind British courts, but the UK is
under treaty obligations to uphold
Community law. Consequently, British courts
are obliged to apply European law, even at the
expense of not applying the provision of an
Act of Parliament. If a rule of statute or
common law is incompatible with Community
law, it is Community law that will be applied
by a UK court.
European Convention on Human Rights
The European Convention on Human Rights is
an international treaty containing a statement of
some basic human rights, such as right to life,
prohibition of torture, right to a fair trial,
respect for private and family life, and freedom
of expression and assembly. These rights have
to be balanced against competing rights and
public interests (for example public health,
public safety and security).
Although the Convention was ratified by the
UK in 1951, it is not part of UK domestic law.
However, the judgments of the European Court
of Human Rights are binding in international
law on the UK, and successive governments
have responded to adverse findings by amending
domestic law or practice where necessary.
211
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Human Rights Act 1998, which will be
brought fully into effect in October 2000,
requires all public authorities, including
courts of law, to act in accordance with the
Convention rights. It enables individuals to
rely on those rights in any legal proceedings
and to bring a claim against a public authority
which has acted incompatibly with those
rights. The Act requires a court to give effect
to legislation, as far as possible, in a way which
is compatible with Convention rights. A court
cannot declare invalid an Act of Parliament
which is incompatible with the Convention,
but the higher courts may make a declaration
of incompatibility, which will trigger a special
procedure enabling a minister to change the
legislation in question quickly to make it
compatible with Convention rights.
Under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish
Parliament and Executive may not exercise
their powers in a way which is incompatible
with any of the Convention rights.
Personnel of the Law
The law is enforced by judicial officers,
ranging from judges in the House of Lords
and the superior courts to stipendiary and lay
justices who, together with juries in certain
cases, are responsible for deciding disputed
cases. The law also depends on officers of the
court who have general or specialised
functions of an administrative, and sometimes
of a judicial, nature in the courts to which they
are attached.
Courts are presided over by judges and
magistrates. Judges are legally qualified, being
appointed from the ranks of practising
barristers and advocates or solicitors. They
have independence of office, and can be
removed only in rare and limited circumstances
involving misconduct or incapacity. They are
not subject to ministerial control or direction.
Lay magistrates in England and Wales, and
justices of the peace in Scotland, are trained in
order to give them sufficient knowledge of the
law, including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing. In
Northern Ireland members of a lay panel who
serve in juvenile courts undertake training
courses. Lay magistrates are advised on the
law by magistrates’ clerks. The Lord
Chancellor appoints lay magistrates from
names submitted by local advisory
committees; district court justices in Scotland
are appointed by the First Minister on the
recommendation of local justices of the peace
advisory committees. Some courts have one or
more full-time, legally qualified magistrates
(stipendiaries). In Northern Ireland, resident
magistrates, drawn from practising solicitors
or barristers, have powers similar to those of
stipendiary magistrates. There are over 30,000
lay magistrates and 90 stipendiary magistrates
in England and Wales, and 4,000 justices of
the peace in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
there are 17 resident magistrates and 23
deputy (part-time) magistrates.
Although people are free to conduct their
own cases if they so wish, barristers—or
advocates in Scotland—and solicitors
generally represent the interests of parties to a
dispute, and it is rare for an accused person in
a criminal case to be unrepresented. There are
over 9,000 practising barristers in England
and Wales and around 71,640 practising
solicitors. Scotland has about 400 practising
advocates and some 8,250 solicitors; in
Northern Ireland there are about 450
barristers. Barristers practise as individuals,
but join a group of other barristers, in
Chambers. Advocates practise as individuals
and do not operate from Chambers as
barristers do. Solicitors usually operate in
partnership with other solicitors. Large firms
of solicitors will comprise not only qualified
staff, but also legal executives and support
staff. Certain legal functions may be
performed by non-lawyers—licensed
conveyancers can act in conveyancing matters
(the transfer of interests in land).
Traditionally, rights of audience in the
higher courts—the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, House of Lords, Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court, High
Court of Justiciary (Scotland) and Court of
Session (Scotland)—have mostly been limited
to barristers and advocates, who are regarded
as specialist court pleaders. The power to
extend those rights of audience has existed
since 1990, including in some circumstances
the power to extend them to persons beside
solicitors, barristers and advocates (such as
212
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
non-qualified legal staff known as legal
executives). In 1998 the Government proposed
that all qualified barristers, advocates and
solicitors should have rights of audience in the
higher courts, provided they meet relevant
experience and training requirements. This
would include solicitors directly employed by
government departments, the Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS) and local authorities.
These proposals will be implemented under the
Access to Justice Act 1999.
The two branches of the profession have
separate professional bodies: the Bar Council
for barristers (in Scotland, the Faculty of
Advocates); and the Law Society (or the Law
Society of Scotland) for solicitors. The
profession is self-regulating, with the
professional bodies exercising disciplinary
control over their members.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales conducts investigations
into the way professional bodies handle
complaints against barristers, solicitors and
licensed conveyancers. The Scottish Legal
Services Ombudsman performs a similar task.
Measures against Crime
Crime Statistics
There are two main measures of the scale of
crime in the UK—the recording of crimes by
the police, and periodic surveys which ask
representative samples of the population about
their experiences of crime.
Recorded Crime
In 1997, in England and Wales:
• overall recorded crime totalled almost 4.6
million offences (see Table 14.1), a
decrease of 8.7% compared to 1996;
• the overall clear-up rate was 28%;
• about 91% of offences recorded by the
police were against property, while 8%
involved violence; and
• vehicle crime accounted for about 24% of
all recorded crimes.
In 1998 the Government amended the way
notifiable offences are recorded in England
Table 14.1: Notifiable Crimes
Recorded by the Police in England
and Wales, 1997 thousands
Offence Group 1997
Violence against the person 250.8
Sexual offences 33.2
Burglary 1,015.0
Robbery 63.1
Theft and handling
stolen goods 2,165.0
Fraud and forgery 134.4
Criminal damage 877.0
Other 59.8
Total 4,598.3
Source: Home Office
and Wales, changing the counting rules so that
the number of crimes corresponds more
closely to the number of victims. The first
figures under the new rules will be for the
period April 1998 to March 1999 and should
be published in October 1999. The 1997
figures reproduced above, using the previous
recording method, represented the fifth
consecutive yearly fall in overall crime.
In Scotland figures show that there were
432,000 crimes recorded by the police in the
1998 calendar year. This represents a 3%
increase on the 1997 figure and is the first rise
in recorded crime in Scotland in seven years.
The overall crime clear-up rate rose to 41%.
Recorded crime in Northern Ireland in
1997 totalled over 62,200 offences,
representing a fall of 9% on the 1996 level.
About 78% of recorded offences were against
property. The overall clear-up rate was 31%.
Crime Surveys
The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a large
household survey first conducted in 1982,
which has a sample representative of people
aged 16 and over and of private households in
England and Wales. The BCS asks
respondents whether they have experienced
certain personal and household crimes in the
preceding year, regardless of whether or not
they reported the incident to the police. The
survey therefore provides a measure of those
crimes not reported to, or recorded by, the
213
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The following figures relating to 1900, for
indictable offences known to the police, are
from the official Judicial Statistics, England
and Wales. While they cannot be compared
directly with current statistics, given the
changes in recording practices and in
population levels, they still give an
illustration of the extent, and type, of
crime at that time.
Offences against the person 3,490
Offences against property,
with violence 7,764
Offences against property,
without violence 63,604
Malicious injury to property
(for example, arson,
criminal damage) 444
Forgery and counterfeiting 486
Other offences 2,146
Total 77,934
police. It also provides a measure of the
underlying trend in crime that is not affected
by changes in the public’s willingness to
report incidents to the police. The survey can
also show the types of people most at risk of
victimisation of particular types of crime, and
what people think of the police and judiciary,
and about issues such as fear of crime. The
1998 BCS estimated that there were 16.4
million crimes in 1997 (an overall fall of 14%
since the last survey which covered crime in
1995). There was a 7% decrease in burglaries
and a 19% fall in vehicle theft between 1995
and 1997; the number of violent crimes also
fell by 17%.
The 1996 Scottish Crime Survey estimated
that just under 1 million crimes were
committed against individuals and private
households in Scotland during 1995. This was
8% fewer than the number estimated in the
1993 survey.
Crime Reduction
Reducing crime, particularly youth crime, is
central to the Government’s criminal justice
policy. Within the Home Office, the Crime
Reduction Unit aims to encourage and
develop strategies and tactics to this end. The
unit supports the police crime reduction effort
through its Crime Prevention College (in
North Yorkshire), which is the national centre
for training police officers in prevention skills.
Significant crime reduction initiatives
include:
• a £250 million Crime Reduction
Programme, announced by the Home
Secretary in 1998, which focuses on
reducing burglary and promoting
targeted policing;
• a £150 million investment in closed-
circuit television (CCTV) surveillance
systems in public areas such as housing
estates, shopping centres, railway stations
and car parks;
• Neighbourhood Watch schemes, in which
residents look out for suspicious activity in
their area and inform the police;
• crime prevention panels, which meet
regularly to examine crime problems in
their area and to suggest practical solutions;
• youth action groups, encouraging young
people to tackle problems relevant to
them—for example bullying, vandalism
or drug misuse; and
• partnerships set up under the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998, which bring together
the police, local authorities and other
relevant agencies to develop strategies for
dealing with local crime problems.
There is a Crime Prevention Council in
Scotland and a Crime Prevention Panel in
Northern Ireland.
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 creates a
framework designed to keep individuals,
particularly young offenders, out of the
criminal justice system, and to ensure timely
action to prevent reoffending. Particular
emphasis is placed on preventing offending
behaviour by persons under 18 (see p. 225).
The Act requires police services and local
authorities in England and Wales to develop
statutory partnerships for crime prevention
214
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
and the promotion of community safety. The
partnerships must examine local levels of
crime and disorder, consult local people and
then set targets for tackling the problems that
have been identified. The statutory provisions
do not, however, apply to Scotland, where
police forces and local authorities already
enter into such partnerships.
Prohibitive anti-social behaviour orders may
be applied to individuals or groups whose
threatening and disruptive conduct harasses
the local community. Anyone in breach of such
an order is guilty of a criminal offence. The
Act also empowers the courts to grant an order
against convicted sex offenders, prohibiting
behaviour which causes concern for public
safety (for example, loitering near schools).
Anti-social behaviour orders and sex offender
orders are applicable throughout the UK.
Control of Weapons
The UK has strict legislative controls on
firearms. The police license the possession of
firearms and have powers to regulate their
safekeeping and movement. A ban on the
private ownership of machine guns, high-
powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons has been extended to include all
handguns. It is illegal to manufacture, sell or
import certain weapons such as
knuckledusters. Penalties relating to the
carrying of knives have been increased.
Helping Victims and Witnesses
In England and Wales a government-funded
organisation, Victim Support, provides
practical help and emotional support to
victims of crime with the help of 16,000
volunteers. It also runs the Witness Service,
which advises victims and other witnesses
attending Crown Court centres (and is
developing similar services in magistrates’
courts). Broadly similar support schemes
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In 1998 the Government published a report
(Speaking up for Justice) on improving the
treatment of witnesses (including children)
who become involved in the criminal justice
system in England and Wales. The report
made 78 recommendations to give greater
protection to vulnerable witnesses and those
subject to intimidation, from the initial crime
investigation stage through to the trial and
beyond. These included:
• a ban on cross-examination of victims of
rape and serious sexual assault by
defendants who are unrepresented in
court;
• live CCTV links and screens for
witnesses likely to be distressed by being
in court and facing defendants;
• video-recorded evidence for vulnerable
adults and recorded pre-trial cross-
examination for witnesses suffering from
mental or physical disabilities; and
• measures to help child witnesses give
evidence and understand questioning in
court.
Twenty-six of the report’s recommendations
required statutory force and have been included
in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence
Act 1999.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland may be eligible
for compensation from public funds under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to property.
Tackling Drug Misuse
The problem of drug misuse remains
formidable. Levels of drug seizures reveal the
increasing threat of a widening range of
trafficking routes to the UK against a
background of expanding global production.
In 1998 the Government’s UK Anti-Drugs
Co-ordinator assumed responsibility for co¬
ordinating the fight against illegal drugs in the
UK and drew up a ten-year national strategy
(Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain). This
cross-government strategy—focusing mainly
on England, but reflecting the UK and
international dimension of the problem—has
four main elements:
• helping young people resist drug misuse
in order to achieve their full potential in
society;
215
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• protecting communities from drug-
related anti-social and criminal
behaviour;
• enabling people to overcome drug
problems through treatment; and
• stifling the availability of illegal drugs on
the streets.
As part of the strategy, action is being taken
to:
• channel seized assets from drug dealers
into anti-drug work;
• provide appropriate drug education to all
children aged from 5-16;
• pilot drug treatment and testing orders
for offenders;1 and
• shift resources to preventing, rather than
reacting to, the problem.
The UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator’s first
annual report and action plan was published in
May 1999.
The Drugs Prevention Advisory Service
(DPAS) was launched in April 1999 (replacing
the previous Drugs Prevention Initiative) to
promote community-based drugs prevention
at local, regional and national level in line with
the objectives of the Government’s national
strategy. In particular, the DPAS provides
information, advice and support to local Drug
Action Teams (the bodies charged with local
implementation of the national strategy) to
encourage good drugs prevention practice
based on available and emerging evidence, and
promotes consistent and coherent prevention
policy across Government. DPAS teams have
been established in each of the nine
Government Regions in England (see p. 10).
Countering Terrorism
In the light of serious terrorist attacks that
have taken place in the UK, it is the
Government’s view that the ordinary criminal
law is not sufficient to deal with terrorism
1 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is introducing drug
treatment and testing orders throughout the UK for drug-
misusing offenders aged 16 and over. An order will include
a requirement that the offender submits to drug treatment
and testing under appropriate supervision.
effectively. The law has been supplemented
by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
Provisions) Act 1989 (PTA) and successive
Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
Acts (EPA), and most recently amended and
reinforced by the Criminal Justice (Terrorism
and Conspiracy) Act 1998 (see below).
The PTA has a UK-wide application while
the EPA applies only in Northern Ireland.
Both Acts are temporary and must be renewed
by Parliament each year. They are intended to
strike a balance between providing powers that
are necessary to protect the public and
safeguarding the rights of individuals. They
give the security forces wider powers to
question and arrest people suspected of
involvement in terrorism and to search
property, including vehicles.
The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and
Conspiracy) Act 1998 aims to underpin the
Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland
(see p. 16) by making it easier to secure the
conviction of members of proscribed
organisations which are not observing a
complete and unequivocal ceasefire. It also
makes it an offence to conspire in the UK to
commit terrorist or other serious offences in
another country.
The Government intends to rationalise and
modernise the temporary arrangements and,
in December 1998, published proposals for
permanent UK-wide counter-terrorism
legislation, including:
• the adoption of a new definition of
terrorism which will extend to domestic
as well as Irish and international
terrorism;
• the abolition of exclusion order powers;
• stronger powers for dealing with terrorist
fund-raising;
• a new judicial authority to consider
applications for extensions of detention
of terrorist suspects; and
• a review of the provisions of the Criminal
Tustice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act
1998.
Public consultation on these proposals
ended in March 1999, and the Government
intends to introduce legislation as soon as
parliamentary time allows.
216
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Police Service
Government ministers, together with police
authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for providing an effective and
efficient police service in the UK.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces, organised on a local
basis—43 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland and one (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary—RUC)2 in Northern Ireland.
The Metropolitan Police Service and the City
of Uondon force are responsible for policing
Uondon.
Police strength in England and Wales is about
127,000 (of which the Metropolitan Police
numbers around 26,000). There are some 14,800
officers in Scotland and 8,500 in the RUC. Each
force in Great Britain has volunteer special
constables who perform police duties in their
spare time, without pay, acting in support of
regular officers. They number about 20,000 in all.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities. In the 41
police areas outside Uondon, they normally
have 17 members—nine locally elected
councillors, three magistrates and five
independent members. The Home Secretary
is currently the police authority for the
Metropolitan Police District. However, the
Greater Uondon Authority (GUA) Bill (see
p. 9) will, subject to parliamentary approval,
create a new Metropolitan Police Authority
(MPA) from July 2000, the majority of whose
23 members would be elected representatives.
For the City of London Police Area, the
authority is the Common Council of the
Corporation of Uondon. Police authorities, in
consultation with the chief constables and
local community, set local policing objectives,
while the Government sets key objectives for
2 Legislation passed in 1998 provides for the continuance
of the RUC as the body of constables in Northern Ireland,
but introduces the concept of the Northern Ireland Police
Service to include all those staff under the day-to-day
management of the chief constable. Under the terms of the
Good Friday Agreement, an independent commission has
inquired into policing in Northern Ireland and its report was
published in September 1999 (see p. 18).
the police as a whole. The police authorities in
Scotland are composed of elected councillors.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
appoints the Police Authority.
Provincial police forces are headed by chief
constables (appointed by their police
authorities, with government approval), who
are responsible for the direction and control of
their forces and for the appointment,
promotion and discipline of all ranks below
assistant chief constable. On matters of
efficiency they are generally answerable to
their police authorities. The Commissioner of
the Metropolitan Police is appointed on the
recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Independent inspectors of constabulary
report on the efficiency and effectiveness of
police forces.
National Crime Bodies
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
(NCIS), which was put on an independent
statutory footing in 1998, has the leading role in
collecting and analysing criminal intelligence for
use by police forces and other law enforcement
agencies in the UK. It has a headquarters and
south-east regional office in Uondon, five other
regional offices in England and offices in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. NCIS co¬
ordinates the activities of the Security Services
in support of the law enforcement agencies
against organised crime, and liaises with the
International Criminal Police Organisation
(INTERPOU), which promotes international
co-operation between police forces. It also
provides the channel for communication
between the UK and EUROPOU (see p. 92).
In 1998 a National Crime Squad, with 1,400
officers, replaced six regional crime squads in
England and Wales. Its role is to prevent and
detect organised and serious crime across police
force and national boundaries and to support
provincial forces in their investigation of serious
crime. The Scottish Crime Squad performs the
same function in Scotland.
Information Systems
The Police Information Technology
Organisation is responsible for specifying and
procuring the delivery of national information
217
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
technology systems (such as the Police
National Computer) for the police service, and
for promoting the National Strategy for Police
Information Systems, which develops
common information technology applications
at force level.
The Police National Computer provides all
police forces in the UK with rapid 24-hour-a-
day access to operationally essential
information, particularly vehicle information.
Phoenix, the Criminal Justice Record Service,
gives the police direct on-line access to
national records of arrests, cautions, bail
decisions and convictions. In England and
Wales a national automated fingerprint
identification system, linked to the Police
National Computer, will be available to all
forces by the year 2001. In Scotland the
Scottish Criminal Records Office provides a
fully automated criminal and fingerprint
records service, and a project for the
integration of Scottish criminal justice
information systems is in progress.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is a
Home Office executive agency, providing
scientific support in the investigation of crime
and expert evidence to the courts. Its
customers include the police, the CPS,
Customs and Excise, coroners and defence
solicitors. The FSS serves all police forces in
England and Wales through six regional
laboratories. It also operates the national DNA
database, which provides intelligence
information to police forces by matching
DNA profiles taken from suspects to profiles
from samples left at the scenes of crime. In
addition, it provides support to law
enforcement agencies overseas.
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories.
Northern Ireland has its own laboratory.
Powers and Procedures
England and Wales
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of
practice. Evidence obtained in breach of the
codes may be ruled inadmissible in court. The
codes must be readily accessible in all police
stations.
• Stop and search—Police officers can stop
and search people and vehicles if they
reasonably suspect that they will find
stolen goods, offensive weapons or
implements that could be used for
burglary and other offences. An officer
must record the grounds for the search,
and anything found, and the person
stopped is entitled to a copy. Senior
police officers can authorise broader stop
and search operations in specified
localities if they believe that serious
incidents of violence may take place, or to
prevent acts of terrorism.
• Arrest—The police may arrest a suspect
on a warrant issued by a court, but can
arrest without warrant for arrestable
offences (for which the sentence is fixed
by law or for which the term of
imprisonment is five years or more). This
category includes serious arrestable
offences such as murder and rape. There
is a general power of arrest for all other
offences if it is inappropriate to proceed
by way of a court summons, or if an
officer believes a suspect may injure
someone else or damage property.
• Detention and questioning—Suspects must
be cautioned before the police can ask
any questions about an offence. They
must be told that they do not have to say
anything, but that anything they do say
may be given in evidence in court, and
that it may be harmful to their defence if
they fail to mention something during
questioning which they later rely on in
court. For arrestable offences, a suspect
can be detained in police custody without
charge for up to 24 hours. Someone
suspected of a serious arrestable offence
can be held for up to 96 hours, but not
beyond 36 hours unless a warrant is
obtained from a magistrates’ court.
Interviews with suspects at police
stations are generally tape-recorded when
the police are investigating indictable
218
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
offences and in certain other cases.
Suspects are entitled to a copy of the
recording if charged or told that they will
be prosecuted.
If someone thinks that his or her
detention is unlawful, he or she may
apply to the High Court for a writ of
habeas corpus against the person
responsible, requiring them to appear
before the court to justify the detention.
Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
• Charging—Once there is sufficient
evidence, the police have to decide
whether a detained person should be
charged with an offence. If the police
institute criminal proceedings against a
suspect, the CPS (see p. 221) then takes
control of the case.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant, under wide common law
powers, if they are seen or reported as
committing a crime or are a danger to
themselves or others. They also have specific
statutory powers of arrest for some offences.
In other cases they may apply to a justice of
the peace for a warrant. As in England and
Wales, Scottish police have powers to enter a
building without a warrant if they are
pursuing someone who has committed, or
attempted to commit, a serious crime. A court
can grant the police a warrant to search
premises for stated items in connection with a
crime, again as in England and Wales. The
police may search anyone suspected of
carrying an offensive weapon. Someone
suspected of an imprisonable offence may be
held for police questioning without being
arrested, but for no more than six hours
without being charged. If arrested, suspects
must be charged and cautioned. The case is
then referred to the procurator fiscal (see
p. 228). Tape recording of interviews with
suspects is common practice.
The law in Northern Ireland relating to
police powers in the investigation of crime and
to evidence in criminal proceedings is similar
to that in force in England and Wales.
Firearms
The policy in Great Britain is that the police
should not generally be armed but that there
should be specialist firearms officers, deployed
on the authority of a senior officer where an
operational need arises. Most forces operate
armed response vehicles that can be deployed
quickly to contain firearms incidents. In
Northern Ireland police officers are issued
with firearms for their personal protection.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if
suspected of a criminal offence. Officers are
also subject to a code of conduct. If found
guilty of breaching the code, an officer can be
dismissed.
New conduct and efficiency arrangements
came into effect in April 1999. The main
changes include introducing the civil standard
of proof at disciplinary hearings; a fast-track
procedure to deal swiftly with officers caught
committing serious criminal offences; and
separate formal procedures (for the first time)
for dealing with unsatisfactory performance.
Complaints
Members of the public can make complaints
against the police if they feel that they have
been treated unfairly or improperly. In
England and Wales the investigation of such
complaints by the force concerned is overseen,
or in more serious cases supervised, by the
Police Complaints Authority. In Scotland
complaints against police officers involving
allegations of criminal conduct are referred to
the procurator fiscal for investigation. The
Scottish Inspectorate of Constabulary
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints. In Northern Ireland
the Independent Commission for Police
Complaints is being superseded by a Police
Ombudsman.
Community Relations
Within every police authority there are
police/community liaison consultative
219
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
arrangements, involving representatives from
the police, local government and community
groups. Home Office and police service
initiatives have sought to ensure that racist
crime3 is treated as a police priority (despite
the shortcomings that came to light in the
Stephen Lawrence case—see below). HM
Inspectorate of Constabulary collects statistics
on the number of racist incidents recorded by
forces.
The need to recruit more members of the
ethnic minorities to the police service, and
retain them, has been recognised. In England
and Wales there are about 2,200 officers from
ethnic minorities. The corresponding figure
for Scotland is about 50. In April 1999 the
Government set new targets for the number of
ethnic minority officers in all areas of the
country (with the basic aim of achieving a
similar proportion of ethnic minority officers
to that of the population in a particular police
force area).
The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry
In April 1993 a young black student, Stephen
Lawrence, was murdered in a racist attack in
south-east London. Concerns about
inadequacies in the investigation of the case by
the Metropolitan Police Service led ultimately
to an official inquiry, which reported in
February 1999. The report was critical, with
some exceptions, of police conduct, claiming
there was a combination of professional
incompetence, institutional racism and a
failure of leadership by senior officers. Among
its 70 recommendations to improve trust and
confidence in policing, the report proposed:
• a review of racism awareness training
throughout the police service;
• an inspection of the Metropolitan Police
Service by the Inspectorate of
Constabulary;
• greater accountability of the
Metropolitan Police Service to the
communities that it serves (a concern
which should be addressed by the

under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
pending creation of a new police
authority for London—see p. 217);
• the establishment of a fully independent
police complaints system;
• the promotion of cultural diversity and
prevention of racism in schools;
• the extension of the Race Relations Act
1976 (see p. 115) to the police service (a
proposal that the Government intends to
apply to all public services); and
• revisions to police disciplinary
procedures (see p. 219).
The report was welcomed by the
Government, which announced an action plan
in March to take forward the
recommendations (most of which should be
implemented by the end of 1999; the
remainder should be in place within three
years). The Home Secretary has taken
personal responsibility for the delivery of the
programme set out in the inquiry report.
Legal System of England
and Wales
Responsibility for the administration and
management of the English legal system is
divided between various government
departments and agencies.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and sits as a member of the judicial
committee of the House of Lords. He also
presides over the House of Lords in its
legislative capacity, and is a senior cabinet
minister heading a government department,
the Lord Chancellor’s Department, which has
overall responsibility for the court system,
including the Supreme Court (comprising the
Court of Appeal, High Court and Crown
Court) and the county courts in England and
Wales. That responsibility is exercised
through the Court Service. He has overall
responsibility for magistrates’ courts. He
advises the Crown on the appointment of most
members of the higher judiciary, and appoints
most magistrates. He has responsibility for the
civil justice process, for promoting general
reforms of the civil law and for the legal aid
schemes.
220
.
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
The Hume Secretary has overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police
service, the prison system and the probation
service, and for advising the Crown on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers, providing advice on a range of legal
matters, including proposed legislation. They
may represent the Crown in appropriate
domestic and international cases of difficulty or
public importance, although they do not always
do so. As well as exercising various civil law
functions, the Attorney General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor General is the Attorney’s deputy.
The Crown Prosecution Service is headed
by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP),
who is independent, but superintended by the
Attorney General. Other prosecuting
authorities include the Serious Fraud Office,
which answers to the Attorney General, and
bodies such as the Inland Revenue, Customs
and Excise Commissioners, local authorities
and trading standards departments which
prosecute cases within their own sphere of
activity. Private prosecutions by individuals are
permitted in respect of most crimes, but some
require the consent of the Attorney General
and they may be taken over by the DPP. They
are few in number.
Some administrative functions are performed
by senior members of the judiciary: the Lord
Chief Justice,4 for example, has some
responsibilities for the organisation and work of
the criminal courts. Other functions are
performed by statutory committees. The Civil
Procedure Rules Committee, created by the Civil
Procedure Act 1997, is responsible for the making
of rules that govern the civil justice process, and
comprises members of the judiciary, members of
the legal profession and lay representatives.
Responsibility for the management of
functions often lies with executive bodies or
agencies. Examples include the Prison
Service, Forensic Science Service, the Legal
Aid Board, and the Youth Justice Board,
which started work in 1998.
The Government is advised by a range of
bodies of a statutory and non-statutory nature.
These include the police inspectorates, the
magistrates’ courts service, the probation
service, the Audit Commission, the Criminal
Justice Consultative Committee, law reform
bodies such as the Law Commission and ad
hoc Royal Commissions and departmental
committees.
PROSECUTION AND THE
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution Arrangements
Crown Prosecution Service
The CPS is the government department
responsible for prosecuting people in England
and Wales who have been charged with a
criminal offence. It works closely with the police,
but is an independent body. Every year the CPS
deals with more than 1.3 million cases in
magistrates’ courts and about 120,000 in the
Crown Court. With headquarters in London
and York, the Service operates under a structure
(introduced in April 1999) of 42 geographical
Areas in England and Wales. The Areas
correspond to the 43 police forces in England
and Wales, with the CPS London Area covering
the operational boundaries of both City of
London and Metropolitan Police Forces. Each
Area is headed by a Chief Crown Prosecutor,
who is responsible for prosecutions within the
Area, supported by an Area Business Manager.
The CPS:
• advises the police on possible
prosecutions;
• reviews prosecutions started by the police
to ensure that the right defendants are
prosecuted on the right charges before
the appropriate court;
• prepares cases for court; and
• prosecutes cases at magistrates’ courts
and instructs counsel to prosecute cases
in the Crown Court and higher courts.5
5 Under a change in legal rules, a number of CPS lawyers
are now qualified to appear in some cases in the Crown
Court and other higher courts.
4 The Lord Chief Justice is head of the Queen’s Bench
Division of the High Court, and ranks second only to the
Lord Chancellor in the judicial hierarchy.
221
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Structure of the Courts in England and Wales
The decision by the CPS on whether or not
to go ahead with a case is based on two criteria.
Crown Prosecutors must be satisfied that there
is enough evidence to provide a realistic
prospect of conviction against each defendant
on each charge. There may also be instances
where an analysis of the public interest will lead
to a decision not to prosecute, although these
must clearly outweigh any other factors which
point in the opposite direction.
Serious Fraud Office
Cases of serious or complex fraud are
prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office.
Investigations are conducted by teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists. The Office has wide powers that
go beyond those normally available to the
police and prosecuting authorities.
Initial Stages
For minor offences, the police may decide to
caution the offender rather than prosecute. A
caution does not amount to a conviction, and
will not take place unless the person admits
the offence. Under the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998, cautioning for young offenders is
being replaced with the final warning scheme
(see p. 225).
If the police decide to charge a person, that
person may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. If not granted police bail,
the defendant must be brought before a
magistrates’ court (or, if under 18, a youth
court) as soon as possible. There is a general
right to bail, but magistrates may withhold bail
if there are substantial grounds for believing
that an accused person would abscond, commit
an offence, or otherwise obstruct justice.
If bail is refused, an accused has the right to
apply again, subject to certain limitations, to
the Crown Court or to a High Court judge in
chambers. He or she must be told of this right.
In certain circumstances, the prosecution may
appeal to a Crown Court judge against the
granting of bail by magistrates.
Once a person has been charged, it is for
the CPS to decide whether the case should
proceed.
222
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Criminal Courts
Criminal offences are divided into: summary
offences, which are the least serious and are
triable only in a magistrates’ court; and
indictable ones, which are subdivided into
‘indictable-only’ offences (such as murder,
manslaughter or robbery) which must be tried
on indictment6 at the Crown Court by judge
and jury, and either-way offences, which may
be tried either summarily or on indictment.
Either-way offences, such as theft and
burglary, can vary greatly in seriousness. A
magistrates’ court decides whether an either-
way case is serious enough to warrant trial in
the Crown Court, but if the magistrates decide
in favour of summary trial, the accused person
can elect to have trial by jury in the Crown
Court (although this right would be abolished
under government proposals announced in
May 1999).
Magistrates’ courts deal with about 97% of
criminal offence prosecutions in England and
Wales.
Where a case is to be tried on indictment,
the magistrates’ court must be satisfied that
there is a case to answer. In most cases this is
accepted by the defence and the magistrates
do not need to consider the evidence. If the
defence challenges the case, the magistrates
consider the documentary evidence: no
witnesses are called to give evidence. If there
is a case to be answered, the accused is
committed for trial.
A magistrates’ court usually comprises
three lay magistrates (see also p. 212), known
as justices of the peace (JPs), who sit with a
court clerk to advise them on law and
procedure. The court clerk will be qualified to
act as such, although not always a qualified
lawyer.7 In some areas a stipendiary (paid
professional) magistrate sits instead of the JPs.
Stipendiary magistrates are becoming
increasingly common, although most cases are
still dealt with by lay magistrates.
6 An indictment is a written accusation against a person,
charging him or her with serious crime triable by jury.
7 New rules came into force in January 1999 to provide for
all new court clerks to be professionally qualified as a
barrister or solicitor.
Responsibility for running the magistrates’
courts service locally rests with magistrates’
courts committees (MCCs), made up of lay
magistrates selected by their colleagues. The
number of MCCs is being reduced, and their
areas increased, to improve efficiency and to
bring their boundaries to closer alignment
with those of other criminal justice agencies,
such as the police and the CPS.
Youth courts are specialist magistrates’
courts, which sit separately from those
dealing with adults. They deal with all but the
most serious charges against people aged at
least ten (the age of criminal responsibility)
and under 18. JPs who have been specially
trained sit in youth courts. Proceedings are
held in private.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues,
in six regional areas called circuits, and is
presided over by High Court judges, circuit
judges and part-time recorders. The type of
judge who will preside over a case, with a jury
of 12 members of the public, will depend on
which Crown Court the case is being heard in:
not all Crown Courts deal with cases of the
same level of seriousness.
Trial
Criminal trials have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved beyond reasonable
doubt by the prosecution.
Pre-trial Procedure
Accused people have a right at all stages to
remain silent; however, an adverse inference
may be drawn from their failure to mention
facts when questioned which they later rely
upon in their defence. The prosecution
discloses to the defence the material which it
proposes to rely on at the trial. In addition, the
law requires the prosecution to disclose to the
defence material in its possession that it does
not intend to use in the trial:
Primary disclosure—The prosecution must
disclose material which might undermine the
prosecution case.
Defence disclosure—In Crown Court cases
the defence must give a statement outlining in
223
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
general terms the nature of the defence,
including details of any alibis. This statement
is voluntary in cases tried in magistrates’
courts.
Secondary disclosure—The prosecution
must disclose any unused material not
previously disclosed which might reasonably
be expected to assist the defence as disclosed
in the defence statement.
The prosecution may apply for sensitive
material not to be disclosed; the defence may
apply for disclosure where it considers that
material which should have been disclosed has
not been provided by the prosecution.
In a case to be tried on indictment, a judge
may hold a preliminary hearing, where pleas
of guilty or not guilty are taken. If the
defendant pleads guilty the judge will proceed
to sentence. In contested cases, the
prosecution and defence are expected to assist
the judge in identifying key issues, and to
provide any additional information required
for the proper and efficient trial of the case.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court. The burden of proof is on the
prosecution, and strict rules of evidence
govern how matters may be proved. Certain
types of evidence may be excluded because of
their prejudicial effect, or because of their
unreliability. Documentary statements by
witnesses are allowed with the consent of the
other party or in limited circumstances at the
discretion of the court. Otherwise evidence is
taken from witnesses testifying orally on
oath. Child witnesses may testify without
taking the oath and their evidence must be
received by the court unless the child is
incapable of giving intelligible testimony. A
child in some circumstances can testify
through a live TV link, and the court may
consider a video-recorded interview as the
evidence of the child, subject to the defence
having the right to question the child in
cross-examination. Further measures to help
both child witnesses and adult vulnerable or
intimidated witnesses to give their best
evidence in court are being introduced under
the Youth and Criminal Evidence Act 1999
(see p. 224).
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the case to the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
The jury verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’, the latter resulting in acquittal. Juries
may, subject to certain conditions, reach a
verdict by a majority of at least 10 to 2.
If an accused is acquitted, there is no right
of prosecution appeal, and the accused cannot
be tried again for that same offence. However,
an acquittal may be set aside and a retrial
ordered if the acquittal has been tainted by a
conviction for interfering with or intimidating
a juror.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and
any attempt to interfere with its members is a
criminal offence. People aged between 18 and
70 whose names appear on the electoral
register are, with certain exceptions, liable for
jury service; their names are chosen at
random.
Sentencing
The court will sentence the offender after
considering all the relevant information,
which may include a pre-sentence report and
any other necessary specialist report, and a
plea in mitigation by a defence advocate. The
powers of the magistrates’ court in respect of
sentence are limited to a maximum period of
12 months’ imprisonment. The offender may
be sent to the Crown Court for sentence if the
magistrates feel their powers of sentence are
insufficient.
A custodial sentence can be imposed only
where the offence is so serious that a custodial
sentence alone is justified. A term of up to two
years’ imprisonment may be suspended. A
second serious violent or sexual offence
requires a court to impose a life sentence
unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Life imprisonment is the mandatory sentence
for murder, and is available for certain other
serious offences.
For offences not so serious as to require a
custodial sentence, community sentences may
be imposed. These can include probation
orders (involving supervision in the
224

announced the introduction of three-year
minimum sentences for those convicted of

community—see p. 235), community service
(work within the community), combination
orders (a mixture of probation and community
service), and curfew orders (requiring the
offender to remain at a specified place for
specified periods, monitored by electronic
tagging). A fine is the most common
punishment, with most offenders fined for
summary offences. A court may also impose
compensation orders, which require the
offender to pay compensation for personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from an
offence; or impose a conditional discharge,
whereby the offender may be resentenced for
the original offence if the discharge is broken
by reoffending.
Young Offenders
Offenders aged 10 to 17 years come within the
jurisdiction of youth courts, but may also be
tried in an adult magistrates’ court or in a
Crown Court, depending on the nature of the
offence. Existing non-custodial penalties
include: conditional discharge; fines and
compensation orders (where the parents of
offenders may be ordered to pay); supervision
orders (where the offender would have to
comply with certain requirements, which
might possibly include a stay in local authority
accommodation); and attendance centre
orders; 16- and 17-year-olds may also be given
the same probation, community service,
combination and curfew orders as older
offenders.
Custodial sentences are available to the
courts where no alternative is considered
appropriate. The main custodial sentence for
those aged 15 and over is currently detention
in a young offender institution. Remission of
part of the sentence for good behaviour,
release on parole and supervision on release
are available. A secure training order may be
given to those persistent offenders aged 12 to
14 who fulfil certain strict criteria.
A number of measures have been taken under
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to prevent
offending and reoffending by young people.
Local authorities are required to produce annual
youth justice plans detailing how youth justice
services in their areas will be provided and
funded. They are also having to establish one or
more youth offending teams whose membership
will be drawn from the police, social services, the
probation service, health and education
authorities and, if considered appropriate locally,
the voluntary sector. As well as supervising
existing community sentences, these teams will
provide and supervise a range of new orders and
powers under the Act (see below).
The Act introduces a statutory final
warning scheme to replace the practice of
repeat cautioning by the police. The scheme is
intended to provide a swift response to early
incidences of criminal behaviour, and a final
warning will also trigger referral to a youth
offending team to draw up a rehabilitation
programme to address the factors which led
the young person into offending.
New orders include: a reparation order,
which will require young offenders to make
non-financial reparation to the victim(s) of
their offence or to the community which they
have harmed; and an action plan order, which
will require them to comply with an
individually tailored action plan intended to
address their offending behaviour. These new
orders, together with the final warning
scheme, are being piloted in certain specified
areas for 18 months from the end of
September 1998. There will also be a detention
and training order, which will combine custody
and community supervision; this is to be
implemented in April 2000.
The new criminal orders will be
complemented by a range of other powers.
These include parenting orders, which will
require a parent or guardian to attend
counselling and guidance sessions, and may
direct them to comply with specified
requirements; and child safety orders, which
place a child under ten who is at risk of
becoming involved in crime or is behaving in
an anti-social manner under the supervision of
a specified, responsible officer.
The Youth Justice Board for England and
Wales, established under the Crime and
225
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Disorder Act 1998, began operation in
September 1998 to monitor the youth justice
system, promote good practice and advise the
Home Secretary on the operation of the
system and the setting of national standards.
A new sentence of referral to a youth
offender panel is being introduced under
the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence
Act 1999. It will be available for young
people pleading guilty who are convicted
for a first time, and its primary aim is to
prevent reoffending. The panel will work
to establish a programme of behaviour for
the young offender. This will include
making restoration to the victim, taking
responsibility for the consequences of his
or her actions, and achieving reintegration
into the law-abiding community.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the High Court, on points of
law, and to the Crown Court, by way of re¬
hearing. Appeals from the Crown Court go to
the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A
further appeal can be made to the House of
Lords on points of law of public importance.
A prosecutor cannot appeal against an
acquittal, but mechanisms exist to review
over-lenient sentences and rulings of law.
Alleged miscarriages of justice in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are reviewed by
the Criminal Cases Review Commission,
which is independent of both government and
the courts. Referral of a case requires some
new argument or evidence not previously
raised at the trial or on appeal.
Coroners’ Courts
The coroner (usually a senior lawyer or
doctor) must hold an inquest if the deceased
died violently, unnaturally, suddenly, if the
cause is unknown, in prison or in certain
specified circumstances. The coroner’s court
establishes how, when and where the deceased
died. A coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Jurisdiction in civil matters is split between the
High Court and the county courts. Some 90%
of all cases are dealt with by the county courts,
but most civil disputes do not go to court at all.
Many are dealt with through statutory or
voluntary complaints mechanisms, or through
mediation and negotiation. Arbitration is a
common form of adjudication in commercial
and building disputes. Ombudsmen have the
power to determine complaints in the public
sector, and, on a voluntary basis, in some
private sector activities (for example, banking,
insurance and pensions).
A large number of tribunals exist to
determine disputes. About 80 different types
of tribunal are supervised by a statutory
supervisory body, the Council on Tribunals,
and deal with disputes such as liability for tax
(Commissioners for Income Tax), eligibility
for social benefit (Social Security Appeals
Tribunals) and the compulsory treatment of
an individual for mental health problems
(Mental Health Review Tribunals).
Courts
The High Court is divided into three
Divisions (see chart on p. 222).
• The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters (in a specialist
Commercial Court), and liability in tort
(general civil wrongs, such as accidents
caused by negligence, or defamation of
character). A Queen’s Bench Divisional
Court has special responsibility for dealing
with applications for judicial review of the
actions of public bodies, and has the
power to declare the action of a public
individual, department or body unlawful.
• The Chancery Division deals with
disputes relating to land, wills,
companies and insolvency.
• The Family Division deals with matters
relating to divorce and the welfare of
children.
The county courts deal with claims in
contract and in tort, with family matters
226
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
(including divorce and the welfare of children)
and a wide range of statutory matters.
Magistrates’ courts have limited civil
jurisdiction, in family matters (when they sit
as a Family Proceedings Court) and in
miscellaneous civil orders.
Appeals in civil cases in the county courts
or High Court generally go to the Court of
Appeal (Civil Division). Appeals from
magistrates’ courts in civil matters go to the
High Court, on matters of law, or to the
Crown Court, if the case is to be re-heard. A
further appeal on points of law of public
importance goes to the House of Lords. The
Access to Justice Act 1999 will reform the
jurisdiction of the courts to hear appeals in
civil and family cases, and the constitution of
the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal (see
below).
Reform of the Civil Justice System
The Government has stated its intention to
modernise and simplify court procedures
wherever possible, and reduce delay.
Following a thorough review of the civil
justice system, the first phase of reform was
implemented in April 1999. The key elements
are the introduction of:
• a unified code of procedural rules,
written in plain English, and replacing
separate sets of High Court and county
court rules. The main objective of the
new rules is to enable the courts to deal
with cases more appropriately. This
includes the court taking a more active
case management role than before, to
ensure that cases are dealt with in a way
which is proportionate to their value,
complexity and importance;
• pre-action protocols (for clinical
negligence and personal injury cases)
setting standards and timetables for the
conduct of cases before court proceedings
are started. This will require more
exchange of information and fuller
investigation of claims at an earlier stage.
People should therefore be in a better
position to make a realistic assessment of
the merits of a case far earlier than
before, encouraging them to settle
disputes without recourse to litigation.
Where litigation is unavoidable, cases
coming to court should be better
prepared than before. Judges are
expected to apply the protocols strictly,
and impose sanctions on those breaching
them; and
• a system of three tracks to which
disputed claims will be assigned by a
judge according to the value and
complexity of the case. These are:
—the small claims track, w hich will deal
with cases worth less than £5,000 at an
informal hearing by a district judge;
—the fast track, which will deal with
cases worth from £5,000 to £15,000 and
set a fixed timetable from allocation to
trial; and
—the multi-track, for cases worth over
£15,000 or of unusual complexity, which
will be supervised by a judge and given
timetables tailored to each case.
The great majority of civil cases, other than
small claims, will be run under the fast track
procedure. Judges have a key role in ensuring
that the new procedures deliver the objectives
of reducing cost, delay and complexity, by
managing cases to ensure that litigants and
their representatives keep to the timetable,
and undertake only necessary work. As part of
the reform programme, the Court Service is
introducing further information technology to
support the work of judges and staff in civil
courts.
The Access to Justice Act 1999 will reform
the workings of the appeals system according
to the principles of proportionality and
efficiency that underpin the civil justice
reforms generally. The objectives of
proportionality and efficiency will be achieved
by:
• diverting from the Court of Appeal those
cases which, by their nature, do not
require the attention of the most senior
judges; and
• making various changes to the working
methods and constitution of the Court,
which will enable it to deploy its
resources more effectively.
227
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Civil Justice Council has been
established to oversee the working of the civil
justice system, and to make proposals for its
improvement.
Legal System of Scotland
Scots law belongs to a small group of ‘mixed’
legal systems which have legal principles, rules
and concepts modelled on both Roman and
English law. The main sources of Scots law
are judge-made law, certain legal treatises
having ‘institutional’ authority, legislation,
and EC law. The first two sources are
sometimes referred to as the common law of
Scotland. Legislation, as in the rest ot the UK,
consists of statutes (Acts of Parliament) or
subordinate legislation authorised by
Parliament.

may be released by the police to await
summons, on an undertaking to appear at
court at a specified time, or be held in custody
to appear at court on the next working day.
Following that appearance, the accused person
may be remanded in custody until trial or
released by the court on bail. If released on
bail, the accused person must undertake to
appear at trial when required, not to commit
an offence while on bail, and not to interfere
with witnesses or obstruct justice. The court
may impose additional conditions on the
accused (for example, to keep away from
certain people or locations). There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by an accused
person against the refusal of bail, or by the
prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either against the conditions imposed.
Bail will not be granted where an accused
person is charged with murder, culpable
homicide, rape or attempted rape, and has any
previous conviction for such a crime (in the
case of culpable homicide, involving a prison
sentence).
Prosecution Arrangements
The Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions in the High Court, sheriff courts
and district courts. In contrast to England, the
police in Scotland cannot initiate criminal
proceedings, and private prosecutions are
extremely rare. The Lord Advocate discharges
his responsibility for criminal prosecution
through the Crown Office, which is staffed by
legally qualified civil servants and run by the
Crown Agent, who is head of the Procurator
Fiscal Service. Procurators fiscal are the Lord
Advocate’s local representatives, with one for
each sheriff court. They are lawyers and full¬
time civil servants subject to the direction of
the Crown Office. They must be either
advocates or solicitors, but are usually
solicitors.
Prosecutions in the High Court are
prepared by procurators fiscal and Crown
Office officials, and are conducted by the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland; they in turn delegate the bulk of
their work to advocates depute, collectively
known as Crown Counsel, of whom there are
13. In all other criminal courts the decision to
prosecute is made, and prosecution carried
out, by procurators fiscal.
The police report gives details of alleged
crimes to the local procurator fiscal who has
discretion whether or not to prosecute. He or
she may receive instructions from the Crown
Council on behalf of the Lord Advocate.
The office of coroner does not exist in
Scotland. Instead the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into sudden or suspicious
deaths and may report the findings to the
Crown Office. When appropriate, a fatal
accident inquiry may be held before the sheriff;
this is mandatory in cases of death resulting
from industrial accidents and deaths in custody.
Criminal Courts
There are three criminal courts in Scotland:
the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. Cases are heard under
one of two types of criminal procedure:
• In solemn procedure in both the High
Court of Justiciary and the sheriff court,
an accused person’s trial takes place
228
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15 lay
people. As in England and Wales, the
alleged offence is set out in a document
called an indictment. The judge decides
questions of law and the jury decide
questions of fact and may reach a
decision by a simple majority. They may
decide to find the accused ‘guilty’, ‘not
guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the last two are
acquittals and have the effect that the
accused cannot be tried again for the
same offence.
• In summary procedure in sheriff and
district courts, the judge sits without a
jury and decides questions of both fact
and law. The offence charged is set out in
a document called a summary complaint.
In Scotland the court in summary cases is
required to fix an additional hearing
(intermediate diet) at some time between the
court appearance and the trial to establish the
state of readiness of both the defence and the
prosecution. Solemn procedure in the sheriff
court also requires a hearing to find out
whether the case is ready to go for trial. The
prosecution in solemn cases must give the
defence advance notice of the witnesses it
intends to call and of the documents and other
items on which it will rely.
The High Court of Justiciary is the Supreme
Criminal Court in Scotland, based in
Edinburgh and sitting in Glasgow and other
major towns and cities. It tries the most
serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction in
cases involving murder, treason and rape.
The 49 sheriff courts deal mainly with less
serious offences committed within the sheriff
court district over which they have
jurisdiction. These courts are organised in six
sheriffdoms, and at the head of the judiciary of
each sheriffdom is the sheriff principal. There
are over 100 permanent sheriffs, most of
whom are appointed to particular courts.
Fifteen are ‘floating’ sheriffs who may take
cases in any court. In addition, there is a panel
of temporary sheriffs who may undertake
duties in any sheriffdom.
The sheriff has jurisdiction in both
summary and solemn criminal cases. In the
summary court, the sheriff may impose prison
sentences of up to three months, or in some
cases 12 months, or a fine not exceeding the
‘prescribed sum’, that is, up to £5,000 for a
common law offence. Under solemn
procedure, the sheriff may impose
imprisonment for up to three years and
unlimited financial penalties, and has an
additional power of remit to the High Court of
Justiciary if he or she thinks a heavier sentence
should be imposed. The sheriff also has
available a range of non-custodial sentences,
principally community service and probation.
District courts, which deal with minor
offences, are the administrative responsibility
of the local authority. The longest prison
sentence which can be imposed is generally 60
days and the maximum fine is £2,500. The
bench of a district court will usually be made
up of one or more lay justices of the peace. A
local authority may also appoint a stipendiary
magistrate, who must be a professional lawyer
of at least five years’ standing, and who has the
same summary criminal jurisdiction and
powers as a sheriff. At present, only Glasgow
has stipendiary magistrates sitting in the
district court.
Sentencing
In Scotland a court must obtain a social
enquiry report before imposing a custodial
sentence if the accused is aged under 21 or has
not previously served a custodial sentence. A
report is also required before making a
probation or community service order, or in
cases involving people already subject to
supervision.
Non-custodial sentences
Non-custodial sentences available to the
courts include fines, and community service
orders, for which the minimum number of
hours is 80 and the maximum, under solemn
procedure, 300. Restriction of liberty orders,
restricting an offender’s movements for up to
12 months, are being piloted in three areas.
Compliance is monitored by electronic tags.
Offenders must be aged 16 or over.
Supervised attendance orders provide an
alternative to imprisonment for fine default,
and incorporate aspects of work and training.
229
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary also sits (in a
court of at least two judges) as the Scottish
Court of Criminal Appeal. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or
both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it
sets aside a conviction. There is no appeal
from this court in criminal cases.
In April 1999 the Scottish Criminal Cases
Review Commission—a new,
independent, non-departmental public
body—assumed responsibility from the
Secretary of State for considering alleged
miscarriages of justice in Scotland and
referring cases meeting the relevant
criteria to the Court of Appeal for review.
CIVIL COURTS
The main civil courts are the Court of Session
(the supreme court, subject to appeal only to
the House of Lords in London) and the sheriff
court (the principal local court).
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and
may hear cases at first instance as well as
those transferred to it and appealed from
sheriff courts and from tribunals. A leading
principle of the court is that cases originating
in it are both prepared for decision, and
decided, by judges sitting singly whose
decisions are subject to review by several
judges. The total number of judges is 27, of
whom 19, called Lords Ordinary, mainly
decide cases in the first instance. This branch
of the court is called the Outer House. 1 he
other eight judges are divided into two
divisions of four judges each, forming the
Inner House. The First Division is presided
over by the Lord President of the Court of
Session and the Second Division by the Lord
Justice-Clerk. The main business of each
division is to review the decisions of the
Lords Ordinary or inferior courts which have
been appealed to it.
In addition to its criminal jurisdiction, the
sheriff court deals with most civil litigation in
Scotland. Its jurisdiction is very wide. The
value of the subject matter with which the court
can deal has, with very few exceptions, no
upper limit, and a broad range of remedies can
be granted. Cases dealt with include, among
other things, debts, contract, reparation, rent
restrictions, actions affecting the use of
property, or affecting leases and tenancies, and
actions in relation to children. It also deals with
actions between husband and wife, and can
vary Court of Session decrees dealing with
parental rights and responsibilities or awards of
custody or financial provision. The sheriff
court has concurrent jurisdiction with the
Court of Session in actions for divorce. There
is a right of appeal in some cases from the
sheriff to the Sheriff Principal and thence, in
some cases, to the Court of Session.
Civil Proceedings
The formal proceedings in the Court of
Session are initiated by serving the defender
with a summons or, in sheriff court cases in
ordinary actions, an initial writ. A defender
who intends to contest the action must inform
the court; if he or she fails to do so, the court
normally grants a decree in absence in favour
of the pursuer. Where a case is contested, both
parties must prepare written pleadings. Time
is allowed for either party to adjust their
pleadings in the light of what the other has
said. At the end of this period a hearing will
normally be arranged.
In summary actions involving sums
between £750 and £1,500 in the sheriff court,
a statement of claim is incorporated in a
summons. The procedure is designed to
enable most actions to be settled without the
parties having to appear in court. Normally,
they, or their representatives, need appear
only when an action is defended.
In cases below £750 a special small claim
procedure enables those who do not have
legal advice to raise claims themselves. The
procedures are similar to, but less formal
than, the summary procedure. In addition to
the courts, there is a wide range of tribunals
which administer justice in special types of
case. Many of these are common to the rest
of Great Britain; others, such as the Land
Court, the Lands Tribunal and the
230
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Children’s Hearings, are peculiar to
Scotland.
Children
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged eight years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of age
is prosecuted.
Most children under 16 who have
committed an offence or are considered to be
in need of care and protection may be brought
before a Children’s Hearing. The hearing,
consisting of three lay people, determines in
an informal setting, often with the child and
his or her parents, whether compulsory
measures of care are required and, if so, the
form they should take. An official known as
the reporter to the Children’s Hearing decides
whether the child should come before a
hearing. If the grounds for referral for a
hearing are not accepted by the child or
parent, the case goes to the sheriff for proof to
establish the grounds. If the sheriff finds the
grounds established, he or she sends the case
back to the reporter to arrange a Children’s
Hearing. The sheriff also hears appeals against
a hearing’s decision.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in young offender
institutions. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE
SCOTTISH LEGAL SYSTEM
The Scottish Executive Justice Department,
under the Minister for Justice, is a new
Department bringing together the Scottish
Office Home Department and the Scottish
Courts Administration. Since devolution, it is
responsible for civil law and criminal justice,
including criminal justice social work services,
police, prisons, courts administration, legal
aid, and liaison with the legal profession in
Scotland. There are two agencies in the
Department—the Scottish Prison Service (see
p. 233) and the Scottish Court Service, which
deals with the work of the Supreme Courts
and the sheriff courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland serve as the Law Officers
of the Scottish Executive, providing it with
advice on legal matters and representing its
interests in the courts. Both officers have
ceased to be members of the UK Government.
Advice to the UK Government on Scots law is
now provided by the Advocate General for
Scotland.
The role of the new Scottish Parliament is
to make laws in relation to devolved matters
in Scotland. In these areas, it is able to amend
or repeal existing Acts of the UK Parliament
and to pass new legislation of its own in
relation to devolved matters. It is also able to
consider and pass private legislation,
promoted by individuals or bodies (for
example, local authorities) in relation to
devolved matters.
The Court of Session and the High Court
of Justiciary enact the rules regulating their
own procedure and the procedures of the
sheriff courts and the lay summary courts.
The Court of Session and Criminal Courts
Rules Councils, and the Sheriffs Courts Rules
Council, consisting of judges and legal
practitioners, advise the courts about
amending the rules.
Legal System of
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is similar to
that in England and Wales. Jury trials have the
same place in the system, except in the case of
offences involving acts of terrorism (see
below). In addition, the course of litigation is
the same and the legal profession has the same
two branches.
Superior Courts
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises
the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the
Crown Court. All matters relating to these
courts are under the jurisdiction of the UK
Parliament. Judges are appointed by the
Crown.
231
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Court of Appeal comprises the Lord
Chief justice (as President) and two Lords
Justices of Appeal. The High Court comprises
the Lord Chief Justice and five other judges.
The practice and procedure of the Court of
Appeal and the High Court are virtually the
same as in the corresponding courts in
England and Wales. Both courts sit in the
Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review
the civil law decisions of the High Court and
the criminal law decisions of the Crown
Court, and may in certain cases review the
decisions of county courts and magistrates’
courts. Subject to certain restrictions, an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal can go to the House of Lords.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s
Bench Division, dealing with most civil law
matters; a Chancery Division, dealing with,
for instance, trusts and estates, title to land,
mortgages and charges, wills and company
matters; and a Family Division, dealing
principally with matrimonial cases, adoption,
wardship, patients’ affairs and undisputed
probate matters.
The Crorvn Court deals with all serious
criminal cases.
Inferior Courts
The inferior courts are the county courts and
the magistrates’ courts, both of which differ in
a number of ways from their counterparts in
England and Wales.
County courts are primarily civil law courts.
They are presided over by one of 14 county
court judges, two of whom—in Belfast and
Londonderry—have the title of recorder.
Appeals go from the county courts to the High
Court. The county courts also deal with
appeals from the magistrates’ courts in both
criminal and civil matters. In civil matters, the
county courts handle most actions in which
the amount or the value of specific articles
claimed is below a certain value. The courts
also deal with actions involving title to, or the
recovery of, land; equity matters such as trusts
and estates; mortgages; and the sale of land
and partnerships.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily
with minor local criminal cases is carried out
in magistrates ’ courts presided over by a full¬
time, legally qualified resident magistrate. The
magistrates’ courts also exercise jurisdiction in
certain family law cases and have a very
limited jurisdiction in other civil cases.
Terrorist Offences
People accused of offences specified under
emergency legislation (see p. 216) are tried in
the Crown Court without jury. The onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant
has the right to be represented by a lawyer of
his or her choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for convicting
and there is an automatic right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal against conviction and/or
sentence on points of fact as well as of law.
Administration of the Law
Court administration is the responsibility of
the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern
Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with policy and legislation concerning
criminal law, the police and the penal system.
The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for legal aid, advice and
assistance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, who is responsible to the
Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried
on indictment, and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Following the Good Friday Agreement of
1998 (see p. 16), the Government launched a
review of criminal justice in Northern Ireland.
(This excludes policing and emergency
legislation, which are being considered
separately.) The review is addressing the
structure, management and resourcing of
publicly funded elements of the criminal
justice system, covering issues such as:
• appointments to the judiciary and
magistracy;
• the organisation and supervision of the
prosecution process;
• the responsiveness and accountability of
the system;
232
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
• law reform;
• scope for co-operation between agencies
in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic; and
• the structure and organisation of criminal
justice functions that might be devolved
to a Northern Ireland Assembly.
Prison Service
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies. There are currently 136 prison
establishments in England and Wales (seven of
which are run by private contractors), 22 in
Scotland and four in Northern Ireland.
Prison accommodation ranges from open
prisons to high security establishments.
Sentenced prisoners are classified into different
risk-level groups for security purposes. Women
prisoners are held in separate prisons or in
separate accommodation in mixed prisons.
There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland.
In recent years the prison population as a
whole has been growing steadily in Great
Britain, but falling in Northern Ireland (see
Table 14.2).

Independent Oversight of the Prison
System
Every prison establishment in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland has a board of visitors,
comprising volunteers drawn from the local
community appointed by the Home Secretary
or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
Boards, which are independent, monitor
complaints by prisoners and concerns of staff,
and report as necessary to ministers. In
Scotland, visiting committees to prisons are
appointed by local authorities.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report
on the treatment of prisoners and prison
conditions, and submit annual reports to
Parliament. Each prison establishment is
visited about once every three years.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the Prisons Ombudsman, who is
independent of the Prison Service. In Scotland,
prisoners who exhaust the internal grievance
procedure may apply to the independent
Scottish Prisons Complaints Commission.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners in the UK may write and receive
letters, be visited by relatives and friends, and
make telephone calls. Privileges include a
personal radio; books, magazines and
newspapers; watching television; and the
opportunity to buy goods from the prison
shop with money earned in prison. Offences
against prison discipline are dealt with by
prison governors, who act as adjudicators. In
England, Wales and Scotland measures to
counter drug misuse in prisons include
mandatory drug testing. Voluntary testing has
been piloted in Northern Ireland but there is
no mandatory programme. People awaiting
trial in custody have certain rights and
privileges not granted to convicted prisoners.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will help with their
resettlement into the community on release
and to secure a return which will reduce the
cost of the prison system. The main industries
are clothing and textile manufacture,
engineering, woodwork, laundry and
horticulture. A small number of prisoners are
employed outside prison, some in community-
based service projects.
233
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Prison Education
Education is compulsory for young people in
custody below school-leaving age; otherwise it
is voluntary. There are many facilities
available for prisoners to gain vocational
qualifications, and some prisoners study for
public examinations, including those of the
Open University (see p. 141).
Physical education is compulsory for young
offenders, but otherwise voluntary.
Opportunities are given for inmates to obtain
sporting proficiency awards. Inmates also
compete against teams from the local
community.
Early Release of Prisoners
Prisoners in England and Wales sentenced to
less than four years are released once they
have served half of their term. Those
sentenced to four years or more may be
considered for early release after serving half
of their sentence; if found unsuitable at that
stage for parole, they are released
automatically at the two-thirds point. The
Parole Board has the final decision on the
early release of prisoners sentenced to four
years or more, but less than seven years. In
other cases it makes a recommendation to the
Home Secretary about a prisoner’s suitability
for parole. Prisoners sentenced to a year or
more are released on licence to be supervised
until the three-quarters point of the sentence;
they can be recalled to prison if they present
an unacceptable risk to the public during that
time. If convicted of another offence
punishable with imprisonment and
committed before the end of the original
sentence, a released prisoner may have to
serve all or part of the original sentence
outstanding at the time the fresh offence was
committed.
In Scotland similar arrangements apply
except that the Parole Board has the power to
release prisoners serving between four and ten
years from halfway through their sentence.
The release of prisoners serving more than ten
years needs the consent of the First Minister.
All prisoners sentenced to four years or more
are supervised from release until the end of
their sentence.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provides
for:
• the release of selected short-term
prisoners in England and Wales on a
home detention curfew licence (from the
end of January 1999), enforced by
electronic monitoring, up to two months
before the normal date of release;
• the imposition of a court sentence on a
sexual or violent offender which includes
an extended period of post-release
supervision (also applicable in Scotland);
and
• supervision of recalled and returned
short-term prisoners following their
second release from detention.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving
terms of more than five days are eligible for
remission of half their sentence. Following the
enactment of the Northern Ireland
(Sentences) Act 1998 (realising a commitment
made in the Good Friday Agreement—see
p. 16), prisoners serving sentences of five
years or more may make application for early
release from custody. Their eligibility for
release rests with the Sentence Review
Commission, whose members have been
approved by the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland.
Life Sentence Prisoners
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may only
be authorised in England and Wales by the
Home Secretary on the recommendation of
the Parole Board. The Home Secretary is
required to release prisoners serving life
sentences for offences other than murder after
an initial period set by the trial judge if so
directed by the Parole Board. Similar
procedures apply in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland the Secretary of State reviews life
sentence cases on the recommendation of an
internal review body.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain
on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall if their behaviour suggests
that they might again be a danger to the
public.
234
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Preparation for Release
Prisoners may be released on temporary
licence for short periods, but they are subject
to a rigorous risk assessment and are released
only for precisely defined and specific
activities which cannot be provided in prison
establishments.
Pre-release schemes in England and Wales
and in Scotland enable selected long-term
prisoners to spend some time before release in
certain units or prisons in order to help them
readapt to society and renew ties with their
families. Prisoners in such units work in paid
employment in the community and return to
the unit each evening. In Northern Ireland
there is also a pre-release system and, for long¬
term prisoners, extended Christmas and
summer home leave. Professional support is
given to offenders after release.
Probation
The Probation Service in England and Wales
supervises offenders in the community under
direct court orders and after release from
custody. It also advises offenders in custody. All
young offenders and all prisoners in England
and Wales sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment and over are supervised on release
by the Probation Service, or, in the case of
certain young offenders, by local authority social
services departments or youth justice teams.
A court probation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their probation
officer, who is expected to supervise them. The
Plans for a unified Probation Service to
replace the 54 autonomous, individual
services currently covering England and
Wales were announced by the
Government in April 1999. Under the
proposed new structure, the Service will
comprise 42 local operational areas,
matching police force boundaries, and be
led by a director who will be accountable
to the Home Secretary. Chief Probation
Officers, employed by the Home Office,
will manage each area.
purpose of supervision under a probation order
is to secure the rehabilitation of the offender, to
protect the public and to prevent the offender
from committing further offences. A probation
order can last from six months to three years;
an offender who fails to comply with any of the
requirements can be brought before the court
again. The Probation Service also administers
some supervision orders and supervises those
subject to community service orders and those
released from prison on parole.
HM Inspectorate of Probation has both an
inspection and an advisory role, and also
monitors any work that the Probation Service
carries out in conjunction with the voluntary
and private sectors.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals, and offenders subject to supervision
on release from custody.
In Northern Ireland the probation service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Legal Aid
Someone who needs legal advice, assistance or
representation may be able to get help with
legal costs from the legal aid scheme. People
who qualify for help may have all their legal
costs paid for, or may be asked to make a
contribution towards them, depending on
their means and, in civil cases, the outcome of
the case. Legally aided mediation is also
available on a means-tested basis for certain
family matters.
Legal Advice and Assistance
Legal advice is available under the Legal
Advice and Assistance (‘Green Form’)
Scheme in England and Wales. Those whose
income and capital are within certain limits are
entitled to free advice from a solicitor on most
legal matters. The scheme provides initially
for up to three hours’ work for matrimonial
cases where a petition is drafted, and two
hours for other work. Similar schemes operate
in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
At present civil legal aid may be available for
most civil proceedings to those who satisfy the
financial eligibility conditions and have
reasonable grounds for taking, defending or
being a party to proceedings. It may be
refused if, in the circumstances of the case, it
is considered unreasonable to grant it.
Payments to lawyers are made through the
Legal Aid Fund, administered by the Legal
Aid Board. Scotland has a separate Legal Aid
Fund, administered by the Scottish Legal Aid
Board. In Northern Ireland legal aid is
administered by the Law Society for Northern
Ireland.
An assisted person has some protection
against orders for costs being made against him
or her, and in certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover costs from the Legal
Aid Fund. Where the assisted person recovers
or preserves money or property in the
proceedings, the Legal Aid Fund will usually
have a first call on that money or property to
recover money spent on the assisted person’s
behalf (the ‘statutory charge’).
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In criminal proceedings legal aid may be
granted by the court if it appears to be in the
interests of justice and if a defendant is
considered to require financial assistance. A
contribution towards the costs may be payable.
The Legal Aid Board makes arrangements
for duty solicitors to assist unrepresented
defendants in the magistrates’ courts.
Solicitors are also available, on a 24-hour
basis, to give advice and assistance to those
being questioned by the police. T hese services
are not means-tested and are free.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal
cases in Northern Ireland it is free. There is a
voluntary duty solicitor scheme at the main
magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent people
in custody on their first appearance in the
sheriff courts and the district courts without
enquiry into the person’s means. In other
cases, a person seeking legal aid in summary
criminal proceedings must apply to the
Scottish Legal Aid Board, which must be
satisfied that the expenses of the case cannot
be met by the applicant without undue
hardship, and that it is in the interests of
justice that legal aid is awarded. In solemn
proceedings the court decides on the
availability of legal aid and must be satisfied
that the accused cannot meet the expenses of
the case without undue hardship. Where legal
aid is granted to the accused in criminal
proceedings, he or she is not required to pay
any contribution towards expenses.
Administrative Reform
England and Wales
The Access to Justice Act 1999 is reforming
the legal aid scheme and the provision of legal
services. In the year 2000 the Legal Aid Board
will be replaced by the Legal Services
Commission, which will run the scheme. The
Government also plans to establish a Criminal
Defence Service, which will replace criminal
legal aid. This will aim to ensure that people
accused of crime are properly defended, while
securing value for money and remaining
sensitive to the needs of victims and witnesses
and the public interest in the speedy
administration of justice. There will also be a
number of other changes:
• From January 2000 only franchised
organisations which have a contract with
the Legal Aid Board will be able to give
civil advice and assistance. This will also
apply to civil legal aid cases for family
matters.
• It is likely that legal aid will no longer be
available for most personal injury cases
(except clinical negligence). Most
personal injury cases will be brought
under ‘no win, no fee’ agreements
between solicitors and clients.
• The Community Legal Service will be
set up throughout England and Wales.
The Legal Services Commission will
work with local government authorities
236
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
and others to make sure people have
access to the legal services that they need.
Scotland
Since October 1998 all solicitors providing
criminal legal assistance must register with the
Scottish Legal Aid Board and conform to the
Board’s code of practice; a pilot scheme for
public defence solicitors employed by the
Board has been introduced to test alternative
ways of providing publicly funded legal
representation. Fixed payments for solicitors
providing legal aid in summary cases were
introduced in April 1999.
In 1998, the Government issued a
consultation paper (Access to Justice—Beyond
the Year 2000) on reforming civil legal
assistance, reflecting its aim of ensuring that
legal aid is properly targeted and cost-
effective. Responses to the consultation are
under consideration.
Other Legal Advice
In some urban areas law centres provide free
legal advice and representation. They may
employ a salaried lawyer and many have
community workers. Much of their time is
devoted to housing, employment, social
security and immigration problems.
Advice is also available in Citizens Advice
Bureaux, consumer and housing advice
centres, and from voluntary organisations.
The Legal Aid Board has entered into
contracts with some of these agencies to fund
the provision of legal aid and assistance.

Everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to religious freedom. Religious
organisations and groups may conduct their rites and ceremonies, promote
their beliefs within the limits of the law, own property and run schools. There is
no religious bar to the holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Christianity is the predominant religious
tradition in the UK in terms of the size of its
following, but there are also large Muslim,
Hindu, Jewish and Sikh communities, and
smaller communities of Baha’is, Buddhists,
Jains and Zoroastrians. Although members
within each community share many beliefs
and practices, there may be significant
differences of tradition, organisation, language
and ethnicity. There has been a significant
development of other forms of religious
expression, with the growth of a range of
independent churches and other groups often
referred to as ‘cults’ or ‘sects’ which have now
become known collectively as ‘new religious
movements’. Another recent trend has been
the rise in ‘New Age’ spirituality, drawn from
a variety of spiritual traditions and practices,
and characterised by a concern for ecology and
personal development. The UK also has a
large proportion of people who may actively
involve themselves in religious life only at
times of crisis or significant events such as
birth, marriage and death. Organisations such
as the British Humanist Association and the
National Secular Society offer non-religious
alternatives.

RELIGION
Relations with the State
There are two churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State, or established
churches, in the UK: in England the Anglican
Church of England, and in Scotland the
Presbyterian Church of Scotland. There is no
longer an established Church in Wales or
Northern Ireland. Ministers of the established
churches, as well as clergy belonging to other
religious groups, work in services run by the
State, such as the armed forces, national
hospitals and prisons, and may be paid a state
salary for such services.
Religious Education
In England and Wales all state schools must
provide religious education, each local
education authority being responsible for
producing a locally agreed syllabus. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity, while taking account
of the teaching and practices of the other
principal religions represented in the UK.
State schools must provide a daily act of
collective worship. Parents may withdraw
their children from religious education.
There are similar requirements in Scotland,
where education authorities must ensure that
schools practise religious observance and give
pupils religious instruction. The law does not
specify the form of such education but it is
recommended that pupils be provided with a
broad-based curriculum which gives a central
place to Christianity, encouraging tolerance
and respect of other religions.
In Northern Ireland a core syllabus for
religious education has been approved by the
main churches and this must be taught in all
state schools. Integrated education is
encouraged and all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, although in practice
most Catholic pupils attend Catholic
maintained or Catholic voluntary grammar
schools, and most Protestant children are
enrolled at controlled schools or non-
denominational voluntary grammar schools.
Church Alaintenance
The State does not contribute to the general
expenses of church maintenance although
some state aid does help repair historic
churches. In 1998-99, the joint scheme of
English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery
Fund offered grants to churches totalling
£12.2 million. Assistance is also given to meet
some of the costs of repairing cathedrals, with
£2.6 million made available in 1998-99.
Funding is not restricted to Church of
England buildings.
The Historic Chapels Trust was
established to take into ownership redundant
chapels and other places of worship in
England of outstanding architectural and
historic interest. Buildings of all
denominations and faiths are taken into care,
including Nonconformist chapels, Roman
Catholic churches, synagogues and private
Anglican chapels.
The Churches Conservation Trust
(formerly the Redundant Churches Fund) of
the Church of England preserves Anglican
churches of particular cultural importance that
are no longer used as regular places of
worship. At present 317 churches are being
maintained in this way.
Social Involvement
The Church of England’s Church Urban
Fund is an independent charity which raises
money to enable those living in the most
disadvantaged urban areas to set up local
projects to help alleviate the effects of poverty
on their lives. These projects help support a
wide range of community-based programmes
concerned with issues such as education,
employment, young people and poverty.
Although rooted in the Christian faith, the
Fund does not restrict its grants on the basis
of religious belief. By 1999 it had made grants
totalling £33 million to nearly 2,000 different
projects. In 1998, £3.6 million was awarded to
298 projects; 168 projects received grants of
between £2,000 and £50,000, and 130 projects
received between £200 and £2,000.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation, on social,
economic and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, it is the
largest voluntary social work agency in
Scotland. The Board currently runs and
239
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
manages more than 80 projects offering care
and support to over 4,000 people every day.
The Inner Cities Religious Council, based
in the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions, provides a forum
in which the Government and the faith
communities work together on issues relating
to urban regeneration in England. Chaired by
a government minister, the Council comprises
senior leaders of the Christian, Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh faiths.
The Census and Religious Affiliation
Questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
However, the Government White Paper The
2001 Census of Population (see p. 109),
published in March 1999, proposes that the
next census should include a question on
religion for England and W ales, subject to a
change in the Census Act 1920. It will be for
the Scottish Parliament to approve separate
legislation for Scotland if it chooses to do so.
The Sacred Land Project
The Sacred Land Project, a five-year
programme launched in 1997, is promoting
the environmental improvement of sacred
sites in the UK. It brings together religious,
conservation and heritage groups to undertake
specific projects, such as reopening historic
pilgrimage routes, and restoring or developing
sacred sites. The project has the support of the
major Christian denominations, other faith
traditions and environmental groups, and is
backed by the World Wide Fund for
Nature-UK and the Alliance of Religions and
Conservation.
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
Church of England
The Church of England became the established
church during the Reformation in the 16th
century. Conflicts between Church and State
culminated in the Act of Supremacy in 1534,
which repudiated papal supremacy and
declared Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head
of the Church of England. The title was altered
to ‘Supreme Governor’ by Elizabeth I when
she acceded to the throne in 1558. The Church
of England’s form of worship was set out in
successive versions of the Book of Common
Prayer from 1549 onwards. The Church’s
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation, since the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church of England and must always be
a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. The Church can regulate its own
worship. Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans of cathedrals are appointed
by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime
Minister, although the Crown Appointments
Commission, which includes lay and clergy
representatives, plays a key role in the
selection of archbishops and diocesan bishops.
All clergy swear allegiance to the Crown.
Clergy of the Church, together with those of
the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland
and the Roman Catholic Church, may not sit
in the House of Commons. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House of
Lords. The Government does not propose any
change in the transitional House of Lords (see
p. 41) in the representation of the Church of
England within the House.
The Church of England is divided into two
provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30
dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe; and
York, with 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
divided into archdeaconries and deaneries,
which are in turn divided into about 13,000
parishes, although in practice many of these
are grouped together. Altogether, there are
about 13,000 Church of England clergy,
excluding those in mainland Europe. In 1997,
189,000 people were baptised in the Church in
the two provinces, excluding the Diocese in
Europe; of these, 141,000 were under one year
old, representing 23% of live births. In the
same year there were 43,000 confirmations. In
1997, 80,000 marriages were solemnised in the
Church of England. These accounted for 66%
of all marriages with religious ceremonies, and
30% of all marriages in England.
In 1998 the General Synod, the central
governing and legislative body, approved
240
RELIGION
proposals to overhaul the central organisation
and structure of the Church. The number of
Church Commissioners (see below) was
reduced by two-thirds and some of their
powers transferred to an Archbishops’
Council which became the Church’s central
co-ordinating body. The Council, chaired by
the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
started work in early 1999 and comprises
bishops, clergy and lay members. It is the
centre of an administrative system dealing
with inter-church relations, inter-faith
relations, social questions, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and missionary
work. It also covers the care of church
buildings, church schools (which are largely
maintained from public funds), colleges and
institutes of higher education, voluntary and
parish education, and other church work in
the UK and overseas.
The Church Commissioners are responsible
for managing the greater part of the Church of
England’s assets. The Prime Minister appoints
an MP to the unpaid post of Second Church
Estates Commissioner to represent the
Commissioners in Parliament. Apart from the
Church Commissioners’ investment income,
most of the remainder of the Church’s income
is provided by local voluntary donations. The
average annual stipend of a Church of England
priest is about £15,760; additional benefits
include free housing (valued at £7,820) and a
non-contributory pension.
The Church of England reported an
increase in the ordination of new clergy
between 1997 and 1998 (from 410 to 476), and
in the number of people in training for
ordination. There are at present over 1,400
people in training.
The first women priests were ordained in
1994 and by 1998 they numbered 1,900.
Women priests cannot, however, be appointed
bishop or archbishop.
Other Anglican Churches
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
Communion of Anglican churches. These are
similar in organisation and worship to the
Church of England and originated from it.
There are four distinct Anglican Churches in
the British Isles: the Church of England, the
Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland (which
operates in both Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic). Each is governed separately
by its own institutions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 38
autonomous Churches in the UK and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas, with a total
membership of about 70 million. Links between
the components of the Anglican Communion
are maintained by the Lambeth Conference of
Anglican bishops, which is held in Canterbury
every ten years, the last conference having taken
place in 1998. Presided over by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Conference has no executive
authority, but enjoys considerable influence.
Issues debated at the 1998 Conference included
Third World debt, sexuality, human rights, and
relationships with other faiths.
The Anglican Consultative Council, an
assembly of lay people and clergy as well as
bishops, meets every two or three years to
allow consultation with the Anglican
Communion. The Primates Meeting brings
together the senior bishops from each Church
at similar intervals.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation in
the late 16th century and legislation enacted
by the Scottish Parliament. The Church’s
status was then consolidated in the Treaty of
Union of 1707 and by the Church of Scotland
Act 1921, the latter confirming its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church
appoints its own office bearers, and its affairs
are not subject to any civil authority.
The adult communicant membership is
over 660,000; and there are 1,167 ministers
serving in parishes. Both men and women may
join the ministry. The Church of Scotland has
a Presbyterian form of government, that is,
government by church courts or councils,
composed of ministers, elders (presbyters), all
of whom are ordained to office, and deacons.
The 1,300 churches are governed locally by
courts known as Kirk Sessions, consisting of
ministers and elders. The next court is the
Presbytery, responsible for a geographical area
made up of a number of parishes; and finally
241
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
there is the General Assembly, the supreme
court, consisting of elected ministers, elders
and deacons. The General Assembly meets
annually under the chairmanship of an elected
moderator, who serves for one year. The
Monarch is normally represented by the Lord
High Commissioner at the General Assembly.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland. They are very
active in the Highlands and Islands.
Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in the UK
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. Free Churches have existed in various
forms since the Reformation, developing their
own traditions over the years. Their members
have also been known as dissenters or
nonconformists. Although this historical
experience has given these churches a certain
sense of shared identity, they otherwise vary
greatly in doctrine, worship and church
government. All the major Free Churches—
Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—have ministers
of both sexes.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, originated in the 18th century
following the Evangelical Revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). It has 353,330 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.2
million. The present church is based on the
1932 union of most of the separate Methodist
Churches. It has 3,727 ministers and student
ministers and 6,452 places of worship.
MAYC, the youth service of the Methodist
Church, serves over 50,000 young people
between the ages of 13 and 25. Each year
MAYC organises a national youth event which
is one of the largest in Europe, bringing
together dance, drama, rock music and worship.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today they
are mainly organised in groups of churches,
most of which belong to the Baptist Union of
Great Britain (re-formed in 1812) with about
147,100 members, 1,780 ministers and 2,100
places of worship. There are also separate
Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland,
and other independent Baptist Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is the
United Reformed Church, with some 92,000
members, 950 serving ministers and 1,740
places of worship. It was formed in 1972 upon
the merger of the Congregational Church in
England and Wales (the oldest Protestant
minority in the UK, whose origins can be traced
back to the Puritans of the 16th century) with
the Presbyterian Church of England (a church
closely related in doctrine and worship to the
Church of Scotland). In 1981 there was a
further merger with the Reformed Association
of the Churches of Christ.
The Salvation Army was founded in the
East End of London in 1865 by William Booth
(1829-1912). Within the UK it is second only
to the Government as a provider of social
services. It is the largest provider of hostel
accommodation, offering almost 4,000 beds
every night. Other services include work with
alcoholics, prison chaplaincy and a family
tracing service which receives 5,000 enquiries
each year. The Salvation Army in the UK is
served by 1,600 officers (ordained ministers)
and runs over 800 worship centres.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,000 adult members
and 9,500 attenders in the UK and 490 places
of worship, was founded in the middle ol the
17th century under the leadership of George
Fox (1624-91). It has no ordained ministers
and no formal liturgy or sacraments. Silent
worship is central to its life as a religious
organisation and emphasis is also placed on
social concern and peacemaking.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where it
has around 300,000 members; the Presbyterian
(or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales,
with 49,750 members and the largest of the
Free Churches in Wales; and the Union of
Welsh Independents with 40,750 members.
Pentecostalist Organisations and
Charismatic Groupings
A recent development has been the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic
242
RELIGION
movement. A number of Pentecostalist bodies
were formed in the UK at the turn of the
century. The two main Pentecostalist
organisations in the UK today are the
Assemblies of God, with approximately 54,000
members, over 900 ministers and over 650
places of worship; and the Elim Pentecostal
Church. Since the Second World War
immigration from the Caribbean has led to a
significant number of Black majority
Pentecostalist churches.
In the early 1960s a Pentecostalist
charismatic movement began to influence some
followers in the Church of England, the Roman
Catholic Church and the historic Free
Churches. The Christian ‘house church’
movement (or ‘new churches’) began in the
1970s when some of the charismatics began to
establish their own congregations. Services
were originally held in private houses although
many congregations have now acquired their
own buildings. The movement, whose growth
within the UK has been most marked in
England, is characterised by lay leadership and
is organised into a number of loose fellowships,
usually on a regional basis, such as the Ichthus
Fellowship in south-east London.
Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which was
suppressed after the Reformation, was
restored in 1850, and that of the Scottish
Roman Catholic Church, suppressed in the
early 17th century, in 1878. There are now
seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great
Britain, each under an archbishop; and 30
dioceses each under a bishop—22 in England
and Wales and eight in Scotland. There are
2,843 parish churches in England and Wales
and 828 other churches and chapels open to
the public. Scotland has 463 parish churches.
The Catholic Church in Ireland is
organised as a unit covering the whole island.
There are 1,329 parishes, and, as many
parishes have more than one church, 2,646
churches. Northern Ireland is covered by
seven dioceses, some of which also have
territory in the Irish Republic.
There are approximately 12,000 members
of religious orders in England, Scotland and
Wales. These orders undertake teaching and
chaplaincy, and social work such as nursing,
childcare and running homes for the elderly.
Other Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
go back to the Reformation. The Christian
Brethren are a Protestant body organised by
J.N. Darby (1800-82). There are two
branches: the Open Brethren and the Closed
or Exclusive Brethren.
Many Christian communities founded by
migrant communities, including the
Orthodox, Lutheran and Reformed Churches
of various European countries, the Coptic
Orthodox Church and the Armenian Church,
have established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest
is probably the Greek Orthodox Church,
many of whose members are of Cypriot origin.
There are also several other religious
groups in the UK which were founded in the
United States in the last century. These
include the Church of Jesus Christ of the
Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church, with
about 180,000 members), the Jehovah’s
Witnesses (146,000 members), the
Christadelphians, the Christian Scientists, and
the Seventh-Day Adventists. The Spiritualists
have about 36,000 members, over 500
churches and nearly 300 ministers.
Co-operation among the Churches
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland is
the main co-ordinating body for the Christian
churches in the UK. The Council co¬
ordinates the work of its 32 member churches
and associations of churches, in the areas of
social responsibility, international affairs,
church life, world mission, racial justice and
inter-faith relations. The Council’s member
churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales, and the Irish Council of
Churches.
243
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Free Churches’ Council, with 19
member denominations, includes most of the
Free Churches of England and Wales. It
promotes co-operation among the Free
Churches (especially in hospital chaplaincy
and in education matters).
The Evangelical Alliance, with a
membership of individuals, churches or
societies drawn from 20 denominations,
represents over 1 million evangelical
Christians.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within the UK, and the main
participants are the Anglican, Baptist,
Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox, Reformed
and Roman Catholic Churches. In 1999 the
Church of England and the Methodist Church
began formal discussions on a move towards
unity. The Baptist Union, the Moravian
Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the
United Reformed Church had participating
observers at the discussions. Informal trilateral
contact between the Church of England, the
Methodist Church and the United Reformed
Church also began in 1999.
OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES
The Buddhist Community
The Buddhist community in the UK has
followers both of British or Western origin,
and of South Asian and Asian background. In
1907, a Buddhist Society of Great Britain and
Ireland was formed but did not become firmly
established. In 1924 Christmas Humphreys
(1901-83) founded the Buddhist Centre of the
Theosophical Society from what remained of
the earlier society. This became the Buddhist
Lodge of the Theosophical Society in 1926,
and was constituted as a new and independent
organisation—the Buddhist Society—in 1943.
The Society promotes the principles, but does
not adhere to any particular school, of
Buddhism. The Network of Buddhist
Organisations represents many of the various
Buddhist educational, cultural, charitable and
teaching organisations.
Although religious buildings are not as
central to Buddhist life as to that of some
other religious traditions, there are well over
500 Buddhist groups and centres, including
some 50 monasteries and temples in the UK.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in the UK originates
largely from India, although others have come
from countries to which earlier generations
had previously migrated, such as Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Malawi.
Migrants have also come from Fiji and from
Trinidad and other Caribbean islands. It is
estimated that the number of members is
around 400,000 to 550,000, although some
community representatives suggest a
considerably higher figure (of close to 1
million). They are predominantly Gujaratis
(between 65% and 70%) and Punjabis
(between 15% and 20%). Most of the
remainder have their ancestral roots in other
parts of India such as Uttar Pradesh, West
Bengal, and the Southern states, as well as
other countries such as Sri Lanka.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in the 1950s and there are
now over 120 mandirs in the UK; many are
affiliated to the National Council of Hindu
Temples (UK). Other national bodies serving
the Hindu community include the Hindu
Council (UK) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad.
The Swaminarayan Hindu Temple, in
north London, is the first purpose-built
Hindu temple in Europe, having a large
cultural complex with provision for
conferences, exhibitions, marriages, sports and
health clinics.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest. They were banished by
royal decree in 1290, but readmitted following
the English Civil War (1642—51). Sephardi
Jews, who originally came from Spain and
Portugal, have been present in the UK since
the mid-17th century. The majority of Jews in
the UK today are Ashkenazi Jews, of Central
and East European origin, who fled
persecution in the Russian Empire between
1881 and 1914, and Nazi persecution in
Germany and other European countries from
1933 onwards.
244
RELIGION
The Jewish community in the UK numbers
about 285,000, and about 70% are affiliated to
synagogues. Of these, most Ashkenazi Jews
(60%) acknowledge the authority of the Chief
Rabbi, while the more strictly observant (7%)
have their own spiritual leaders, as do the
Sephardim. The Reform movement (founded
in 1840), the Liberal and Progressive movement
(founded in 1901) and the recently established
Masorti movement, account for most of the
remaining 30% of synagogue members.
Jewish congregations in the UK number
about 365. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for these groups. Founded in 1760, it is
elected mainly by synagogues, but a growing
number of communal organisations are also
represented. The Board serves as the voice of
the community to both government and the
wider non-Jewish community.
Roughly two in every five Jewish children
aged 5 to 17 attend Jewish day schools, some
of which are supported by public funds. Over
100 agencies provide welfare services
throughout the community.
The Muslim Community
A significant Muslim community has existed
in the UK since Muslim seamen and traders,
from the Middle East and the Indian
subcontinent, settled around the major ports
in the early 19th century. There was further
settlement from those demobilised from
military service in the British army after the
First World War, and of workers seeking, or
recruited for, employment in the mills and
factories in the 1950s and 1960s because of a
shortage of labour following the Second
World War. The 1970s saw the arrival of large
numbers of Muslims of Asian origin from
Kenya and Uganda. There are also well-
established Turkish Cypriot and Iranian
Muslim communities, while more recently
Muslims from Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia and
Kosovo have sought refuge in the UK. It is
estimated that there are between 1.5 million
and 2 million Muslims in the UK and
estimates from within the community suggest
that the proportion of young people in
demographic terms is significantly higher than
the national average.
There are over 600 mosques and numerous
community Muslim centres throughout the
UK. Mosques are not only places of worship;
they also offer instruction in the Muslim way
of life and facilities for education and welfare.
The first mosque in the UK was established at
Woking, Surrey, in 1890. Mosques now range
from converted houses in many towns to the
Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, London,
and its associated Islamic Cultural Centre, one
of the most important Muslim institutions in
the western world. The Central Mosque has
the largest congregation in the UK, and
during festivals it may number over 30,000.
The main conurbations in the Midlands,
North West and North East of England and in
Scotland also have their own central mosques
with a range of community facilities.
Sunni and Shi’a are the two principal
traditions within Islam and both are
represented among the Muslim community in
the UK. Sufism, the mystical aspect of Islam,
can be found in both traditions, and members
of some of the major Sufi traditions have also
developed branches in British cities.
The Muslim Council of Britain, founded in
1997, is a representative body of established
national and regional Muslim bodies as well as
local mosques, organisations and specialist
institutions. The Council aims to promote
co-operation, consensus and unity on Muslim
affairs in the UK.
The Sikh Community
Most of the Sikh community in the UK are of
Punjabi ethnic origin. A significant minority
came from East Africa and other former British
colonies to which members of their family had
migrated, but the vast majority have come to
the UK directly from the Punjab. It is
estimated that there are between 400,000 and
500,000 members, making it the largest Sikh
community outside the Indian subcontinent.
The first gurdwara, or temple, in the UK
was opened in Shepherd’s Bush, London, in
1911. The largest is situated in Southall,
Middlesex. Gurdwaras cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural needs
of their community. A granthi is usually
employed to take care of the building and to
conduct prayers. There are over 200
245
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
gurdwaras in the UK, the vast majority being
in England and Wales.
Other Faiths
Jainism is an ancient religion brought to the UK
by immigrants mainly from the Gujarat and
Rajasthan areas of India. It is estimated that
there are between 25,000 and 30,000 members in
the UK. The Zoroastrian religion, or Mazdaism,
is mainly represented in the UK by the Parsi
community, whose ancestors left Iran in the 9th
century and settled in north-west India.
Founders of the UK community originally
settled in the 19th century and it is estimated
there are between 5,000 and 10,000 members.
The Baha’i movement originated in Persia in
the 19th century. The UK community has
around 6,000 members connected to 200 local
groups and 180 local spiritual assemblies.
Rastafarianism, with its roots in the return-to-
Africa movement, emerged in the West Indies
early in the 20th century. It arrived in the UK
with immigration from Jamaica in the 1950s.
New Religious Movements
A number of new religious movements,
established since the Second World War and
often with overseas origins, are active in the
UK. Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement, the Unification Church and
various New Age groups. INFORM
(Information Network Focus on Religious
Movements), which is supported by the main
Churches, carries out research and seeks to
provide objective information about new
religious movements.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
The Inter Faith Network for the United
Kingdom links a wide range of organisations
with an interest in inter-faith relations,
including the representative bodies of the
Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian
communities. The Network promotes good
relations between faiths in the UK and runs a
public advice and information service on
inter-faith issues. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding
among members of the two religions and deals
with educational and social issues. Churches
Together in Britain and Ireland (see p. 243)
has a Commission on Inter Faith Relations.
There are now many organisations in the UK
dealing wholly, or in part, with inter-faith
issues. Many towns and cities now have inter¬
faith councils or groups whose focus is
working for good inter-faith relations locally.
Faith and the Year 2000
In the UK many national and civic millennium
celebrations will have a specifically Christian
framework. However, the Government wants
to ensure that the celebrations are relevant and
accessible to people of all faiths. Marking the
Millennium in a Multi-Faith Context, published
by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport in association with the Inter Faith
Network, gives guidance to events organisers
on how to make the millennium celebrations
inclusive of both Christians and followers of
other faiths. Many local congregations are
planning activities and events under three
themes: ‘a new start with God’, ‘a new start at
home’ and ‘a new start for the world’s poor’.
Local churches will be distributing a special
millennium candle pack to every household in
December 1999.

The biggest ever reform of cultural funding and organisation is encouraging
wider access to, and excellence and innovation in, the arts, to improve the
quality of people’s lives. It involves extra grants of £290 million among cultural
institutions in England during 1999-2002, while the Arts Council of England
will allot 15% more funding in 1999-2000 than in 1998-99. Thirteen out of 24
Academy Awards in 1999 went to artists working on films shot largely in the
UK. The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh is the first national museum
to be built in Britain for 120 years.
The UK’s cultural life flourished in 1998-99,
with more opera, music of all kinds, dance,
drama, art and film than ever before. The
newly restored Royal Opera House in London
is on target to reopen in November 1999.
Opera audiences in the UK are steadily
increasing, with 3 million adults claiming to be
attenders. Enthusiasm for British pop, rock
and jazz shows no sign of diminishing. British
ballet companies have programmes at home
and overseas. Some of the UK’s most
favourably reviewed theatrical productions
have been exported with success, while
leading US performers have been applauded
in the UK. London has been host to
outstanding art exhibitions, one of them
giving rise to the UK’s first 24-hour art show.
There has also been unprecedented praise,
and awards, for recent films, either UK-
funded or made in Britain, with British
players, directors, writers and technicians.
In November 1998 the Creative Industries
Task Force (CITF—see p. 248) reported that
The fascination of Shakespeare for
audiences and readers is undiminished.
His enduring and growing appeal, it was
said, transcended cultural, social, historical
and linguistic boundaries. A BBC Radio 4
poll named him ‘personality of the
millennium’ and critics held him to have
had greater influence on European
literature than any other writer.
UK creative industries (including music,
television and radio, software, theatre, film,
publishing, design, architecture, fashion,
crafts and antiques), with a current annual
growth rate of 5%, generate £60 billion of
revenue a year and employ over 1.4 million
people, with potential to create 50,000 new
jobs over the next three years. The export
market in creative goods and services is about
£7.5 billion a year. Britain’s share of
international exports in the cultural sector, at
just over 16%, is three times greater than its
247
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
share of world trade overall. British talent is
behind two out of every five successful computer
games in the world; British publishing firms are
worth £16.3 billion, design £12 billion, and
television and radio £6.4 billion.
Government Policy
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) determines government policy
and administers expenditure on national
museums and art galleries in England, the
Arts Council of England (see below), the
British Library and other national arts and
heritage bodies. Other responsibilities include
the regulation of the film and music
industries, broadcasting and the press, the
National Lottery and the export licensing of
antiques.
The National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland
Assembly have taken over responsibility for
the arts in their countries, including
museums, galleries and libraries, and their
respective Arts Councils (see below).
Government funds are distributed to arts
organisations indirectly, through bodies such
as the Arts Councils, the British Film Institute
(bfi) and Scottish Screen. In the most wide-
ranging reform of UK cultural institutions for
decades, the DCMS budget of £912 million is
to be raised to £1,038 million by 2001-02,
with an extra £290 million to be spent on the
arts, media and sport, a rise in real terms of
5.5%. From this extra funding, £99 million is
to go to museums and galleries, with provision
for the removal of all entry charges for
national collections sponsored by the DCMS
by 2001, and £125 million to the performing
and visual arts. (An additional £31 million has
been made available for the arts in Scotland
during 1999-2002.)
The reform includes:
• new arrangements to support the crafts at
national level while safeguarding the
work that the Crafts Council currently
does;
• creation of a national body to champion
architecture, taking on the Royal Fine
Art Commission’s design review role and
the Arts Councils’ awards programmes;
• a single Film Council to develop film
culture and the film industry;
• a Museums, Libraries and Archives
Council to replace the Museums &
Galleries Commission (see p. 261) and
the Library and Information
Commission;
• DCMS representation in the
Government Offices for the Regions (see
P- 9);
• three-year funding agreements with most
sponsored bodies, coupled with
responsibilities to fulfil their targets; and
• establishment of a Quality, Efficiency
and Standards Team (QUEST) to
monitor financial management across
DCMS sectors.
The CITF identifies key issues vital to the
economic health of the creative industries.
Among its present priorities are developing
skills among the creative workforce;
improving access to funding for their
businesses; maximising exports; ensuring
copyright protection of intellectual property;
and focusing on more regional activity.
Arts Councils
The independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
main channels for the distribution of
government grants and lottery funding to the
visual, performing, community arts and
literature. The Arts Councils give financial
assistance and advice not only to the major
performing arts organisations, but also to
small touring theatre companies, experimental
performance groups and literary organisations.
They provide funds for training arts
administrators and help to develop
sponsorship and local authority support. They
also promote education and public access to,
and participation in, performing and visual
arts and literature.
The Arts Council of England (ACE) is the
authority for the arts in England and acts as
their ‘champion’. It rewards quality through
its annual award allocations and through its
stabilisation programme, which helps arts
organisations manage long-term change. The
248
CULTURE
ACE’s Recovery Programme is designed to
provide rapid, shorter-term help to arts
organisations with pressing financial
difficulties.
The ACE is delegating funding decisions for
many arts companies to the ten Regional Arts
Boards (RABs), which assumed extended
responsibilities from April 1999 and deal with
an average 19% increase in allocation for
1999-2000. Other sources of money for the
RABs are the bfi and local authorities. The
ACE will continue to decide awards to the
Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, the Birmingham
Royal Ballet, English National Opera, the Royal
Shakespeare Company (RSC), the Royal
National Theatre and the South Bank Centre;
and to the main touring companies, such as
Opera North and English National Ballet.
The Arts Council of Wales’s Collectorplan
Scheme (established in 1987 and the largest
such scheme in the UK) has handled some
13,400 loans valued at over £4.3 million,
enabling the public to buy about 16,000 works
of art.
Finance
In England planned central government
expenditure through the DCMS in 1999-2000
amounts to £219.7 million for museums and
galleries; £228 million for the visual and
performing arts; £103.7 million for broadcasting
and the media (including film); and £89.7
million for libraries. Funding for the arts is
channelled mainly through the ACE, which has
a grant of £227.3 million in 1999-2000 (an
increase of £37.9 million on 1998-99), including
the Pairing Scheme for the Arts (see p. 250) and
funding for Crafts. In addition, all four Arts
Councils distribute National Lottery proceeds,
amounting to about £265 million a year (£227.8
million for the ACE).
Planned 1999-2000 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is respectively £28.4 million, £14.8
million and £6.9 million, between 3% and 4%
up on 1998-99. The Scottish Executive is also
providing £42 million for Scotland’s National
Galleries and Museums, National Library and
film industry, while the National Assembly for
Wales is giving some £35 million for Wales’s
National Museum, National Library and other
arts. Planned spending by the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland on the
National Museums (see p. 263) and arts
amounts to £7.5 million in 1999-2000.
National Lottery
By December 1998, Lottery awards of some
£1.3 billion had been announced by the Arts
Councils for arts projects. Grants for the
acquisition of works of art from the Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF—see p. 328) to
museums, galleries and other organisations
between June 1995 and April 1999 amounted
to £49.7 million. The Lottery’s New
Opportunities Fund, launched in January
1999, is developing a network of community
centres, linked to libraries and the National
Grid for Learning (see p. 128), to open up
access to information. Millennium Festival
Awards for All, allowing community
organisations to apply for grants of up to
£5,000, has been available throughout Great
Britain from April 1999. Larger one-off
Lottery awards, for example to Chester’s
Gateway Theatre (£23,200) and to Ilkley’s
Literature Festival (£20,000), support
millennium arts projects. Among substantial
awards in Scotland are £1.4 million to the
Pitlochry Festival Society for upgrading
facilities. The Millennium Theatre in
Londonderry, which has received £2.5
million, will open at the end of 2000.
NESTA
The National Endowment for Science,
Technology and the Arts has initial finance of
£200 million from the National Lottery. It
aims to help talented individuals or groups to
develop their full potential; to turn creativity
into products and services that are effectively
exploited with rights effectively protected; and
to contribute to public knowledge and
appreciation of science, technology and the
arts. It launched its first programmes in
summer 1999.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain about 1,000 local
museums and art galleries, and a network of
249
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
public libraries (see p. 265). They also provide
grant aid for professional and amateur
orchestras, theatres, and opera and dance
companies. In England total expenditure on
museums, galleries and libraries for 1998-99
was £941 million. Fourteen authorities are to
pilot Local Cultural Strategies, a DCMS
scheme to bring cultural issues into the heart
of local government planning in 1999-2000.
The Corporation of London, the local
authority for the City of London, is one of the
largest sponsors of the arts in the UK, with a
budget of £46 million in 1998-99 from various
funds. The Corporation owns, funds and
manages the Barbican Centre (Europe’s
largest multi-arts and conference centre),
which has the London Symphony Orchestra
and RSC as residents; owns, funds and
manages the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama; and jointly funds and manages the
Museum of London with the DCMS.
Business and Other Sponsorship
Total UK business investment in the arts rose
by 20% in 1997-98, to a record £115 million.
London attracted most of the investment—
£48.8 million—followed by Scotland and the
West Midlands. Theatre, and museums and
galleries, received £20 million each; music
£11 million; and opera £8 million.
Sponsorship in kind increased by over 20%,
to £9.2 million. As one example, EDS, the US
IT services company, is investing £2 million
in the £6 million Lowry Centre at
Manchester.
Sponsorship from charitable trusts has also
been notable. The Weston Foundation, for
example, has contributed £20 million towards
the £97.9 million needed to complete the
freeing and covering of the British Museum s
Great Court. From the Jerwood Foundation
some £3 million has gone towards the renewal
of the Royal Court theatre in London, and a
further £500,000 to the UK’s third sculpture
park, at Witley Court (Worcestershire). The
Helen Hamlyn Foundation has given £1
million to finance a design centre at the Royal
College of Art to work out design solutions to
the social problems of the future. In 1998, the
first year of a three-year scheme, the Paul
Hamlyn Foundation awarded prizes ot
£30,000 each to five young British exponents
of visual art.
Arts & Business (formerly ABSA) exists to
promote and encourage partnerships between
business and the arts. It has over 350 business
members and manages the Pairing Scheme on
behalf of the ACE and DCMS. Under the
scheme, government funding of between £500
and £25,000 is awarded to arts organisations
to match or part match sponsorship that they
have secured from businesses. The scheme
awards 50% match funding for first-time
sponsors, 100% match funding for projects
which give exceptional access to the arts and
100% for the first year of projects supported
by first-time sponsors who commit to a three-
year contract. In 1998-99 the scheme attracted
£8.5 million from business and since 1984 has
contributed over £145 million (including £47
million from the Government) to the arts.
First prize of £100,000, out of 400
nominations, in the Arts & Business first
Creative Britons awards in 1999 went to
Mary Ward for her Chicken Shed theatre
for children (able-bodied and disabled),
which, among other productions,
organised 1,000 young people from 22
London boroughs in a Caribbean musical
at the Royal Albert Hall. With a Lottery
award she is opening a purpose-built
theatre at Southgate in north London,
providing performance space for a 650-
strong company.
Some £4 million from the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts, run by the Pools
Promoters Association, was used to help the
arts in 1998 in the form of awards. Many arts
organisations also benefit from the fund¬
raising activities of Friends groups and from
private individuals’ financial support.
Cultural Diversity
The Arts Councils promote cultural diversity
in the arts. The Scottish Arts Council (SAC),
for example, is funding the Sikh festival
Vaisakhi da Mela in Glasgow and the African
and Caribbean Resource Centre in Scotland.
CAMDAD, funded by the Arts Council of
250
CULTURE
Wales, runs a cultural diversity training
programme for artists and arts organisations.
Measures to foster cultural diversity in
Northern Ireland include funding for arts in
both the Irish language and Ulster Scots. The
Councils encourage the growth of Caribbean
carnival across the UK, of which the most
famous is the annual Netting Hill Carnival,
the largest street festival in Europe, now
sponsored by Western Union. In recent years
the Belfast Carnival has attracted an
international audience. The Mu-len Theatre
Company has launched its own British-
Oriental youth drama group, thought to be the
first of its type in the UK.
The Arts and Disability
The National Disability Arts Forum and other
similar national agencies are funded by the
ACE, as are creative organisations, such as
Candoco, a company of disabled and non¬
disabled dancers. The ACE also supports an
apprenticeship scheme for disabled people in
major arts organisations, such as the RSC,
which is part of an initiative aimed at
increasing employment opportunities for
disabled people in the arts; and projects
involving disabled artists in schools. The SAC
supports Art Link and Project Ability, which
help the disabled to develop their creativity.
Provision of access for disabled people to
arts buildings is a criterion for all grants made
from the National Lottery (see p. 121).
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in the UK give people the
chance of seeing a range of specialist art and of
taking part in activities, especially educational
projects. Nearly all the centres are professionally
managed, while using the services of volunteers.
They are assisted mainly by the Arts Councils,
RABs and local authorities, while the ACE
currently funds two national centres, the South
Bank Centre and the Institute of Contemporary
Arts (ICA), both in London. ARC, at Stockton
on Tees, with a 600-seat auditorium, two
theatres, a cinema, rehearsal spaces and a digital
arts suite, opened in January 1999. Chapter Arts
Centre in Cardiff helps to promote international
artists and collaborations.
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 96) promotes
international understanding of British
creativity internationally in the arts, literature
and design, and highlights Britain’s cultural
diversity. In 1998 it supported nearly 3,000
cultural events overseas. It works with a range
of artists, including Rastafarian poet Benjamin
Zephaniah, the RSC, painter Gary Hume and
author A.S. Byatt. The Visiting Arts Office of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a joint
venture of the British Council with the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, the Arts
Councils and the Crafts Council. It
encourages the inward flow to the UK of arts
from other countries
Broadcasting
Arts programmes broadcast by BBC radio and
television and the independent companies (see
chapter 17) have won many international
awards, such as at the Prix Italia and
Montreux International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies also give
grants for arts promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting has created its own art forms—
nothing like the arts documentary or drama
series exists in any other medium. For
example, in an arts documentary in April
1999, Gwyneth Jones talked on BBC Radio 3
about her career as a leading Wagnerian
soprano and the techniques and training
needed to sustain such demanding roles.
In 1998 Channel 4’s Granton Star Cause
(from a story by Irvine Welsh) won the Prix
Italia for single drama, and British television
productions won half the major titles in the
international Emmy awards, which honour the
best shows made outside the United States.
Among these successes were BBCl’s The
Vicar ofDibley (with Dawn French) and the
children’s series Blabbermouth and Sticky Beak
(also Channel 4). For her role in Waiting for
the Telegram, one of Alan Bennett’s Talking
Heads monologues (BBC2), the 87-year-old
Thora Hird won the 1998 Royal Television
Society’s Actress of the Year award and the
BAFTA television award for Best Actress.
Other BAFTA awards went to Tom
Courtenay for Best Actor in A Rather English
,
251
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Marriage (BBC2), which also won the prize
for Best Single Drama. BBC2’s adaptation of
Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend won the award
for Best Drama Serial.
The BBC has five orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on Radio
3 (see p. 274). BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock
and pop music, and much of the output of
BBC Radio 2 is popular and light music. Of
the two national commercial radio stations
which broadcast music, Classic FM offers
mainly classical and Virgin Radio plays rock.
Much of the output of the UK’s local radio
stations is popular and light music.
For its 1999 Promenade Concerts (the
‘Proms’), the world’s largest music festival,
the BBC commissioned seven works from five
British and two overseas composers, including
a Flute Concerto by Richard Rodney Bennett
and Inside Story (for violin, viola and
orchestra) by Piers Hellawell. 1 he Proms
opened with Tippett’s The Mask of Time. The
20th Prom was devoted to 100 Years of Film
Music, the 43rd was a centenary celebration of
the jazz legend Duke Ellington, and the 66th
and 67th featured the Vienna Philharmonic
under Simon Rattle. The second half of the
72nd (Last Night) was relayed on a giant
screen to 35,000 people in Hyde Park and to
similar events in Swansea and Birmingham.
Festivals
Some 500 professional arts festivals take place
in the UK each year. Cinemagic, the first
international children’s film festival, established
in Belfast in 1990, has become a national
resource, touring seven UK cities in 1998. The
1999 Edinburgh International Festival featured
167 performances of music, theatre, opera and
dance, opening with Handel’s oratorio Saul,
under Charles Mackerras (with soprano Joan
Rodgers, tenor Ian Bostridge and baritone Bryn
Terfel, three major British singers, among the
soloists, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and
the Festival Chorus). Three performances by
Sweden’s Cullberg Ballet were arranged by
their radical choreographer Mats Ek. The
Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with programmes
(including street events) to suit all tastes and
persuasions, takes place alongside the main
events. In 1999 there were over 15,000
performances by 600 different companies.
Other Edinburgh events include the
International Film and Television Festivals and
the annual Book Festival.
In 1999 the 52nd Aldeburgh Festival began
with the opera by its artistic director, Thomas
Ades, Powder Her Face, which has been
performed worldwide since its 1995 premiere.
Alfred Brendel played Haydn, Mozart and
Schubert, and also read from his own poems.
For a calendar of the main arts events in the
UK in 2000, see Appendix 5, p. 547.
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
Since 1992, one city, town or region in the
UK has been nominated, through
competition, to celebrate a particular art form,
with the help of Arts Council and matching
funds. Glasgow was the City of Architecture
and Design for 1999. The year 2000 will be
Year of the Artist, covered by a national
programme.
DRAMA
At the turn of the century, audiences in
London were enjoying a wide range of
high-quality cultural performances. In 1901
Sir Henry Irving opened his season with
Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, and Sarah
Bernhardt was in London to play in
Rostand’s L 'Aiglon and Cyrano de Bergerac.
In 1902, at His Majesty’s Theatre, Sir
Herbert Beerbohm Tree produced
Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives oj Windsor,
with Ellen Terry and Madge Kendal; in
1903 Mrs Patrick Campbell starred in a
revival of Pinero’s The Second Mrs
Tanqueray, in 1904 J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan
at the Duke of York’s (with Gerald Du
Maurier as Captain Hook and Nina
Boucicault as Peter) brought ‘the very spirit
of childhood on to the stage’; and 1905 saw
the opening of Shaw’s Man and Superman
at the Court Theatre.
252
CULTURE
Repertory, whereby a group of actors takes
part in more than one play during a given
period, and initiatives to revive interest in
regional theatre were features of 1998-99.
Trevor Nunn at the Royal National Theatre
(RNT), for example, has formed a repertory
company to perform four plays together, and
Ian McKellen spent six months in repertory at
the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. In
1998 ‘See it Live—Barclays Theatre Week’ at
more than 100 theatres outside London aimed
to persuade first-time, infrequent and lapsed
theatregoers to see that week’s local or touring
production through special ticket offers. The
ACE and RABs are spending more than .£50
million to support drama, including regional
theatre, in 1999-2000—27% of the ACE’s
total grant. In Scotland, Dundee Repertory
Theatre received a £2.3 million Lottery award
in 1999 for building improvements to expand
its range of work.
Highlights of the UK theatrical year
included the unveiling of the restored neo¬
baroque ceiling of Liverpool’s Empire
Theatre, at a cost of £10.5 million, of which
£7.5 million came from the National Lottery.
Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre,
severely damaged in 1996 by a bomb,
reopened in December 1998 (a £2.3 million
Lottery award helping towards its restoration)
with the play whose run had been halted
(Stanley Houghton’s Hindle Wakes). Belfast’s
Grand Opera House, a 1,000-seat Victorian
theatre which presents opera, drama, ballet
and musicals, won the Barclays award for
Most Welcoming Theatre. In London the
remains of the Rose (1587-1606), the theatre
of Christopher Marlowe and the young
Shakespeare, were saved for permanent
exhibition and, it is hoped, further excavation.
At the end of 1998 Glasgow Citizens
Theatre staged a triptych of plays to great
acclaim: Seneca’s Medea (in modern dress),
Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming, and David
Mamet’s Oleanna. At the same time, Clwyd
Theatr, Cymru (based at Mold in Flintshire),
‘the national theatre of Wales’, enhanced its
reputation with Terry Hands’s direction of
Alan Ayckbourn’s trilogy The Norman
Conquests. John Wood’s performance as A.E.
Housman in Tom Stoppard’s The Invention of
Love, which moved from the RNT to the
In 1998-99 London’s two small, off-centre
theatres, the Almeida and the Donmar,
continued to excel, and to attract big-name
actors willing to work for nominal wages.
Almeida productions showed in the West
End: Diana Rigg, Toby Stephens and
Barbara Jefford in Ted Hughes’s and
Robert David MacDonald’s versions of
Racine’s tragedies Britannicus and Phedre,
and Cate Blanchett in David Hare’s Plenty.
At the Donmar two leading ladies from the
United States enjoyed admiring notices:
Nicole Kidman joined Iain Glen in Hare’s
The Blue Room and Elizabeth McGovern
played opposite Colin Firth in Richard
Greenberg’s Three Days of Rain. The Blue
Room and the Almeida production of
Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh, with
Kevin Spacey and Tim Pigott-Smith,
moved successfully to New York, as did
Patrick Marber’s Closer, for which Rupert
Graves, Ciaran Hinds, Anna Friel, and
Marber took the 1999 Theatre World
awards for most outstanding new
performances (with Closer best foreign
play), and WaxCs Amy’s View, another
triumph for Judi Dench, for which
advance ticket sales reached £3 million.
The Iceman Cometh took two 1999
Olivier awards: for Best Actor (Kevin
Spacey) and for Best Director (Howard
Davies); Eileen Atkins won Best Actress
for Yasmina Reza’s The Unexpected Maw,
the RNT’s Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and
Dick, by Terry Johnson, was Best
Comedy, while its production of
Oklahoma! won four awards, among them
Outstanding Musical Production.
West End, was described by one critic as ‘the
greatest piece of acting to be seen in London’.
Stoppard became the first living foreign
playwright to have his work performed at the
Comedie Fran9aise in Paris when his Arcadia
opened there in November 1998. Success in
France had also been won by Declan
Donnellan, whose direction of Corneille’s Le
Cid was regarded as the hit of the Avignon
festival the previous summer. At a ceremony
at the Bolshoi in Moscow in April 1999 he
won Russia’s Golden Mask award for his
253
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
direction of Shakespeare’s The Winter's Tale
(designed by Nick Ormerod) with Maly
Drama Theatre in St Petersburg, a production
which moved to the UK. Among notable RSC
offerings have been Richard III, with Robert
Lindsay in the title role; A Midsummer Night’s
Dream, with Josette Simon as Titania and
Hippolyta; and Biyi Bandele’s adaptation of
Aphra Behn’s novel Oroonoko (1688), the trials
of an African prince made slave. The RNT’s
programme in 1999 included Hanif Kureshi s
first play for it, Sleep with Me, and a revival of
Noel Coward’s Private Lives (1930—with
Juliet Stevenson). A return to all-male
Shakespeare productions was a feature of the
third Globe season; artistic director Mark
Rylance playing the Egyptian queen in Antony
and Cleopatra. Praise for its ‘dreamlike beauty’
was typical of the notices won by The Street of
Crocodiles, a production of Theatre de
Complicite, a British enterprise funded by the
ACE and London Arts Board, and supported
by the British Council, which has toured in 41
countries and won 25 international awards
under its artistic director, Simon McBurney.
Some of the UK’s 300 professional theatres
are privately owned, but most belong to local
authorities or to non-profit-making
organisations. The tiny Mull Theatre in the
Hebrides has 43 seats; its company tours the
Highlands and Islands and runs an education
programme.
London
London’s 100 or so theatres include:
• the RNT, which stages modern and
classical plays in its three auditoriums on
the South Bank;
• the Barbican Centre, which has two
auditoriums, is home for half the year to
the RSC, with a varied drama
programme for the other half, including
the Barbican International Theatre
Event; and
• the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane
Square, home to the English Stage
Company, which specialises in new work
and reopened in 1999.
In 1998 the average West End attendance
for each performance increased to 744. I otal
West End takings were up £11.8 million to
just over £257.9 million.

Theatre for Young People
The annual National Connections youth
programme is sponsored by BT (£600,000):
some 150 groups chosen from schools and
youth theatre clubs performed new plays by
12 writers in 1999, under the guidance of the
RNT and the writers themselves, who
included Alan Ayckbourn. The National
Youth Theatre in London, the peripatetic
National Youth Theatre of Wales and the
Scottish Youth Theatre in Glasgow offer early
acting opportunities to the young. The ACE
supports several national touring companies
that produce plays for children, including
Pop-Up, Quicksilver and Theatre Centre.
Training
In December 1998 the DCMS and the
Department for Education and Employment
(DFEE) announced that £19 million a year
would replace the previous discretionary grants
for drama and dance students, thus alleviating
their problems in obtaining funds for tuition
and maintenance. From autumn 1999 over 800
students a year will be able to cover their tuition
fees on the same basis as other higher and
further education pupils. All training must be at
accredited institutions and towards recognised
qualifications, with annual evaluation by the

DCMS and DFEE to ensure that standards are
maintained. Among drama schools which train
actors, directors, technicians and stage managers
are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London x^cademy of Music and
Dramatic Art (LAMDA), and the Drama
Centre (all in London); the Bristol Old Vic
School, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama (Glasgow) and the Welsh College of
Music and Drama (Cardiff). Competition to
enter the School of Performing Arts at
Stratford-upon-Avon College is keen.
Pantomime
Pantomine, a quintessentially British art form,
originated in England in the harlequinade
afterpieces of early 18th-century plays. In
Victorian times its themes shifted to fairy tales,
with juggling and acrobatics, as wholesome
entertainment for children. After the mid-19th
century, performances became limited to an
extended Christmas season. By tradition a
young actress (or nowadays a pop singer) takes
the part of the hero (principal boy) and a comic
actor plays an old woman, or dame. Pantomimes
such as Cinderella, Aladdin and Dick
Whittington, with favourite singers, comedians,
and television and sporting personalities as
additional draws, play to packed houses which
hiss the villains and cheer the heroes.
MUSIC
In 1998 more than 200 million music albums
and 80 million singles were sold in the UK,
w hile turnover increased by over 5% on the
previous year. Gross overseas earnings by the
UK music industry were £1.3 billion, of
which more than half came from the sales of
recordings, and the net surplus on overseas
trade was over £500 million. The industry
employs about 130,500 people. In 1998-99 the
Government’s Music Industry Forum
addressed trade barriers and CD piracy, and
the provision of venues for live music.
Orchestral and Choral Music
During 1998-99 the London Symphony
Orchestra (LSO) took its Elgar series to New
York in January, before returning to London
and performances under Myung-Whun
Chung, Lorin Maazel and Bernard Haitink
(Barbican Centre) and at the Proms under
Colin Davis. The Philharmonia played
German Romantic music, as well as an Elgar
series. The London Philharmonic performed
under Haitink and under the young British
conductor Daniel Harding. The Royal
Philharmonic gave Brahms and Berg at the
Barbican, and the second half of a Mahler
cycle at the Royal Albert Hall. The City of
Birmingham Symphony toured Europe under
Simon Rattle, after his official farewell in 1998
as its principal conductor (954 concerts in 18
years). In Glasgow, the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra’s Discovery series
continued with works by Tippett and
Korndorf. At the Huddersfield Contemporary
Music Festival, helped by a £2.4 million EC
grant and directed by Richard Steinitz, 60
events (and works by 60 composers) took place
in 11 days. In June 1999 Truro inaugurated
the Cornish Sinfonia, to go with its recently
opened Hall for Cornwall.
The Bournemouth, Birmingham and
London Symphony Orchestras and the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic will see their ACE
awards rise by 10% or more during
1999-2000.
Anthony Payne’s completion of Elgar’s
Third Symphony won widespread praise, and
the vote of the critic of the Financial Times as
one of the six best recordings of the year—by
the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew
Davis. In March 1999 a festival in Helsinki
celebrated Thomas Ades (see p. 252). The
1999 Kathleen Ferrier prize (worth £10,000
and awarded to a young singer on the
threshold of a career, in memory of the great
English contralto—1912-53) was won by the
23-year-old soprano Sally Matthews.
Almost all the leading orchestras maintain
their own choral societies, which sing,
especially in oratorio, at the leading music
festivals. British performers also show their
expertise in this medium abroad, as at the
Halle Festival in Germany in 1999, in
Handel’s Samson. The English tradition of
ecclesiastical choral singing is exemplified by
choirs such as those of King’s College Chapel,
Cambridge, and Christ Church Cathedral,
255
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Oxford. The choir at Westminster Cathedral,
which went on a United States tour in 1998, is
known for its more astringent tone (based on
that of the Sistine Chapel at Rome). Male-
voice choirs are an essential part of the Welsh
tradition.
Two celebrated events in the musical
calendar are the Leeds International
Pianoforte Competition for young pianists and
the biennial Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition, which attracts outstanding
young singers from all countries.
Pop and Rock Music
In 1998-99 British pop groups and singers
continued to win praise for their creativity.
Some fuse traditional music, of increasing
significance in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, into their work. The Welsh
contribution is especially strong: Manic Street
Preachers won a 1998 Q^award for Best Band
in the World Today and a 1999 Brit award for
Best Group. Another Q_award went to
Catatonia for Best Single (‘Road Rage’); their
singer Cerys Matthews was called ‘the finest
set of Welsh tonsils since Tom Jones and she’s
not afraid to use them’. The Stereophonies
and Super Furry Animals, who regularly
record in Welsh, also reflect the vibrant Welsh
entertainment scene. The Q^award for Best
New Band went to the Merseyside band
Gomez, who also won the Technics Mercury
Music Prize for their debut album Bring It
On. Robbie Williams won three Brit awards
for Best British Solo Artist, and for his single
‘Angels’ and video Millennium. Des’Ree was
Best British Female Solo Artist. The
Eurythmics (Annie Lennox and Dave
Stewart) received the Brit award for
Outstanding Contribution to British Music. In
1998 the Spice Girls (who have sold over 9
million albums in the United States alone),
with ‘Goodbye’, became the second group
(after the Beatles) to top the Christmas singles
chart for three consecutive years. Black Star
Liner and Joi are the latest bands to emerge
from what is known as the British Asian
Underground, while Bradford rockers
Terrorvision, with their hit album Tequila,
fused funk, jazz and rap into their own brand
of heavy metal.
In a poll conducted for BBC Radio 2 in
1999 on the top 100 songs of the 20th
century, the number one song was the
Beatles’ Yesterday.
March 1999 saw the opening of the
National Centre for Popular Music in
Sheffield; £11 million of the total cost of £15
million was provided by a Lottery award. Its
four sections explain the genre’s context and
derivation, while computers, instruments,
mixing desks and edit suites encourage visitor
participation.
Jazz
The Brecon, Cheltenham, London Oris jazz
festivals, and Edinburgh International Jazz
and Blues Festival, and venues such as Ronnie
Scott’s in London’s Soho, have helped win
new audiences for jazz in the UK and showed
how it can evolve when exposed to other
musical influences, such as pop and Brazilian
rhythms. Claire Martin, described by a critic
as ‘the most accomplished jazz singer Britain
has produced in a long while’, explored pop
territory in her 1999 album Take My Heart,
while Nucleus, regarded as the most
influential jazz-rock fusion band in Britain,
made a Contemporary Music Network tour of
the UK. Julian Joseph, a leading young British
jazz pianist and composer, synthesises West
Indian and British folk influences, traditional
jazz and classical music, while the violinist
Nigel Kennedy has continued to mix the jazz
and classical genres.
Training
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatoires. The leading
London conservatoires are the Royal Academy
of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. Outside London are
the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow, the Royal
Northern College of Music in Manchester, the
Welsh College of Music and Drama in
Cardiff, and the Birmingham Conservatoire.

CULTURE
With the help of grants from the European
Regional Development Fund, Glasgow
Development Agency, the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts and £2.5 million from the
SAC’s Lottery Fund, the Alexander Gibson
Opera School opened at the RSAMD in
December 1998.
Other Educational Schemes
The National Foundation for Youth Music
(formerly Youth Music Trust), set up in 1999,
aims to improve opportunities for young
people to get involved in music-making, with
£10 million a year from ACE Lottery funds
and donations from other sources, including
British Phonographic Industry. In addition,
some £150 million from the DFEE’s
standards fund will be used over three years to
help buy musical instruments for schools,
restore free tuition and provide extra training
for teachers. The LSO won a £3.7 million
ACE Lottery award towards a £15 million
music education centre at St Luke’s, a disused
church in east London which is to be
transformed into recording studios, rehearsal
rooms and classrooms.
The national youth orchestras of Great
Britain, Scotland, Ulster and Wales, and other
youth orchestras have established high
standards. Nearly a third of the players in the
European Community Youth Orchestra come
from the UK. There is also a National Youth
Jazz Orchestra and a network of other youth
jazz orchestras and wind bands.
OPERA
London’s Royal Opera House at Covent
Garden is due to reopen in November 1999
after a £214 million restoration and
redevelopment, which includes the
reconstruction of E.M.Barry’s dome of 1858, 80
extra places and improved access for audiences
‘in the gods’. It plans to broaden the appeal of
opera and ballet. There will also be a studio
theatre for educational work and improved
access for the public, including free lunchtime
concerts and exhibitions in the foyer areas.
UK opera companies staged acclaimed
performances during 1998-99. Joan Rodgers
headed the cast, with the veteran soprano
Elizabeth Vaughan, in the 1999 English
National Opera (ENO) production of
Poulenc’s The Carmelites, conducted by her
husband, Paul Daniel. Another ENO triumph
in 1999 was Robert Carsen’s staging of
Handel’s Semele, for which the soprano
Rosemary Joshua, the mezzos Sarah Connolly
and Susan Bickley, and the tenor John Mark
Ainsley received rapturous reviews.
Sadlers Wells in London, rebuilt and
reopening to record audiences and box office
receipts, received £4.2 million of ACE Lottery
funding to help complete the theatre. It was
host to a revival of Britten’s ‘American’ opera
Paul Banyan (1941). Among Welsh National
Opera successes at home and on tour were
Janacek’s^cwM/a and Britten’s Peter Grimes
(the latter with Janice Watson and John
Daszak under Carlo Rizzi). Critics had high
praise for Opera North’s autumn 1998
production of Verdi’s Don Carlos, singling out
Julian Gavin in the title role, Alastair Miles as
Philip and the US soprano Lori Phillips as
Elisabeth. Among Scottish Opera’s
achievements in 1999 were Donald McVicar’s
staging of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier (under
Richard Armstrong), and a revival of James
MacMillan’s Ines de Castro, with the admired
contralto Anne Collins in the cast.
DANCE
The Royal Ballet, with an unrivalled
repertory, has been called one of the greatest
artistic achievements in Britain in the 20th
century, has produced masterpieces by some
of the world’s finest creators and has nurtured
dancers of international fame. In April and
May 1999 it toured the Far East, visiting
Japan and China; in July, at Sadlers Wells it
performed new work by William Tuckett and
revived Frederick Ashton’s Ondine.
Birmingham Royal Ballet, at Sadlers Wells in
February, gave David Bintley’s Edward //and
revived Ninette de Valois’ The Prospect before
Us (to the music of Boyce arranged by
Constant Lambert). English National Ballet
was at the Coliseum at Christmas and at the
Royal Albert Hall for a summer season (with
Swan Lake). Scottish Ballet toured Scotland
in spring 1999 with La Sylphide and a modern
triple bill (three short pieces in one
257
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
performance). Northern Ballet Theatre staged
a new Carmen in Leeds in February, while the
Rambert Dance Company visited Austria and
Italy in the spring and did a Sadlers Wells
season in May, including new work by the US
choreographer Twyla Tharp.
London’s annual festival, Dance Umbrella,
a showcase for the most innovative in present-
day world choreography, celebrated its 20th
anniversary in September 1998. British
performers included Michael Clark and the
Siobhan Davies Dance Company. Her first
full-length work for nearly 30 years, Wild Air,
had its premiere in Oxford in May 1999.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by specialist
schools, which include the Royal Ballet School,
the Central School of Ballet, the Northern
School of Contemporary Dance (Leeds) and
the London Contemporary Dance School.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Phoenix Dance Company and
English National Ballet, for example, have
won awards for their projects. Ludus Dance
Company, in Lancaster, works mainly with
young people. The National Youth Dance
Company gives a chance tor young people to
work with professionals.
FILMS
Across the European Union (EU) there are
some 54 aid schemes which distribute about
£470 million a year to the audio-visual
industries: France provides 39% of this figure,
Germany 20% and the UK and Italy both
6%. Films made in the UK, with British
makers, actors and technicians, excited intense
interest in 1998—99, but the UK audience for
British films declined from 23% of the total
UK box office receipts in 1997 to 14% in
1998. Total investment in feature films
production in the UK fell by 15% to £578
million, compared with a peak of £676 million
in 1997. The number of US productions shot
in Britain costing more than £10 million fell
from six to four, and their combined budgets
from £233 million to £139 million. During
1996_99 US film-makers have contributed
54% of the money spent making films in the
UK, for example the highly acclaimed Saving
Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love.
However, order books for the main UK
studios were fuller in 1999 than in the
productive 1950s and Britain is ahead in the
digital technologies of film-making, which
gives it importance as a centre in the final
stages of production. Furthermore, the
turnover of its rapidly expanding computer¬
generated special effects industry was more
than £31 million in 1998.
Among government initiatives in 1998-99
to boost the UK film industry were:
• Film Export UK, an industry body to
help exports of British films worldwide;
• Film Finance Forum, to generate more
British and European investment in film
and to improve links between the City of
London (see p. 506) and the industry;
• establishment of a British Film Office in
Los Angeles to provide a focus for
contact between the UK and US
industries;
• reforming the rules under which British
films can qualify for tax and other
benefits, thus helping to attract increased
investment; and
• establishment of a Film Education
Working Group, under the auspices of
the British Film Institute, to draw up a
strategy for creating a more ‘cineliterate’
population.
The Government also proposes to set up, by
April 2000, the Film Council, a body to
develop film culture and the film industry,
and to be the Lottery distributor—of at least
£27 million a year—to the industry.
In 1998, approximately 96 films were shot
in the UK by British or foreign companies or
by British companies shooting abroad. Of
these 78 were wholly or partly produced by
British companies. Total box office takings in
1998 topped £332 million, with total
admissions of 135.2 million, a decrease of
nearly 3% on 1997.
Government support for the film industry
allows a 100% tax write-off on the production

CULTURE
The Full Monty (1997) and Four Weddings
and a Funeral (1994), which cost £1.6
million and £2 million to make, are the
highest-earning British films of all time,
earning £161 million and £155 million
worldwide respectively. In third place is
Bean: the Ultimate Disaster Movie (XWl',
£146 million), followed by Trainspotting
(1996; £44 million) and Sliding Doors (1998;
£42 million). In March 1999 the main
British Academy Award success was
Shakespeare in Love (US-financed but made
in Britain, mostly with British talent),
winning the award for Best Picture, and
awards for Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actress),
Judi Dench (Best Supporting Actress),
Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard (Best
Screenplay), Martin Childs and Jill Quertier
(Best Art Direction), Stephen Warbeck
(Best Musical Score) and Sandy Powell
(Best Costume). The British film Elizabeth
won an Academy Award for Jenny Shircore
(Best Make-up), who gained the BAFTA
award as well. The BAFTA Best Actress
was Australian Cate Blanchett in Elizabeth.
Shakespeare in Love also won the BAFTA
awards for Best Film, Best Supporting
Actress (Judi Dench) and Best Supporting
Actor for Australian Geoffrey Rush. The
Alexander Korda award for Outstanding
British Film went to Elizabeth.
Among the many other international
awards to British talent were two for Kate
Winslet (People’s Choice European Actress
of the Year—from the European Film
Academy in Berlin—#nd Empire magazine
award for Best Actress in Titanic). Among
the London Evening Standard awards were
Michael Caine and director Ken Loach
(Special Achievement), Julie Christie (Best
Scxxtss—Afterglow), Derek Jacobi (Best
Actor—Love is the Devil), and Eileen
Atkins (Best Screenplay—Afw Dalloway)',
Best Film was John Boorman’s The General
and Most Promising Newcomer Guy
Ritchie, director of Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels, which also won an Orange
Audience Award. Two British films by
first-time directors won plaudits at the
Cannes film festival in May 1999: Damien
O’Donnell’s East is East and Lynne
Ramsay’s Ratcatcher.
and acquisition costs for British movies with
budgets of up to £15 million.
Animation
The BAFTA award in 1999 for Best Short
Animated Film went to the BBC’s The
Canterbury Tales, a collaboration by seven
directors from England, Wales and Russia. A
total of £1.37 million in National Lottery film
production awards has been made since 1995
to animated film (£517,000 in 1998). In
addition, the ACE contributes £50,000 a year
to a scheme for experimental animation, in
conjunction with Channel 4. Midnight Dance,
a Nerve Centre production from Northern
Ireland, won Best Animation award at the
1998 International Short Film Festival at Palm
Springs in the United States.
Government Support
The Government supports a number of
organisations which promote the film
industry. The largest public source of finance
is the ACE’s Lottery Film Programme. Since
1995 the ACE has awarded £67 million to 79
feature films. A further £1.4 million in awards
has helped production of 49 short films. The
Government’s largest grants go to the bfi (see
p. 260), to Scottish Screen, which promotes
film-making in Scotland, and to the Northern
Ireland Film Commission (NIFC), which has a
similar remit in the Province.
The British Film Commission (BFC) markets
the UK film and television production service
industry to overseas producers, to attract
inward investment. The BFC works alongside
the UK Film Commission Network, which
comprises 24 area or city offices.
British Screen Finance (BSF), a private
sector company, provides loans to enable
feature films involving new British talent to be
produced. It also helps finance short films and
the cost of developing screenplays and setting
up film projects. Total commitment since
1986 is £48.8 million. Among successful
recent films supported by BSF are Hilary and
Jackie and Beautiful People.
259
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The European Co-Production Fund, a UK
initiative, offers loans of up to 30% of a film’s
budget, enabling British producers to
collaborate in the making of films with other
European producers. It has committed £16
million to about 50 feature movies, with a total
value of some £140 million. Recent award¬
winning pictures made with help from the
Fund include Ma Vie en Rose (Golden Globe
award for Best Foreign Film in 1998) and On
Connait la Chanson (winner of seven Cesar
awards).
British Film Institute (bfi)
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the bfi, and by
Scottish Screen and the NIFC.
The bfi maintains the National Film and
Television Archive, which contains over
350,000 titles dating from 1894, together with
extensive collections of stills, posters and
designs. The bfi National Library forms the
world’s largest collection of film-related
books, periodicals, scripts and other written
materials.
On the South Bank bfi activities include
running the National Film Theatre, which
screens over 2,000 films and television
programmes each year, and the bfi London
IMAX, Britain’s largest screen. The bfi also
runs the annual London Film Festival, now in
its 43rd year, and supports newer festivals in
the UK.
A network of independent cinemas across
the UK also receives bfi support. Its
educational activities include courses,
conferences and other events, and helping to
formulate national film education policy.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols 50-60 full-time students a year and
about 850 on short course programmes. The
London International Film School, the Royal
College of Art, and some universities and
other institutions of higher education, also
offer courses in production. In May 1999 the
Government announced a Skills Investment
Fund, worth £1.5 million, to boost UK film
production training.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Public cinemas must be licensed by local
authorities, which have a legal duty to prohibit
the admission of children to unsuitable films,
and may prevent the showing of any picture.
In assessing films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent non-
statutory body, the British Board of Film
Classification (BBFC), to which all items must
be submitted. It does not use any written code
of censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare occasions,
it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the BBFC are put into one
of the following categories:
• U (universal), suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted, for example, licensed cinema
clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
designation.
MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES
Some 81 million visits were made in 1998-99
to the UK’s 2,500 or so museums and galleries
open to the public, which include the major
national collections, about 1,000 independent
museums, and 800 receiving support from

CULTURE
local authorities. About a third of international
visitors come to the UK because of its
museums. Some 40,000 staff are employed in
this sector. Among government initiatives in
1999 to ensure that the country’s ‘hidden
treasures’ are opened up to as wide an
audience as possible are:
• 24-Hour Museum, on the Internet
(www.24hourmuseum.org.uk), which
provides a gazetteer of all UK museums
and galleries, a magazine, search facilities
and educational resources;
• Museums for the Many, a set of
standards to encourage all major
museums and galleries to offer the widest
possible access to their collections; and
• a £15 million challenge fund to increase
access to collections held by 43
‘designated museums’ or museum
services in England, such as Harewood
House in Yorkshire.
Museums and galleries in the UK receive
about £500 million a year in public
expenditure. National museums are financed
chiefly from government funds; some charge
for entry to their permanent collections and
special exhibitions, although the Government
wishes admission charges to be phased out (see
p. 248); from spring 1999, all children have
been allowed free access to those sponsored by
the DCMS. All national museums in England
and Scotland are managed by independent
trustees.
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities and independent or
privately funded bodies may receive help in
building up their collections through grants
administered by the Museums & Galleries
Commission (MGC) and the Area Museum
Councils throughout the UK. Support to
national and regional public and independent
museums and galleries is also given by the
Arts Councils and by trusts, voluntary bodies,
the Heritage Lottery Fund and the National
Art Collections Fund.
Much of the MGC’s work is in helping
museums maintain, preserve and develop their
collections. It also provides funds to the seven
English Area Museum Councils, which supply
services and their own small grants to
individual museums, and to the Cultural
Heritage National Training Organisation and
the Museum Documentation Association.
The MGC advises the Secretary of State on
the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, whereby pre¬
eminent works of art may be accepted by the
Government in settlement of tax and allocated
to public galleries. Items accepted in 1998-99
include: a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Millais
(Tate Gallery) and the Sherborne Missal
(British Library).
By April 1999 UK museums were
estimated to have benefited from £529 million
of National Lottery money. In addition to £24
million to the National Museums & Galleries
on Merseyside and £15 million to the Victoria
and Albert (V&A) Museum, in 1998-99
£18.75 million was allocated to the Tate
Gallery of British Art on Millbank, due for
completion in 2000, and £3.75 million for an
extension to London’s Geffrye Museum,
which illustrates the domestic lives of ordinary
people.
Among noted exhibitions in 1998-99 the
Tate at Liverpool presented the only
European showing of works (mostly 1930s) by
Salvador Dali, and at St Ives ‘Partnerships
and Practice’ focused on schools and artists
associated with west Cornwall from the 1930s
to the 1960s. In London, Patrick Caulfield,
regarded as one of the best painters to emerge
from the British Pop-Art movement, had a
retrospective at the Hayward; the National
Portrait Gallery mounted ‘British Sporting
Heroes’; the Design Museum opened
‘Modern Britain’, which tracked the influence
of Art Deco in British design; and the Canon
Photography Gallery at the V&A presented a
photographic record, ‘Studies from Life,
1857-64 by Clementina Lady Hawarden’.
In November 1998 the Museum and Art
Gallery at Birmingham celebrated the native
symbolist painter Edward Burne-Jones. In
spring 1999 the ‘Glasgow 1999’ project
‘Vertigo’ looked at ten major architectural
schemes around the world, while Edinburgh
drew praise for ‘The Draughtsman’s Art’,
master drawings from the National Gallery of
Scotland, and ‘O Caledonia!’, which focused
on Scotland’s Romantic past as fostered by
Walter Scott.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Two events in London in early 1999 were
devoted to French painters. The Royal
Academy’s ‘Monet in the 20th century’
sold 100,000 advance tickets, saw an
average 8,470 visitors a day, took a total of
£3.9 million at the box office, and stayed
open for 24 hours to give art lovers a last
chance to catch it. The National Gallery’s
‘Portraits by Ingres: image of an epoch’,
the largest show (40 portraits and 50
portrait drawings) ever devoted to this
artist, saw long queues for admission.
The beginning of the world’s first great
work of literature, the 4,000-year-old
Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, was
rediscovered in 1998 on clay tablets in a
storeroom of the British Museum (BM). It
is only one of dozens of archaeological
treasures which resurface every year inside
the BM. Only 1% of the objects are on
view; the rest, kept in store, constitute the
world’s largest archaeological research
collection.
The Dean Gallery of 20th-century Art,
opened in Edinburgh in 1999, contains the
UK’s most significant modern collection
after the Tate Gallery and is its most
important centre for the study of Dada and
Surrealism.
redisplayed its impressive collection of arms
and armour, including the suits of armour
made for Henry VIII, Charles I and James II.
At a cost of £33 million, the Great Court of
the British Museum, unseen for 150 years, has
been restored to its original 2-acre expanse.
The Turner Prize (worth £20,000),
awarded annually at the Tate Gallery to a
British artist under 50 years of age for an
outstanding exhibition or other presentation of
their work, was won in 1998 by the painter
Chris Ofili (for ‘the originality and energy of
his painting and his dynamic use of colour’).
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries
contain some of the world’s most
comprehensive exhibits of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and
general interest. The English national
museums are:
• the British Museum;
• the Natural History Museum;
• the V&A (fine and decorative arts);
• the National Museum of Science &
Industry, including the Science Museum
and its two regional institutes, the
National Railway Museum (York) and

London (British painting and modern
art), Liverpool and St Ives (St Ives
School and modern art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum, which has
three sites in London and one at Duxford
(which includes the American Air
Museum) in Cambridgeshire;
• the Royal Armouries, Britain’s oldest

• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (paintings,

Merseyside.
In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Scottish Museum, the
Museum of Scotland, the Scottish United
Services Museum and the Scottish
Agricultural Museum, in Edinburgh; the
Museum of Flight, near North Berwick; and
the Museum of Costume at Shambellie House
near Dumfries. The arrangements of the new
Museum of Scotland, built at a cost of £52
million and devoted to Scottish history, have
been praised by a critic for their ‘unabashed
Scottishness’ and imagination.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and
the Dean Gallery of 20th-century Art (see
p. 262). The National Galleries also have
deposits at Paxton House near Berwick and
Duff House in Banff. In 1998-99 the National
Museums of Scotland attracted 632,400
visitors, and the National Galleries of
Scotland 842,000.
The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff
has a number of branches, including the
xMuseum of Welsh Life at St Fagans, the Slate
Museum at Llanberis and the Industrial and
Maritime Museum in the Cardiff Bay
development. The Centre for Visual Arts in
Cardiff (with galleries for permanent and
temporary exhibitions), which has benefited
from a £7.5 million Lottery award, opened in
1999.
Northern Ireland’s three major museums—
the Ulster Museum in Belfast, the Ulster Folk
and Transport Museum in County Down, and
the Ulster-American Folk Park in County
Ty rone—merged in 1998 to form the National
Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Museum of London (whose
‘London Bodies’ exhibition in 1998 shed light
on the medical condition of Londoners of the
past); the Courtauld Institute Galleries
(masterpieces of 14th-20th-century European
painting); and the London Transport
Museum.
Museums outside London include the Shoe
Museum at Street in Somerset, which shows
footwear since Roman times, and museums
associated with universities, such as the
Ashmolean in Oxford, the Fitzwilliam at
Cambridge and the Hunterian in Glasgow.
Newly opened to the public is the Henry
Moore open-air museum of sculpture at Perry
Green in Hertfordshire.
The Government has indicated that owners
of works of art who do not have to pay
inheritance tax (see p. 409) because they have
promised public access will have to advertise
their opening hours nationally.
Among a number of national art exhibiting
institutions is the Royal Academy of Arts, at
Burlington House in London, which holds an
annual Summer Exhibition and other
important ones during the year. The Summer
Exhibition is the world’s largest open present-
day art display and combines work by
established artists and by others showing for
263
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the first time. The Royal Scottish Academy
holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There
are also children’s shows, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Open-air museums depict the life of an area
or preserve early industrial remains, such as
the Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in
Shropshire and the North of England Open
Air Museum at Beamish in County Durham.
Skills of the past are revived in a number of
‘living’ museums, such as the Gladstone
Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-Trent and the
Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmith’s College of Art, London), which
have absorbed the former independent art
schools, and in further education colleges and
private art schools. Some of these institutions
award degrees at postgraduate level. The
Royal College of Art in London is the only
postgraduate school of art and design in the
world. Art is also taught at an advanced level
at the four Scottish Art Schools.
University courses concentrate largely on
academic disciplines, such as the history of art.
The Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College London are leading institutions. Art is a
foundation subject in the National Curriculum
(see p. 136). The Society for Education through
Art, among other activities, encourages schools
to buy original works by organising an annual
Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The UK’s first big prize, awarded by the
Jerwood Foundation, to help young designers
to establish themselves in the fashion industry,
and worth £ 125,000 in cash and other
benefits, was won in 1999 by Shelley Fox.
Export Control of Works of Art
The UK market is second only to that of the
United States. The UK sales industry directly
employs 40,000 and has an annual turnover of
.£2.2 billion (about 50% of the EU market).
Auctions of works of art take place in the main
auction houses (two of the longest established
being Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through
private dealers.
A licence is required before certain items
can be exported, and if a DCMS Expert
Adviser objects to the granting of a licence,
the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If
the Committee considers a work to be of
national importance, it can recommend to the
Government that a decision be deferred on the
licence application for a specified time to give
a chance for an offer to be made to buy it at or
above the recommended fair market price.
The UK opposes an EU proposal to impose
artists’ resale rights, w hereby the price of any
work of art sold during an artist’s lifetime, or
for 70 years after his or her death, would
include a tax payable to the artist or heirs. The
Government is working with its EU partners
to devise a solution which would not increase
the cost of selling in London and drive dealers
and collectors elsewhere.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
Over 200 literary prizes are awarded yearly in
the UK, ranging in value from £30 to
£30,000, and for many different categories of
work. The winner of the 1998 Booker Prize
for Fiction (worth £20,000; UK and
Commonwealth citizens eligible) was the
British writer Ian McEwan, for Amsterdam,
while the Whitbread awards (valued at £2,000
each with £21,000 extra for Book of the Year;
for British subjects), announced in January
1999, were distributed as follows:
• Book of the Year and Poetry award: the
late Ted Hughes, who died in 1998,
Birthday Letters',
• Novel award: Justin Cartwright, Leading
the Cheers',
• First Novel award: Giles Foden, The Last
King of Scotland',
• Biography award: Amanda Foreman,
Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire', and
• Children’s Book of the Year (£10,000):
David Almond, Skellig.
CULTURE
Birthday Letters also won Ted Hughes the
1998 T.S. Eliot award (worth £5,000) and
Amsterdam won Ian McEwan the 1999
Hamburg Shakespeare prize, worth £15,000.
William Trevor won the fourth David Cohen
British Literature Prize, worth £30,000. The
world’s largest fiction prize (£100,000), the
International Impac Dublin literary award,
went for the first time to a British novelist,
Andrew Miller, for Ingenious Pain.
In 1999 Andrew Motion succeeded Ted
Hughes as Poet Laureate, who receives a
stipend as an officer of the Royal Household
and whose role is, for the first time, limited to
ten years.1
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary works (including computer
programs and databases), and dramatic,
musical or artistic works, films, sound
recordings, cable programmes and broadcasts,
are automatically protected by copyright in
the UK. This protection is also given to works
from EU member states, or from countries
party to international copyright conventions,
the World Trade Organisation or reciprocal
agreements. The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting, rental and lending,
and issue to the public of his or her work; and
against dealing in unauthorised copies. In
most cases the author is the first owner of the
copyright, and the term of copyright in
literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works is
generally the life of the author and a period of
70 years from the end of the year in which he
or she dies. For films the term is 70 years from
the end of the calendar year in which the death
occurs of the last to die of the following:
principal director, authors of the screenplay
and dialogue, or composer of music for the
film. Sound recordings are protected for 50
years from the end of the year of making or
release, and broadcasts for 50 years from the
end of the year of broadcast.
Performers are also given automatic
protection against unauthorised

copies of a recording. This lasts for 50 years
from the year of performance or release of a
recording of it. They also have a right to
equitable remuneration for the playing in
public, or inclusion in a broadcast or cable
programme service, of a commercially
published sound recording of their
performance. A right against the extraction
and re-utilisation of the contents of a database
(‘database rights’) was introduced from
January 1998, where there has been substantial
investment in obtaining, verifying or
presenting the contents of the database.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association, the Royal Society of
Literature and the Welsh Academy (Yr
Academi Gymreig). The leading society for
studies in the humanities is the British
Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the
British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several devoted to particular
authors, such as Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. The Poetry Society sponsors poetry
readings and recitals. London’s South Bank
Centre runs a programme of literary events.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service. There are almost
5,000 public libraries in the UK. In Great
Britain over 60% of adults are members of their
local library and about half of these borrow at
least once a month. About 483 million books
and 37 million audio-visual items were
borrowed from UK public libraries in 1997-98.
Adult fiction accounted for 51%, adult non¬
fiction for 25% and children’s books for 23%.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
265
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and all provide services for children,
while reference and information sections, and
art, music, commercial and technical
departments, meet a growing demand. The
information role is important for all libraries:
online public access catalogues, library
management systems, personal computers for
public use, Internet access, CD-ROMs and
reference databases figure prominently. A
government initiative under the New
Opportunities Fund of the Lottery (see
p. 121) is providing £20 million for
information and communications technology
training of library staff and £50 million for
enabling library material to be stored and
accessed in digitised form.
The Government is advised (until April
2000—see p. 248) by the Library and
Information Commission, a forum for policy
on library and information provision in
general. It is committed to networking all
public libraries and connecting them to the
National Grid for Learning by 2002.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors royalties from a central
fund (totalling £5 million in 1998-99) for the
loans made of their books from public libraries
in the UK. Payment is made according to the
number of times an author’s books are lent
out. The maximum yearly payment an author
can receive is £6,000.
In 1997-98 the most borrowed popular
author from UK public libraries was
Catherine Cookson, with 12 out of the top 20
fiction titles; the most borrowed children’s
author was R.L. Stine, with 15 out of the top
20 children’s titles.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information management.
Founded in 1877, the Association has some
25,000 members. It maintains a Register of
Chartered Members and is the designated
In 1900 the deaths occurred of John
Ruskin, R.D. Blackmore (Lorna Doone)
and Oscar Wilde, and Joseph Conrad’s

Samuel Butler (Ereivhon) died, as did G.A.
Henty, prolific writer of adventure books
for boys. The same year saw the
publication of Rudyard Kipling’s
collection of poems The Five Nations
(including ‘White Man’s Burden’ and
‘Recessional’; his novel Kim appeared in
1901), Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit, Conan
Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes thriller The
Hound of the Baskervilles and Arnold
Bennett’s Anna of the Five Towns.

The British Library and National
Libraries
The British Library (BL), the national library
of the UK, is custodian of the most important
266
CULTURE
research collection in the world. It is also the
largest UK publicly funded building
constructed in the 20th century. The total
floor space is approximately 100,000 sq
metres. The basements, the deepest in
London, have 300 km of shelving for 12
million books. There are 11 reading areas,
three exhibition galleries and a conference
centre with a 255-seat auditorium. British
publishers are legally obliged to deposit a copy
of their publications at the BL. The National
Libraries of Scotland and Wales, the Bodleian
at Oxford and the Cambridge University
Library (and the Library of Trinity College,
Dublin) can also claim copies of all new
British publications under legal deposit.
Treasures on display in the BL’s John
Ritblat Gallery include the Lindisfarne Gospels
(c. 700), Magna Carta (1215) and
Shakespeare’s First Folio (1623), together
with musical, historical and literary pieces in
the handwriting of Handel, Nelson and Jane
Austen, and many others. Some 475,000
reader visits are made to the BL each year.
The reading rooms are open to those who
need to see material (for example,
manuscripts, newspapers, journals, stamps
and maps, as well as books) not readily
available elsewhere or whose work or studies
require the facilities of the national library.
The BL’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within the UK
and between the UK and other countries. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a vear.
Other Libraries
As well as public and national libraries there
are nearly 700 libraries in higher and further
education, about 5,600 in schools and 2,220
specialised libraries within other public and
private sector organisations (such as
commercial companies, research councils and
government departments).
The university book collections of Oxford
and Cambridge, with over 7 million and more
than 6 million items held by their respective
university libraries, are unmatched by those of
other foundations. However, the combined
stores of the colleges and institutions of the
University of London total 9 million volumes,
the John Rylands University Library of
Manchester contains 3.5 million volumes,
Edinburgh 2.5 million, Leeds 2.3 million, and
Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen
each have over 1 million volumes. Many
universities have vital research collections in
special subjects—the Barnes Medical Library
at Birmingham and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the London
School of Economics, for example.
Besides a number of private collections, such
as that of the London Library (for private
subscribers), there are the collections of such
learned societies as the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, the Royal Geographical
Society and the Royal Academy of Music. The
Poetry Library in the South Bank Centre,
owned by the ACE, is a collection of 20th-
century poetry written in or translated into
English; it has about 60,000 volumes.
The Public Record Office (PRO) in
London and in Kew (Surrey) houses the
records of the superior courts of law of
England and W ales and of most government
departments, as well as millions of historical
documents, such as Domesday Book (1086) and
autograph letters and documents of the
sovereigns of England. Public records, with a
few exceptions, are available for inspection by
everyone 30 years after the end of the year in
which they were created. The Scottish Record
Office in Edinburgh and the PRO of Northern
Ireland in Belfast serve the same purpose.
Books
In 1998 British publishers issued over 104,600
separate titles (including new editions). The
UK book industry exported books worth over
;£L1 billion in 1998, 30% up on 1997. A
recent trend has been the success of narrative
non-fiction, tracing an arcane or scientific
subject through history. London’s first
international festival of literature took place in
March 1999. In May 1999 the illustrator
Quentin Blake was appointed first Children’s
Laureate (a roving ambassador of books for
the young—with a prize of £10,000). A
children’s author named (by The Times) one of
the top five bedtime favourites for grown-ups
in 1999 was J.K. Rowling, for her Harry
Potter books.
267
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Among the leading trade organisations are
the Publishers Association (PA), which has
200 members; and the Booksellers Association,
with about 3,300 members. The PA, through
its International Division, promotes the export
of British books. The Welsh Book Council
and the Gaelic Books Council support the
publication of books in Welsh and in Gaelic.
The Book Trust encourages reading and the
promotion of books through an information
service and a children’s library.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical papers
outside the public records. It also advises
private owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government
on the acquisition and maintenance of
manuscripts. The Commission maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available to
researchers.
CRAFTS
The crafts in the UK have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid
amounted to £3.2 million in 1998—99. Policy
and funding for the crafts in England are, since
April 1999, the responsibility of the ACE,
which is required to allocate at least £3.4
million, £3.6 million and £3.8 million for crafts
for the years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02
respectively, with a further £750,000 for
development. The Crafts Council runs the
National Centre for Crafts in London,
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair (which
generated sales of £2.1 million for the trade in
1998), and co-ordinates British groups at
international fairs. Five Crafts Council
exhibitions took place at its London gallery in
1998 and 201,000 people visited these shows in
London and on tour. Craft Forum Wales has a
membership of 600 craft business groups in
Wales; they had a turnover of over £30 million
in 1998. Craftworks, an independent company,
is the development agency for Northern
Ireland. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland
also funds crafts promotion, while the SAC has
a Crafts Department, which promotes crafts
and helps craftworkers in Scotland.

The United Kingdom is at the forefront of the digital broadcasting age. New
digital terrestrial and satellite television services have been launched since late
1998 and cable and commercial digital radio services are getting under way
during 1999. Newspapers throughout the UK—despite a gradual decline in
hard-copy circulations for some national titles—continue to serve a wide
readership. The Internet is providing, increasingly, an additional medium for
information, entertainment and communication.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in the UK, while traditionally
viewed as a public service accountable to the
people, also embraces the principles of
competition and choice. Three public
authorities have the main responsibility for
television and radio services. They work to
broad requirements and objectives defined or
endorsed by Parliament, but are otherwise
independent in their day-to-day conduct of
business. The authorities are:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and
regulates commercial television services
including cable, satellite and independent
teletext services; and
• the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for government policy
towards broadcasting.
On average, people in the UK spend over
25 hours a week watching the television.
There are five established terrestrial analogue
channels, offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, and documentaries. These
comprise two national BBC networks,
financed almost wholly by a licence fee, and
the commercial ITV (Channel 3), Channel 4
and Channel 5 services, which are funded by
advertising and sponsorship. In Wales, S4C—
Sianel Pedwar Cymru—broadcasts
programmes on the fourth channel.
269
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Satellite television and cable services are
mainly funded by subscription income. The
largest satellite programmer is BSkyB (British
Sky Broadcasting—see also p. 278) which,
with around 7 million subscribers, dominates
subscription-based television in the UK.
The UK’s first digital satellite and
terrestrial television services1 were launched in
autumn 1998, providing the existing analogue
programmes in a digital format, together with
free-to-air and subscription and pay-per-view
services. Digital cable services are beginning
from 1999.

The BBC has five national radio networks,
which together transmit all types of music,
news, current affairs, drama, education, sport
and a range of features programmes. There are
also 39 BBC local radio stations serving
England and the Channel Islands, and national
radio services in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, including Welsh and Gaelic
language stations. BBC radio services
currently attract about 50% of listeners.
1 Digital broadcasting is a new, more effective way of
transmitting television (and radio) services. It allows much
more information than before to be transmitted, and can
offer many more channels, extra services, interactivity, and
higher quality picture and sound to viewers and listeners
willing to invest in new receiving equipment.
There are three national commercial radio
stations. About 225 independent local radio
(ILR) services are also in operation (a record
number of 23 new licences having been
awarded in 1998). Stations supply local news
and information, sport, music and other
entertainment, education and consumer advice.
A considerable expansion of local and
national radio will be made possible by digital
audio broadcasting. BBC digital radio
broadcasts began in 1995. The first
commercial digital radio services are starting
in 1999.
The UK television industry has a
worldwide reputation for innovation and
quality programmes. In 1997 British
television exports were worth some £470
million. However, the UK runs a
significant balance of trade deficit in
television owing to the increasing number
of imported television programmes on UK
cable and satellite channels. In April 1999,
following the publication of an
independent research report, the
Government announced an inquiry into
the television programming market to see
how UK television exports can be
improved and their value increased.
CHANGES IN REGULATION
Broadcasting in the UK is undergoing radical
change. The availability of more radio
frequencies, together with satellite, cable and
microwave transmissions, has already made a
greater number of local, national and
international services possible. The transition
from analogue to digital transmission
technology has* the potential to expand this
capacity enormously.
Legislation
In recognition of this potential, legislation was
passed in 1996 setting out a flexible regulatory
framework for the introduction of digital
terrestrial broadcasting and paving the way for
more broadly based competitive media groups.
There were four key governmental objectives:
270
THE MEDIA
• to safeguard plurality of media ownership
and diversity of viewpoint;
• to preserve the UK’s tradition of public
service broadcasting;
• to support the competitiveness of the
British broadcasting industry and give
the UK the opportunity to lead the world
in exploiting digital technology; and
• to ensure broadcasters maintain
appropriate standards of impartiality,
taste and decency.
Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting
The 1996 Broadcasting Act provided for:
• the licensing of up to 36 national digital
terrestrial television channels,
transmitted on six frequency channels or
‘multiplexes’,2 and serving, in the
medium term, from 70% to over 90% of
the population; and
• the licensing of at least 12 digital radio
services on two national multiplexes,
with at least one multiplex available for
local services in most areas of the UK,
and an additional multiplex for extra
local services in areas of greatest demand.
The legislation guaranteed capacity on
three of the six digital television multiplexes
and on one national radio multiplex for the
existing public service broadcasters. It also
stipulated that the ITC and Radio Authority
award national multiplex licences3 to those
2 Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals of
several broadcasters are combined into a single stream on
a single-frequency channel. There is therefore no longer a
direct one-to-one relationship between a television service
and a frequency.
3 The multiplex, or carriage and delivery system, is licensed
separately from the programme and additional services
which are carried on the multiplexes. Licences to operate
commercial digital terrestrial television (DTT) multiplexes
were awarded by the ITC in 1997, and all DTT multiplexes
started broadcasting in November 1998. The Radio
Authority awarded the national commercial radio multiplex
licence in October 1998 (with services expected to begin in
October 1999) and has started advertising local
commercial multiplex licences to provide local digital
services to most of the main population centres across the
UK over the next two to three years.
applicants whose plans best promote the
development of digital broadcasting—by
installing the new transmission network as
quickly as possible, making consumer receiver
equipment as affordable as possible,4 and
broadening consumer choice of programming.
Many of the new services on digital
television will be available on a subscription or
pay-per-view basis. Any broadcaster wishing
to offer pay-television needs to use a
‘conditional access’ system (covering
encryption, scrambling and subscription
management services) to ensure that only
those who have paid for a particular service
receive it. Since any dominant provider of
such systems would have the power to
determine who can, or cannot, enter the pay-
television market, it is important that
providers are subject to effective regulation.
The Government has implemented European
Union regulations to ensure that all
broadcasters can gain access on ‘fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms’ to
any digital set-top boxes which can receive
their signal. OFTEL (see p. 378), in
consultation with the ITC, has powers to
intervene over anti-competitive behaviour.
Media Ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling the
ITC and Radio Authority to keep ownership of
the broadcasting media widely spread and to
prevent undue concentrations of single and
cross-media ownership, in the wider public
interest. The 1996 Broadcasting Act relaxed
those rules, both within and across different
media sectors, to reflect the needs and
aspirations of the industry against the
background of accelerating technological change:
• allowing for greater cross-ownership
between newspaper groups, television
companies and radio stations, at both
national and regional levels; and
4 Digital television services can be received through an
existing television aerial, a cable connection or a satellite
dish. However, viewers who choose to receive digital
television by any of these methods need a special set-top
box decoder which enables digital television pictures to be
reassembled on screen. In time, television sets with a built-
in decoder will increasingly be available. Radio listeners
also need to invest in new sets to hear digital radio.
271
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• introducing ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can
assess and approve (or disallow) mergers
or acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The 1996 Act overturned the rule that no
one company could own more than two of the
ITV (Channel 3) licences; instead, a new limit
was set whereby no company could control
franchises covering more than 15% of the total
television audience. Local newspapers with
more than a 50% share of their market may
own a local radio station, providing at least
one other independent local radio station is
operating in that area.
In January 1999 the Government
announced its intention to relax restrictions on
digital radio ownership to encourage greater
investment.
Recent Developments
Existing analogue transmissions will continue
for some time, but the Government wants to
announce a switch-off date for analogue
services as soon as is practicable. In 1998, it
published a consultation paper on the
transition from analogue to digital
broadcasting, and in September 1999 said that
the switchover could start to happen as early
as 2006 and be completed by 2010.
The Government has also reviewed the
future regulation of broadcasting and
telecommunications, taking account of the
implications of the increasing convergence
between the two sectors. A Green Paper
published in 1998 noted that rapid
technological advances were having a
significant impact on communications,
acknowledged that developments would
challenge the existing approach to both
economic and content regulation, and sought
views on what regulatory structures might be
more appropriate in the longer term. In a
follow-up report published in June 1999
(Regulating Communications: the Way Ahead),
the Government announced that its preferred
evolutionary and flexible approach to
reforming communications regulation had
received widespread support in responses to
the Green Paper.
THE BBC
A Royal Charter and Agreement govern the
constitution, finances and obligations of the
BBC. The Corporation’s Board of Governors,
including the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and a
National Governor each for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, is appointed by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The
Board of Governors is ultimately responsible
for all aspects of broadcasting by the BBC.
The Governors appoint the Director-General,
the Corporation’s chief executive officer, who
heads the Executive Committee and Board of
Management—the bodies in charge of the
daily running of the Corporation.
The BBC has a regional structure
throughout the UK. The English regions,
BBC Scotland, BBC Wales and BBC
Northern Ireland make television and radio
programmes for their local audiences as well as
contributing to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland advise
on the content of television and radio
programmes intended mainly for reception in
their areas. Ten Regional Councils in England
advise the Board of Governors on the needs
and concerns of their audiences.
BBC Charter and Agreement
In 1996 a new Royal Charter came into effect,
enabling the BBC to continue as the UK’s
main public service broadcaster until 2006.
The Agreement between the BBC and the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, which runs concurrently with the
Charter, formally establishes the
Corporation’s editorial independence in all
matters of programme content, scheduling
and management. It also provides for the
licence fee (see p. 273) to remain the chief
source of finance for the BBC’s public service
activities until at least 2002.
The Charter and Agreement maintain the
BBC’s essential characteristics as a public
corporation; preserve its main objectives of
providing broadcasting services of
information, education and entertainment;
and reinforce the duties placed on the
Governors to maintain programme standards
272
THE MEDIA
and to ensure the Corporation’s accountability
to its audiences. They also allow for the
development of the BBC’s commercial
activities, in partnership with the private
sector, in the UK and abroad (although these
must be funded, operated and accounted for
separately from its licence-fee-funded
services).
Organisation
The structure of the BBC comprises:
• BBC Broadcast, which schedules
channels and commissions services for
audiences in the UK and abroad;
• BBC Production, which develops the
BBC’s in-house radio and television
production capability across all genres
and media;
• BBC News, which is responsible for an
integrated national and international
news operation across the full range of
BBC services;
• BBC Worldwide (see p. 275);
• BBC World Service (see p. 275);
• BBC Resources, a wholly owned
subsidiary which provides support
facilities and expertise to BBC
programme-makers and broadcasters;
and
• the Corporate Centre, which provides
strategic services to the BBC as a whole.
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed predominantly by a licence fee. All
households or premises with a television set
must buy an annual licence (costing £101 for
colour and £33.50 for black and white in
1999-2000).
Licence income (which totalled £2.155
billion in 1998-99) is supplemented by profits
from BBC Worldwide commercial activities,
such as television programme exports, sales of
recordings, publications and other
merchandise connected with BBC
programmes, film library sales, and
exhibitions based on programmes. The BBC
World Service’s radio broadcasting operations
are financed by a grant-in-aid from the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, while BBC
Worldwide Television is self-financing.
In October 1998 the Government
announced an independent review of the
future of the BBC licence fee after 2002,
aimed at ensuring the Corporation’s
continuing ability to meet its public service
obligations and its need to operate effectively
in a competitive market. The review panel
published its report in August 1999, its main
recommendations including:
• a digital licence supplement, on top of
the existing licence fee, to be introduced
from April 2000;
• no introduction of advertising and
sponsorship on the BBC’s public
services;
• partial privatisation of BBC Worldwide
and BBC Resources; and
• reviews of BBC fair trading arrangements
and financial reporting by the Office of
Fair Trading and the National Audit
Office.
BBC Television
The BBC, which launched the world’s first
regular television service in 1936, broadcasts
20,000 hours of television each year on its two
domestic channels to national and regional
audiences:
• BBC ONE is the channel of diverse
appeal. In 1998—99 it broadcast some
1,265 hours of features, documentaries
and current affairs programmes, around
1,100 hours of drama and light
entertainment, just over 600 hours of
sport and nearly 500 hours of children’s
programmes.
• BBC TWO aims for innovation and
originality, with a variety of programmes
including drama, documentaries, arts,
comedy, and leisure and lifestyle shows.
Programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre in London and six
major bases throughout the UK (Glasgow in
Scotland, Cardiff in Wales, Belfast in
Northern Ireland, and Birmingham, Bristol
273
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and Manchester in England); or they are
commissioned from independent producers—
the BBC must ensure that at least 25% of its
original programming comes from the
independent sector.
The Corporation is providing a range of
digital channels to all licence-fee payers,
including:
• an extended BBC ONE and BBC TWO
in widescreen;
• BBC News 24 (see below);
• BBC Choice, a supplementary service to
complement and enhance the network
schedules, which began in September
1998;
• BBC Parliament (coverage of proceedings
in the House of Commons, House of
Lords, the new Parliament in Scotland
and the new assemblies in Wales and
Northern Ireland);
• BBC Knowledge (the UK’s first fully
integrated public service multimedia
learning service), launched in June 1999;
and
• BBC Text, a new graphically enhanced
text and information service.
Education is a central component of the
BBC’s public service commitment on its
domestic channels. A wide range of
educational programmes is broadcast for
primary and secondary schools (over 90% of
which use BBC schools television), further
education colleges and the Open University
(see p. 141), while programmes for adults
cover numeracy, literacy, language learning,
health, work and vocational training. Books,
pamphlets, computer software, and audio and
video cassettes are produced to supplement
the programmes.
BBC News 24, the Corporation’s 24-hour
news channel, began broadcasting in 1997 on
cable services and during the night on BBC
ONE. In 1997 the BBC also launched its
Online channel on the Internet (see p. 287),
with constantly updated news, sport, finance,
travel and other information. As with BBC
News 24, this is funded by the licence fee and
free to users.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio, broadcasting to the
whole of the UK, transmits over 42,000 hours
of programmes each year on its five networks
(broadcasting 24 hours a day):
• BBC Radio 1 (broadcasting on 97-99
FM) is a leading contemporary music
station, serving a target audience of 15-
to 24-year-olds. It plays top-selling, new
and specialist music, covers live
performances and social action
campaigns, and broadcasts features and
news programmes relevant to a young
audience.
• BBC Radio 2 (88-90.2 FM), which
attracts more listeners than any other
national network, offers a broad range of
music (including pop, rock and roll,
rhythm and blues, folk, jazz, country,
brass band and gospel), light
entertainment, documentaries, public
service broadcasting and popular culture.
• BBC Radio 3 (90.2-92.4 FM) offers a
wide repertoire of classical music and
jazz, more than half of which is
performed live or is specially recorded,
together with drama, documentaries and
discussion.
• BBC Radio 4 (broadcast with some
differences on 92.4—94.6 FM and 198
Long Wave) has a backbone of
authoritative news and current affairs
coverage, complemented by drama,
science, the arts, religion, natural history,
medicine, finance and gardening; it also
carries parliamentary coverage and
cricket in season on Long Wave, and
BBC World Service (see p. 275)
overnight.
• Radio 5 Live (693 and 909 MW) offers
news, current affairs and extensive sports
coverage.
The BBC has been transmitting digital
radio since 1995 and currently reaches 60% of
the UK on its own multiplex, which offers
Radios 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Live as well as
coverage of Parliament and additional live
sports events.

THE MEDIA
BBC Worldwide
In 1994 the international and commercial
interests of the BBC were brought together in
BBC Worldwide, to enable the Corporation to
develop its role in the fast-expanding broadcast
and media world. With responsibility for the
BBC’s commercial activity, BBC Worldwide is
a major international broadcaster and a leading
distributor and co-producer of BBC
programmes.
BBC Worldwide works closely with BBC
production departments, independent
producers and its own network of
international offices to determine commercial
strategies for key programmes with
international licensing potential. It is also
developing premium channels to compete in
the international marketplace. Its core service
is BBC World, an advertiser-funded, 24-hour
international news and information channel.
The channel provides news bulletins, in-depth
analysis and reports, and is available to around
135 million homes around the world. BBC
Prime, an entertainment and drama channel
for Europe and Africa, has over 7 million
subscribers.
In its first commercial broadcasting venture
in the UK, the BBC began themed
subscription services in 1997, in partnership
with Flextech pic, under the brand name
UKTV. These services are not funded by the
licence fee.
In 1998 BBC Worldwide signed an
agreement with a US media company,
Discovery Communications Inc., creating a
BBC-branded network (BBC America) in the
United States and jointly developing quality
channels for pay-television around the world.
The agreement is intended to increase
investment in BBC factual programme¬
making and strengthen the international
standing of the Corporation.
BBC Worldwide is the third largest
publishing house in the UK. Its operations
cover magazines, books, videos, audio sales,
CD-ROMs and a commercial on-line service.
BBC World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 42 other languages worldwide. It
has an estimated global weekly audience of over
140 million listeners. This excludes any
estimate for listeners in countries where it is
difficult to survey audiences. The core
programming of news, current affairs, business
and sports reports is complemented by a wide
range of cultural programmes, including
drama, literature and music. The World
Service announced in February 1999 that,
while maintaining short wave broadcasts for
mass audiences, it plans to make programmes
more widely available on FM frequencies and
to deliver services in major languages through
digital broadcasting and on the Internet.
BBC World Service programmes in English
and many other languages are made available
by satellite for rebroadcasting by agreement
with local or national radio stations, networks
and cable operators. The BBC’s Radio
International sells recorded programmes to
other broadcasters in over 100 countries.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm, provides transcripts of radio
and television broadcasts from over 140
countries. As well as providing a vital source
of information to the BBC, this service is used
by other media organisations, government
departments, the commercial sector and
academic institutions.
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is responsible for licensing and
regulating commercial television services
(including BBC commercial services)
operating in, or from, the United Kingdom. It
does not make, broadcast or transmit
programmes itself.
The ITC must ensure that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout the UK and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair and effective
competition in the provision of these services,
and adherence to the rules on media
ownership.
The Commission regulates the various
television services through licence conditions,
codes and guidelines. The codes cover
programme content, advertising, sponsorship
275
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and technical standards. If a licensee does not
comply with the conditions of its licence or
the codes, the ITC can impose penalties.
These range from a formal warning or a
requirement to broadcast an apology or
correction, to a fine. In extreme
circumstances, a company’s licence may be
shortened or revoked.
ITC staff regularly monitor programmes,
and take into account comments from viewers
and audience research. They are also advised
by 12 Viewer Consultative Councils (nine in
England, and one each in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland), and by specialist
committees on educational and religious
broadcasting and advertising.
ITV (Channel 3)
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955. ITV is made up of 15
regionally based television companies which
are licensed to supply programmes in the 14
independent television geographical regions.
There are two licences for London, one for
weekdays and the other for the weekend. An
additional ITC licensee provides a national
breakfast-time service, transmitted on the ITV
network.
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are
awarded for a ten-year period by competitive
tender to the highest bidder (who has to have
passed a quality threshold). Licensees must
provide a diverse programme service designed
to appeal to a wide range of viewers’ tastes and
interests. They have a statutory duty to
present programmes made in, and about, their
region, and there is also a requirement for
district and regional programming to be aimed
at different areas within regions.
Each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These
are produced by the company itself, by other
programme companies, or are bought from
elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least 25% of
original programming must come from the
independent sector. About one-third of the
output is made up of informative
programmes—news, documentaries, and
coverage of current affairs, education and
religion—while the remainder covers drama,
entertainment, sport, arts and children’s
programmes. Programmes are broadcast 24
hours a day throughout the country. A
common national and international news
service is provided by Independent Television
News (ITN).
Channel 3 companies are obliged to operate
a national programme network. The ITV
Network Centre, which is owned by the
companies, independently commissions and
schedules programmes.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees
derive most of their income from selling
advertising time. Their financial resources and
programme production vary considerably,
depending largely on the population of the
areas in which they operate. Newspaper groups
can acquire a controlling interest in Channel 3
companies, although safeguards exist to ensure
against any undue concentrations of media
ownership (see p. 271).
Granada and Carlton, two of the largest
regional ITV (Channel 3) television
companies, jointly own ONdigital, which
occupies three of the six multiplexes licensed
for digital terrestrial television. ONdigital
services were launched in November 1998.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour
television service throughout the UK, except
in Wales, which has a corresponding service—
S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru). Channel 4 is a
statutory corporation, licensed and regulated
by the ITC, and funded by selling its own
advertising time.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide
programmes with a distinctive character and
to appeal to tastes and interests not generally
catered for by Channel 3. It must present a
suitable proportion of educational
programmes and encourage innovation and
experiment. Channel 4 commissions
programmes from the ITV companies and
independent producers, and buys programmes
from overseas.
The fourth channel in Wales is allocated to
S4C, which is regulated by the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority. Members of the Welsh
Authority are appointed by the Government.
S4C must ensure that a significant proportion
of programming—and the majority between
276
THE MEDIA
18.30 and 22.00 hours—is in the Welsh
language. At other times it transmits national
Channel 4 programmes. In November 1998
S4C launched a new digital service
incorporating current analogue Welsh
programmes and additional material. Roughly
15% of S4C’s income comes from advertising,
programme sales, publicity and merchandising;
the remainder comes from a government grant,
the level of which is fixed by statute.
Channel 5
The UK’s newest national terrestrial channel
went on air in March 1997, its ten-year licence
having been awarded by competitive tender to
Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. Channel 5
serves about 70% of the population and is
supported by advertising revenue.
Like Channel 3, the service is subject to
positive programming requirements. It must
show programmes of quality and diversity, with
a wide range of original productions and
commissions from independent producers.
Gaelic Broadcasting
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent body committed to ensuring that a
wide range of quality television and radio
programmes is broadcast in Gaelic for
reception in Scotland. Its members are
appointed by the ITC, in consultation with the
Radio Authority. The Committee distributes
government money to programme makers
through the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund.
The Radio Authority
The Radio Authority’s licensing and
regulatory remit covers all independent radio
services, including national, local, cable and
satellite services. Its three main tasks are to
plan frequencies, appoint licensees with a view
to broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising.
Like the ITC, the Radio Authority has to
make sure that licensed services are of a high
quality, and offer programmes which will
appeal to many different tastes and interests.
It has published codes covering engineering,
programmes, news and current affairs, and
advertising and sponsorship, to which
licensees must adhere.
Independent National Radio (INR)
There are currently three independent national
radio services, whose licences were awarded by
the Radio Authority through competitive
tender, and which broadcast 24 hours a day:
• Classic FM (100-102 FM), which
broadcasts mainly classical music,
together with news and information;
• Virgin 1215 (105.8 FM and 1215 MW),
which plays broad-based rock music (and
is supplemented by a separate Virgin
station which operates under a local
London licence); and
• Talk Radio UK (1053 and 1089 MW),
which is a speech-based service.
The three stations have guaranteed places
on the new national commercial digital
multiplex.
Independent Local Radio (ILR)
Independent local radio stations have been
broadcasting in the UK since 1973. ILR
stations broadcast a wide variety of
programmes and news of local interest, as well
as music and entertainment, traffic reports
and advertising. There are also stations
serving ethnic minority communities. The
Radio Authority awards independent local
licences, although not by competitive tender;
the success of licence applications is in part
determined by the extent to which applicants
widen choice and meet the needs and interests
of the people living in the area and in part by
whether they have the necessary financial
resources to sustain programme plans for the
eight-year licence period. Local radio stations
do not have guaranteed slots on digital local
radio multiplexes.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences (RSLs)—short-term RSLs,
generally for periods of up to 28 days, for
special events or trial services, and long-term
RSLs, primarily for student and hospital
stations, to broadcast to specific establishments.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext Services
Teletext is written copy broadcast on
television sets. There are several teletext
services; one is operated by the BBC and
others by independent television. They offer
constantly updated information on a variety of
subjects, including news, sport, travel,
weather conditions and entertainment. The
teletext system allows the television signal to
carry additional information which can be
selected and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and
graphics on receivers equipped with the
necessary decoders. About 16 million homes
have sets with teletext decoders. The BBC and
Channels 3, 4 and 5 increasingly provide
subtitling for people with hearing difficulties.
The ITC awards teletext licences for the
capacity on Channels 3, 4, and 5 by
competitive tender for a period of ten years.
Applicants have to satisfy certain statutory
requirements before their cash bid can be
considered.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the regulation of cable television
services are carried out by the ITC, while the
Radio Authority issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’ systems can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels using
analogue technology (including terrestrial
broadcasts, satellite television and channels
delivered to cable operators by landline or
videotape), as well as a full range of
telecommunications services. Digital
technology is being introduced which will
support up to 500 television channels. Cable
also has the capacity for computer-based
interactive services such as video-on-demand,
home shopping, home banking, security and
alarm services, electronic mail and high-speed
Internet access (see p. 287). It can
additionally supply television services tailored
for local communities; cable operators are
testing programming concepts to find out
what works best at the local level.
Cable franchises have been granted
covering areas which include 83% of all homes
and nearly all urban areas in the UK.
Regulation is as light as possible to encourage
the development of a wide range of services,
and flexible enough to adapt to new
technology. In April 1999 there were 12.1
million homes able to receive broadband cable
services and 3 million subscribing homes
(representing a TV penetration of 24.5%).
ITC licences are required for systems
capable of serving more than 1,000 homes.
Systems extending beyond a single building
and up to 1,000 homes require only an
individual licence regulated by OFTEL.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from the
ITC, which includes consumer protection
requirements.
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television is transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been available
throughout the UK since 1989. The signals
from satellite broadcasting are received through
specially designed aerials or ‘dishes’. Most
services are paid for by subscription. Some offer
general entertainment, while others concentrate
on specific areas of interest, such as sport,
music, children’s programmes and feature films.
All satellite television services provided by
broadcasters established in the UK are licensed
and regulated by the ITC. Around 200 satellite
television service licences were in force in
January 1999. Many of these are foreign
language services, some of them designed for
ethnic minorities within the UK and others
aimed primarily at audiences in other countries.
Viewers in the UK may also receive a variety of
television services from other European
countries. Satellite services must comply with
the ITC’s programmes, advertising and
sponsorship codes, but they are not subject to
any positive programming obligations.
BSkyB, the UK’s largest satellite
programmer, launched its digital satellite
service (SkyDigital) in October 1998 (carrying
278
THE MEDIA
more than 140 channels). It plans to launch
new interactive services in autumn 1999.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by
the Radio Authority if they are transmitted
from the UK for general reception within the
country, or if they are transmitted from
outside the UK but are managed editorially
from within it.
OTHER ASPECTS
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not raise revenue from
broadcasting advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. Its policy is to avoid
giving publicity to any firm or organised interest
except when this is necessary in providing
effective and informative programmes. It does,
however, cover sponsored sporting and artistic
events. Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on commercial television and radio services,
subject to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes governing advertising
standards and programme sponsorship, and can
impose penalties on broadcasters failing to
comply with them.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast in breaks during
programmes as well as between programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes.
Advertising on terrestrial television is limited to
an average of seven minutes an hour during the
day and seven-and-a-half minutes in the peak
evening viewing period. Advertising is
prohibited in broadcasts of religious services and
in broadcasts to schools. Political advertising and
advertisements for betting (other than the
National Lottery, the football pools and bingo)
are prohibited. All tobacco advertising is banned
on television and cigarette advertisements are
banned on radio. Religious advertisements may
be broadcast on commercial radio and television,
provided they comply with the guidelines issued
by the ITC and the Radio Authority.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In the UK sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial broadcasting,
although the practice has long been
established in other countries. In return for
their financial contribution, sponsors receive a
credit associating them with a particular
programme. The ITC’s Code of Programme
Sponsorship and the Radio Authority’s
Advertising and Sponsorship Code aim to
ensure that sponsors do not exert influence on
the editorial content of programmes and that
sponsorships are made clear to viewers and
listeners. News and current affairs
programmes may not be sponsored. Potential
sponsors for other categories of programme
may be debarred if their involvement could
constrain the editorial independence of the
programme maker in any way. References to
sponsors or their products must be confined to
the beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; they must not
appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
Since September 1998 the ITC has
permitted masthead programming
(programmes with the same title as a magazine
and made or funded by its publishers) on all
UK commercial television services (Channels
3, 4, and 5 having previously been excluded).
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, concerning health, safety
and welfare, are transmitted free by the BBC
and independent television and radio. All
government advertisements and public service
information fdms are subtitled to help people
with hearing difficulties.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations over programme content.
Broadcasters must display, as far as possible, a
proper balance and wide range of subject
matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not
offend against good taste. Broadcasters must
279
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
also comply with legislation relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing rules on
impartiality, the portrayal of violence and
standards of taste and decency in programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing or listening. Television
programmes broadcast before 21.00 hours (or
20.00 hours on certain cable and satellite
services) are required to be suitable for a
general audience, including children.
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC)
The BSC acts as a forum for public concern
about fairness and taste and decency on
television and radio. It decides on complaints
received from the public about taste and
decency, and adjudicates on claims of unfair or
unjust treatment in broadcast programmes
and of unwarranted infringement of privacy in
programmes or in their preparation. It also
undertakes and commissions research and the
monitoring of public attitudes, and has drawn
up a code of practice on both broadcasting
standards and fairness which the broadcasters
and regulators are required to reflect in their
own programme guidelines. In 1998—99 the
Commission received 139 fairness complaints
which were within its remit; 94 fairness
adjudications were completed, of which 63%
were upheld in full or in part. It also received
3,564 complaints about standards (an increase
of 42% on 1997-98); of those adjudicated
upon, 31% were upheld in full or in part (up
from 19% in 1997—98).
Parliamentary Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio, either
live or, more usually, in recorded and edited
form on news and current affairs programmes.
The BBC has a specific obligation to transmit
on radio an impartial account day by day of the
proceedings in both Houses of Parliament. In
October 1998 the Corporation launched a new
seven-day-a-week parliamentary television
service (initially on analogue cable), additional
to, and independent of, its existing coverage of
Parliament. The proceedings of the Scottish
Parliament and the assemblies for Wales and
Northern Ireland are also broadcast live on
occasions and in recorded and edited form on a
regular basis by the BBC.
Party Political Broadcasts
In the absence of paid political advertising in
the UK, there is a long-standing practice that
broadcasters make time available for party
political and election broadcasts on television
and radio. Recent reforms to the system have
been introduced by broadcasters to reflect the
increased number of elections in the UK
following devolution and to re-focus
broadcasts between elections at key times in
the political calendar (for example, the
Budget, the Queen’s Speech and party
conferences). The content of these broadcasts
is the responsibility of the parties, although
they have to comply with ground rules laid
down by the broadcasters. In addition, the
Government may make ministerial broadcasts
on radio and television, with opposition
parties also being allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the commercial sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board).
Joint research is undertaken for BBC radio
and for commercial radio by RAJAR (Radio
Joint Audience Research).
The BBC, the commercial sector and the
BSC conduct regular surveys of audience
opinion on television and radio services.
Public opinion is further assessed by the BBC
and ITC through the work of their advisory
committees, councils and panels.
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION
European Agreements
The UK has implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
280
THE MEDIA
broadcasting—the European Community
Broadcasting Directive (which was revised in
1997) and the Council of Europe Convention on
Transfrontier Television. These aim to ensure
the free flow of television programmes and
services throughout participating countries,
setting minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency, and the
portrayal of sex and violence. If a broadcast
meets these standards then no participating
country may prevent reception in its territory.
Audiovisual Eureka (AYE), which has a
membership of 33 European countries
including the UK, aims to help improve
aspects of the European audiovisual industry
through practical measures to enhance
training, development and distribution. It
concentrates its work on the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe.
The UK participates in the European
Community MEDIA programme, which is
aimed at enhancing the strength of member
states’ national audiovisual industries by
encouraging greater collaboration between
them, and wider distribution of their products.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is responsible
for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes
and news over the Eurovision network and
intercontinental satellite links. It provides a
forum linking the major public services and
national broadcasters of Western Europe and
other parts of the world, and co-ordinates joint
operations in radio and television.
The Press
On an average weekday it is estimated that
well over half of people aged 15 and over in
the UK read a national morning newspaper
(61% of men and 52% of women in
1997—98); nearly 65% read a Sunday
newspaper. Over 85% of people read a
regional or local newspaper. National papers
have an average total circulation of 13 million
on weekdays and about 14 million on
Sundays, although the total readership is
considerably greater.
There are about 1,350 regional and local
newspaper titles and over 7,000 periodical
publications.
Several newspapers have had very long and
distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785.
The press caters for a range of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where they
express pronounced views and show obvious
political leanings in their editorial comments,
these may derive from proprietorial and other
Tn the early days of newspapers the difficulty
was to find news enough to fill the tiny and
intermittent sheets that then appeared.
Nowadays the principal function of a large
editorial staff is to squeeze into the space
available the huge volume of intelligence with
which day by day every newspaper is
overwhelmed. In the first place, there are the
claims of the advertisements, which must
always be the life-blood of any self-supporting
and competitive press . . . The matter which
fills the columns not devoted to advertisements
may be divided into . . . editorial comments,
official announcements, special articles and
correspondence, foreign news, political news
(. . . which includes the debates in
Parliament), law and police reports, city
news (... a review of the state of the money
market and the tendencies of the stock
exchange), sporting intelligence and general
home news . . . Many of the great newspapers
in London and the country have their own
special correspondents in the important
capitals of the world. ’
This is a description of the substance of
the British press by the Harmsworth
Encylopaedia published at the beginning of
the 20th century—not a great deal seems
to have changed.
281
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
non-party influences. Nevertheless, during
General Election campaigns many newspapers
recommend their readers to vote for a
particular political party. Even newspapers
which adopt strong political views in their
editorial columns sometimes include feature
and other types of articles by authors of
different political persuasions.
In order to preserve their character and
traditions, some newspapers and periodicals
are governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements that
try to ensure their editors’ authority and
independence.
Newsprint, more than half of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales revenue,
newspapers and periodicals earn considerable
amounts from their advertising. Indeed, the
press (newspapers, magazines and
directories) is the largest advertising medium
in the UK. Unlike most of its European
counterparts, the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal
concessions.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
Ownership of the national, London and many
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of a
number of large corporations, most of which
are involved in the whole field of publishing
and communications.
The National Press
The national press consists of ten morning
daily papers and ten Sunday papers (see Table
17.1). At one time London’s Fleet Street was
the centre of the new spaper industry, but now
all the national papers have moved their
editorial and printing facilities to other parts
of London or away from the capital altogether.
Editions of several papers, for example the
Financial Times and The Guardian, are also
printed in other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
‘quality’, ‘mid-market’ or ‘popular’ papers on
the basis of differences in style and content.
Five dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers, which are
directed at readers who want full information
on a wide range of public matters. Popular
newspapers appeal to people wanting news of
a more entertaining character, presented more
concisely. ‘Mid-market’ publications cover the
intermediate market. Quality papers are
normally broadsheet (large-sheet) in format
and mid-market and popular papers tabloid
(small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour
and most produce supplements as part of the
Saturday or Sunday paper, with articles on
travel, food and wine, and other leisure
topics.
Regional Newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout the UK
have their own regional or local newspaper.
These range from morning and evening dailies
to Sunday papers and others which are
published just once a week. They mainly
include stories of regional or local attraction,
but the dailies also cover national and
international news, often looked at from a local
viewpoint. They provide a valuable medium
for local advertising.
London has one paid-for evening paper, the
Evening Standard. Its publisher (Associated
Newspapers) also produces a free newspaper,
London Metro, launched in March 1999. There
are local weekly papers for every district in
Greater London; these are often different local
editions of one centrally published paper.
The Daily Record has the highest circulation
of the Scottish papers. A new Scottish
broadsheet, the Sunday Herald, was launched
in February 1999. The weekly press in Wales
includes Welsh-language and bilingual papers.
Welsh community newspapers receive an
annual grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Newspapers from the Irish Republic, as well as
the British national press, are widely read in
Northern Ireland.
Several hundred free distribution
newspapers, mostly weekly and financed by
advertising, are published in the UK. They
have enjoyed rapid growth in recent years.

of the leading regional daily, Sunday and paid-
for weekly newspapers across the UK.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newpapers and magazines in the UK
are produced by members of ethnic
minorities. Most are published weekly,
fortnightly or monthly. A Chinese newspaper,
Sing Tao, the Urdu Daily Jang and the Arabic
Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include The
Gleaner, The Voice and Caribbean Times,
which are all weeklies. The Asian Times is an
English language weekly for people of Asian
descent. Ethnic language publications appear
in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi. The
fortnightly Asian Trader and Asian Business
are both successful ethnic business
publications, while Cinebhtz International
targets those interested in the Asian film
industry.
Muslim News, a free newspaper distributed
weekly across the UK, claims a readership of
over 60,000.
Many provincial papers print special
editions for their local ethnic minority
populations.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
There are over 7,000 separate periodical
publications which carry advertising. They are
generally defined as either ‘consumer’ titles,
providing readers with leisure-time
information and entertainment, or ‘business
and professional’ titles, which provide people
with material of relevance to their working
lives. Within the former category, there are
general consumer titles, which have a wide
appeal, and consumer specialist titles, aimed
specifically at groups of people with particular
interests, such as motoring or classical music.
A range of literary and political journals,
appearing monthly or quarterly, caters for a
more academic readership. There are also
many in-house and customer magazines
produced by businesses or public services for
their employees and/or clients.
The weekly periodicals with the highest
sales are those which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including satellite schedules.
Sky TV Guide circulates over 3 million copies,
while What's on TV and Radio Times have

sales well in excess of 1 million. Reader’s
Digest, which covers a wide range of topics,
has the highest circulation (1.3 million) among
monthly magazines.
Women’s magazines traditionally enjoy
large readerships, while several men’s general
interest titles have reached high levels of
circulation in the 1990s (see Table 17.3).
284
THE MEDIA
Children are well served with an array of
comics and papers, while magazines like
Smash Hits and It's B/iss, with their coverage
of the pop scene and features of interest to
young people, are very popular with teenagers.
Leading journals of opinion include the
Economist, an independent commentator on
national and international affairs, finance and
business, and science and technology; New
Statesman, which reviews social issues,
politics, literature and the arts from an
independent socialist point of view; and the
Spectator, which covers similar subjects from a
more conservative standpoint. A rather more
irreverent approach to public affairs is taken
by Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly.
Weekly listings’ magazines like Time Out
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
There are more than 4,500 business and
professional titles, with the highest
concentrations in medicine, business
management, sciences, architecture and
building, social sciences, and computers.
Controlled (free) circulation titles represent
about two-thirds of the business and
professional magazine market. Around 95% of
business and professional people regularly
read the publications relevant to their sector.

PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members publish
national newspapers, and the Newspaper
Society, which represents British regional and
local newspapers (and is believed to be the
oldest publishers’ association in the world). The
Scottish Daily Newspaper Society represents
the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Publishers
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and Associated
Northern Ireland Newspapers is made up of
proprietors of weekly newspapers in Northern
Ireland. The membership of the Periodical
Publishers Association includes most
independent publishers of business, professional
and consumer journals.
The Society of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It exists to defend press freedom
and to promote high editorial standards. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the
professional organisation for editors of house
journals. Organisations representing
journalists are the National Union of
Journalists and the Chartered Institute of
Journalists. The main printing union is the
Graphical, Paper and Media Union. The
Foreign Press Association was formed in 1888
to help the correspondents of overseas
newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings, and other
services and facilities.
News Agencies
The top international news agencies operating
in the UK are Reuters, Associated Press and
United Press International. The main agency
which gathers news inside the UK is the Press
Association (PA), which provides
comprehensive coverage to the national and
regional print, broadcast and electronic media.
A number of other British and foreign
agencies and news services have offices in
London (for example, Agence France Presse),
and there are smaller agencies based in other
British cities. Most regional agencies are
members of the National Association of Press
Agencies.
285
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
The Press Complaints Commission
In a free society, there is a delicate and
sometimes difficult balance in the relationship
between the responsibilities of the press and the
rights of the public. The Press Complaints
Commission, a non-statutory body, was set up
in 1991 by the newspaper and periodical
industry in response to growing criticism of
press standards, with allegations of unjustified
invasion of privacy and inaccurate and biased
reporting. A policy of self-regulation under the
Commission, rather than statutory control or a
law of privacy, has since been pursued.
The 16-member Commission is drawn from
both the public and the press and has a lay
majority. It deals with complaints about the
content and conduct of newspapers and
magazines, and operates a Code of Practice
agreed by editors covering inaccuracy, invasion
of privacy, harassment and discrimination by
the press. The Commission’s jurisdiction also
extends to publications on the Internet placed
there by publishers who already subscribe to
the Code. In 1998 the Commission dealt with
2,601 complaints, resolving about 87% of cases
pursued under the Code.
Significant revisions to the Code, which
came into effect in 1998, include:
• a recognition of everyone’s entitlement to
respect for their private lives;
• stipulations against the taking of pictures
of people in ‘private places’ (defined as
public or private property where there is
reasonable expectation of privacy);
• a ban on the publication of pictures
obtained as a result of harassment or
‘persistent pursuit’; and
• a requirement that young people should
be free to complete their time at school
without unnecessary press intrusion.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see
P- 271);
• the transfer of newspaper assets; and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agendas and reports of
meetings of local authorities, and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
the printer’s imprint (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see p. 266).
Publication of advertisements is governed
bv wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings; nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. However, these are
restrictions on publication generally, not just
through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of the
media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which has
agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of information
might endanger national security. Details of
these categories are contained in Defence
Advisory Notices (DA Notices) circulated to
the media, whose members are asked to seek
THE MEDIA
advice from the Secretary of the Committee, a
retired senior military officer, before publishing
information in these areas. Compliance with
any advice offered by the Secretary is expected
but there is no legal force behind it and the final
decision on whether to publish rests with the
editor, producer or publisher concerned.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema, direct mail, and
electronic media such as CD-ROM and the
Internet is regulated by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA is an
independent body whose role is to ensure that
everyone who prepares and publishes
advertisements conforms to the British Codes
of Advertising and Sales Promotion. The
Codes are written and enforced by the
advertising industry through the Committee
of Advertising Practice. They require that
advertisements and promotions:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• respect the principles of fair competition
generally accepted in business.
The ASA monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Codes and
investigates any complaints received. Pre¬
publication advice is available to publishers,
agencies and advertisers. If an advertisement
is found to be misleading or offensive, the
ASA can ask the advertiser to change or
remove it. Failure to do so can result in
damaging adverse publicity in the ASA’s
monthly report of its judgments, the refusal of
advertising space by publishers, and the loss of
trading privileges. In the rare cases of
deliberate or persistent offending, the ASA
can also refer misleading advertisements to the
Director General of Fair Trading (see p. 396),
who has the power to seek an injunction to
prevent their publication.
The Media and the Internet
The Internet plays an increasingly important
role in the provision and dissemination of
information and entertainment. Broadly, it is a
loose collection of computer networks around
the world—it links thousands of academic,
government, military and public computer
systems, giving millions of people access to a
wealth of stored information and other
resources. No one owns it—there is no
centralised controlling or regulating body.
Access to the Internet usually requires a
computer with the necessary software, a
telephone and a modem (allowing computers
to talk to each other over a telephone line),
although television-based Internet services are
being developed.
The system dates from the 1960s, when it
began life in the military and academic
communities in the United States, but it has
only assumed widespread significance in
commercial and consumer terms during the
1990s. It is the World Wide Web (WWW or
Web) which has given the Internet its user
appeal and accessibility. The Web consists of
many thousands of pages or ‘sites’ on the
Internet, which can be viewed by a browser (a
programme that provides a window in a
computer screen on which the pages are
displayed). Users can move from page to page
in search of whatever information or service
they are after.
It has been estimated that the number of
pages on the Web is doubling every three
months. Many newspapers and publishing
groups have set up their own websites, for
example the Daily Mail, The Times, The
Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, Financial
Times and the Press Association—and also
prominent magazine publishers, like EMAP
and IPC. There are over 200 regional
newspaper websites, offering a range of
editorial, directory and advertising services.
Broadcasters and regulators, including the
BBC, the ITV companies, Channel 4, Channel
5, Sky and the ITC, are similarly represented.
BBC Online is the most visited Internet
content site in the UK.

UK sportsmen and sportswomen hold world titles in a variety of sports, such as
athletics, rowing, professional boxing, snooker and motorcycle sports. The
Government is working on a new national sports strategy which will embrace
all sections of the community. The United Kingdom Sports Institute is being
set up, with its headquarters in London, as a network of centres of excellence
for UK sport. Funding from the National Lottery is making a substantial
contribution towards financing sport, from grass roots to the highest level.
The most popular participation sports or
activities in the UK are walking (including
rambling and hiking), swimming, snooker/
pool/billiards, keep fit/yoga, cycling and
football. In 1996-97, 71% of men and 57% of
women took part in at least one sporting
activity in the four-week period before they
were interviewed for the General Household
Survey in Great Britain and the Continuous
Household Survey in Northern Ireland.
Walking and cycling are becoming more
popular (see Table 18.1).
Many important sporting events take place
each year in the UK, including the
Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the
Open Golf championship and the Grand
National steeplechase. In 1999 the Cricket
World Cup was staged mostly in the UK, in
May and June, while the Rugby World Cup
will be held in October and November. The
Rugby League World Cup will be staged
mostly in the UK in 2000 and the
Commonwealth Games will take place in
Manchester in 2002.
SPORTS POLICY
A ‘Sports Cabinet’ was established in 1998 to
identify strategic priorities for sport. It is headed
by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport and includes the ministers responsible for
sport in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. The Government intends to publish
early in 2000 a new national sports strategy,
which will be based on:
• improving access to facilities and to
better coaching;
• achieving better health through
participation in sport and active recreation;
• improving sporting performance at all
levels; and
• maximising the potential of sport for
creating wealth and employment.
Extending Sporting Opportunities
The Government wishes to ensure that
sporting opportunities are widely available to

The year 1900 saw the second of the
modern-day Olympics, which were held in
Paris. They were on a relatively small scale,
with just over 100 participants in the
athletics events. On the athletics track UK
winners included Alfred Tysoe in the 800
metres and Charles Bennett in the 1,500
metres, two events in which Britain has been
strong throughout most of the 20th century.
Some sports—such as cricket—already had
established international competitions, but
these were relatively limited. Among the
UK winners in 1900 was one of the nation’s
most successful golfers, Harry Vardon, who
was the first non-US winner of the US
Open. In tennis Reginald Doherty won the
men’s singles at Wimbledon, while he and
his brother Lawrence took the men’s
doubles; the two dominated the men’s
singles at Wimbledon during 1897—1906,
winning in all but one of those years,1 and
were an integral part of the British team
which won the Davis Cup between 1903 and
1906.
The previous year, 1899, had seen a
notable feat in cricket when J. T. Hearne
had taken a hat-trick in the Test against
Australia at Headingley (Leeds). This feat
was not to be repeated by an England bowler
in Tests against Australia until Darren
Gough took a hat-trick in the Sydney Test
in January 1999—only the 23rd hat-trick in
the history of Test cricket.
the entire community, irrespective of age,
gender, social background, location or ability.
Its national sports strategy will be concerned
with how best to target the provision of
sporting facilities on those groups with
below-average participation, including
women, ethnic minorities and the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.
A number of initiatives are in progress to
promote access at all levels of sport. In March
1999 the Government announced a ‘green
spaces initiative’, involving expenditure of

other organisations to apply for grants to
improve their local environment for projects
such as creating playing fields, parks and
green areas from derelict ‘brownfield’ sites.
Tighter planning controls have been
introduced to minimise the loss of playing
fields to development.
There are several initiatives designed to
increase sporting opportunities for young
people, including:
• specialist Sports Colleges, providing
high-quality facilities and training to
support the most talented and promising
pupils, and preparing them for careers in
professional sport, coaching and teaching;
• a Sportsmark scheme to recognise
secondary and special schools that have
effective policies for promoting sport and
a proposed Active Primary School
Award, to help schools with the
development of their physical activity
programmes—in Wales a Sportsmarc
Cymru scheme is open to all schools;
• an Active Schools Programme in
England, designed to encourage sporting
participation and to develop children’s
sports skills;
• in Scotland, Team Sport Scotland
(which has helped 180,000 young people
and 12,000 coaches and teachers since its
inception in 1991), a youth sport strategy,
and a programme to increase levels of
physical activity among young children;
and
• in Wales, the Sports Council for Wales
has introduced two schemes: Dragon
Sport, to increase the profile of sport for
children of primary school age, and Clwb
Cymru, which aims to help children
(mainly between 11 and 16) to progress
291
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
to the club structures provided within the
community.
A number of leading sportsmen and
sportswomen have agreed to become
Sporting Ambassadors under a scheme in
which they visit schools to pass on their
experiences to pupils and teachers and to
promote the benefits of a healthy sporting
lifestyle. In England about 230 sportsmen
and sportswomen from over 30 sports are
involved in the scheme. Ambassadors in
England include Steven Redgrave (rowing)
and Kelly Holmes (athletics).
Promoting Sporting Excellence
Funding of around £20.5 million a year from
the National Lottery Sports Fund is being
earmarked for two main schemes designed to
promote sporting excellence:
• The World Class Performance Programme
provides support to the UK’s most
talented athletes to enable them to
improve their performance and win
medals in major international
competitions. Since April 1997 grants
totalling nearly £65 million have been
committed to more than 30 sports in the
Programme, and 2,100 athletes have
received support. Funding is already
beginning to have a positive effect on UK
performers’ ability to compete at the
highest level in international competitions,
reflected in the performance, for example,
at the World Rowing Championships (see
p. 307) and the World Short Course
Swimming Championships (see p. 309).
• The World Class Events Programme aims
to ensure that major international events
can be staged successfully in the UK.
About £3 million a year is available to
support funding of up to 35% of the cost
of bidding for and staging events. By
mid-1999, £4.6 million had been
awarded to assist with the bidding for
and staging of 13 international events,
with the largest award being for £3
million to assist with the bidding for the
UK to host the football World Cup in
2006.
Lottery funding will also make an
important contribution towards the funding of
the new United Kingdom Sports Institute (see
p. 295).
Ground Safety
The Football Trust is providing grant aid to
help football clubs to complete the safety work
required by the Government in response to
the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough
stadium disaster in 1989, when 96 spectators
died. In England and Wales, licences issued by
the Football Licensing Authority (FLA)
require all clubs in the Premier League and
those in the First Division of the Football
League to have all-seater grounds. In addition,
from August 1999, licences require clubs in
the second and third divisions of the Football
League to ensure that any terracing retained
complies with the highest safety standards, as
outlined in guidance from the FLA. The FLA
will be succeeded by a new Sports Ground
Safety Authority (SGSA), which will have a
wider role in advising other sports on outdoor
ground safety; the SGSA is expected to be in
operation by April 2001. In a related
development, some £65 million will be spent
in England alone over the next four years to
improve standards at cricket, football, rugby
league and rugby union grounds.
In Scotland the all-seating policy is being
implemented through a voluntary agreement
under the direction of the Scottish football
authorities.
Sport on Television and Radio
Major sporting events receive extensive
television and radio coverage and are watched
or heard by millions of people. Football
matches attract very high ratings, especially
when the UK’s national teams are involved in
the final stages of international tournaments—
23.7 million people watched the 1998 World
Cup match between England and Argentina,
the highest ever ratings figure in the UK for a
sports event. A range of other sports,

athletics, also achieve high ratings figures.
For several years, many satellite and cable
channels have concentrated on sport. Live
coverage of a number of major events and
competitions is now shown exclusively by
subscription broadcasters. In the Government’s
view, there are a small number of sporting
occasions to which everyone should have access.
These events are included on a protected list
and cannot be shown on subscription channels
unless they have first been offered to the UK’s
universally available free-to-air broadcasters
(the BBC, the ITV network and Channel 4). In
1998 the list was revised and extended, and it
now protects secondary coverage of certain
events. Live coverage of these Group B events
may be shown by satellite and cable channels on
the condition that an acceptable level of
secondary coverage is made available to the
universally available, free-to-air channels. The
revised list is as follows:

ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities in sport and
recreation are largely channelled through five
Sports Councils:
• the United Kingdom Sports Council,
operating as UK Sport;
• the English Sports Council, operating as
Sport England;
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council, operating as
sportscotland; and
• the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
UK Sport takes the lead on all aspects of
sport and physical recreation which require
strategic planning, administration, co¬
ordination or representation for the UK as a
whole, including the United Kingdom Sports
Institute. It works alongside the Sports
Cabinet in undertaking its main functions,
which include:
• co-ordinating support to sports in which
the UK competes internationally (as
opposed to the four home countries
separately);
• tackling drug misuse;
• co-ordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the UK;
and
• representing British sporting interests
overseas and increasing influence at
international level.
All the Sports Councils distribute
Exchequer and Lottery funds. UK Sport
focuses on elite athletes, while the home
country Sports Councils are more concerned
with the development of sport at the
community level by promoting participation
by all sections of the community, giving
support and guidance to facility providers, and
supporting the development of talented
sportsmen and women, including people with
disabilities. They also manage the National
Sports Centres (see pp. 295-6).
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 410
independent governing bodies. Some have a
UK or Great Britain structure, while others
are constituted on a home country basis. Their
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, and selecting
and training national teams. Governing bodies
receiving funding from the Sports Councils
are required to produce development plans,
from the grass roots to the highest competitive
levels. In order to have access to Lottery
revenue funds for their top athletes, they need
to prepare ‘world-class performance’ plans,
with specific performance targets. There are
also organisations representing people who
take part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking. Most sports clubs in the UK
belong to, or are affiliated to, an appropriate
governing body.
Other Sports Organisations
The main sports associations in the UK
include:
• The Central Council of Physical
Recreation (CCPR), the largest sport and
recreation federation in the world,
comprises 245 UK bodies and 61 English
associations, most of which are governing
bodies of sport. The Scottish Sports
Association, the Welsh Sports
Association and the Northern Ireland
Sports Forum are equivalent
associations. Their primary aim is to
represent the interests of their members
to the appropriate national and local
authorities, including the Sports
Councils, from which they may receive
some funding.
• The British Olympic Association (BOA),
comprising representatives of the 35
national governing bodies of Olympic
sports, organises the participation of
British teams in the Olympic Games,
determines the size of British Olympic
teams, sets standards for selection and
raises funds. It is supported by
sponsorship and by donations from the
private sector and the general public.
The BOA makes important contributions
to the preparation of competitors in the
period between Games, such as arranging
training camps. The BOA also works
through its steering groups to deliver
programmes to national governing bodies
and their athletes in areas such as
acclimitisation, psychology and
physiology. Its British Olympic Medical
Centre at North wick Park Hospital in
Harrow provides medical services for
competitors before and during the
Olympics. Over 300 competitors
represented the UK in the 1996
Olympics winning 15 medals: one gold,
eight silver and six bronze.
• The Women’s Sports Foundation
promotes the interests of women and
girls in sport and active recreation. It
encourages the establishment of women’s
sports groups throughout the UK and
organises events and activities. It runs
both the Sportswomen of the Year
Awards and an annual nationwide awards
scheme for girls and young women
between the ages of 11 and 19.
Sport for Disabled People
The governing bodies of sport are increasingly
taking on responsibility for sport for people
with disabilities. As well as those concerned
with individual disabilities and single sports,
the key organisations are:
• Disability Sport England, which
organises regional and national
championships in many sports and also
runs training courses. Scottish Disability
Sport, the Federation of Sports
Associations for the Disabled (Wales) and
Disability Sports NI have similar co¬
ordinating roles. In England, Sport
England and disability organisations have
co-operated in the formation in April
1999 of the English Federation of
Disability Sport, which aims to integrate
disability sport into mainstream sporting
activities as much as possible;
• the United Kingdom Sports Association
for People with Learning Disability
(UKSAPLD), a co-ordinating body with a
294
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
membership of over 20 national
organisations, which promotes and develops
opportunities in sport and recreation for
people with learning disability; and
• the British Paralympic Association
(BPA), which organises participation by
British athletes in the summer and winter
Paralympics. The BPA is responsible for
the core preparation and management of
the Paralympic team. In 1996, 244 British
competitors participated in the
Paralympics and won 122 medals: 39
gold, 42 silver and 41 bronze.
UK Sport is undertaking a strategic review
of disability sport, with a key objective being
the organisational integration of able-bodied
and disabled sport across a range of sports.
All distributing bodies of Lottery funding
are required to ensure that applicants
incorporate access and availability for people
with disabilities—Sport England has
provided funds of nearly £26 million for 200
projects which specifically target disabled
people. The Government also wishes to see
better facilities for disabled spectators. New
facilities at football grounds will include a
minimum number of wheelchair spaces
offering an unobstructed view of the pitch,
and funding from the Football Trust (see
p. 292) for new facilities will only be given
on condition that football clubs consult
disabled people before work begins.
SPORTS FACILITIES
The UK has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports
Centres, operated by the home country Sports
Councils. Manchester will host the
Commonwealth Games in 2002. Funds of £90
million will be provided for a new 50,000-seat
sports stadium and £22 million for an
Olympic-sized swimming complex.
United Kingdom Sports Institute
The United Kingdom Sports Institute
(UKSI) is being set up under the strategic
Wembley Stadium in London is to be
redeveloped, creating a new 90,000
capacity all-seater national stadium for

million will be provided from Lottery
funding. Wembley National Stadium Ltd,
the Football Association’s development
company, is responsible for building the
new stadium and for its future operation.
The new stadium will be the foundation of
the bid to host the 2006 football World
Cup and to stage other major international
sporting events.
direction of UK Sport and in partnership with
the home country Sports Councils. The aim is
to provide facilities and integrated support
services to potential and elite athletes and
teams. All sports will have access to the
UKSFs services, although it will concentrate
on Olympic sports and those minority sports
lacking a commercial element. The
headquarters will be in London, and there will
be a network of regional centres in England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
UKSFs funds will come mainly from the
National Lottery.
The first UKSI support services are being
launched in 1999. They will include the
Athlete Career Education (ACE UK)
programme, designed to enhance athletes’
personal development and sporting
performance; a High Performance Coaching
Programme; and sports science and medicine
services. The organisation and delivery of
sports medicine, sports science and coaching
services (see p. 297) are expected to change
significantly as a result of the development of
the UKSI.
UKSI Regional Network
England
In England the UKSI network, co-ordinated
by Sport England, will consist of ten centres,
of which four will be based around National
Sports Centres:
295
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• Crystal Palace in London, which is a
leading competition venue for a wide
range of sports and a major training
centre, and has Olympic-size swimming
and diving pools, and a sports injury
centre;
• Bisham Abbey in Berkshire, which caters
for a number of sports, including tennis,
football, hockey, weightlifting, squash,
rugby union and golf;
• Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire, which is used by a variety of
national teams and has extensive playing
fields for football and hockey, together
with facilities for archery and gymnastics;
and
• the National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire,
which is one of the most comprehensive
water sports centres in the world, with
facilities for rowing (including a 2,000-
metre regatta course), canoeing, water-
skiing, powerboating, ski-racing, angling
and sailing—the East Midlands Network
Centre will be jointly based here and
around Loughborough University.
The six other network centres will be based
around the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield,
Gateshead International Stadium, Manchester
Sportcity, Southampton University, the
University of Bath and Bedford Network
Centre.
Wales
The centre of the UKSI network in Wales is
the Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff, run by
the Sports Council for Wales, which is the
premier venue in Wales for top-level training
and for competition in many sports. The
Institute has close links with other specialist
facilities, including the National \\ atersports
Centre at Plas Menai in north Wales, which is
a centre of excellence for sailing and canoeing;
the national indoor athletics centre at
University of Wales Institute Cardiff; and the
cricketing school of excellence at Sophia
Gardens, Cardiff.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
in Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, is
run by Sport England. It offers courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other mountain-
based activities, and is the UK’s leading
training institution for the development of
mountain instructors.
Scotland
A new Scottish Institute of Sport was set up
by the Scottish Sports Council in 1998. It will
receive Lottery funding of £20 million over
the next five years. Initially it is catering for
seven sports—athletics, badminton, curling,
football, hockey, rugby and swimming—and
there will be six area centres. The Scottish
Sports Council runs three National Sports
Centres:
• Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore, which
caters for a range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
skiing, kayaking and canoeing;
• Inverclyde in Largs, which has many
indoor and outdoor facilities, including a
gymnastics hall, golf training, and sports
medicine and sports science facilities of
an international standard; and
• the Scottish National Water Sports
Centre—Cumbrae—on the island of
Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde.
Northern Ireland
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has
announced a partnership with the University
of Ulster for the development of a Northern
Ireland netw ork centre of the UKSI. This w ill
involve creating high-quality training facilities
and support services, primarily at the
University’s Jordanstown campus, with the
establishment of links with nearby facilities. It
is envisaged that the centre will include the
development of an indoor training centre,
athletics training track, sports medicine
facilities, a 50-metre training pool and outdoor
pitches, with support services such as sports
science and coaching.
The Tollymore Mountain Centre in
County Down, run by the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland, offers courses in
mountaineering, rock climbing, canoeing and
outdoor adventure. Leadership and instructor
296
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
courses leading to nationally recognised
qualifications are also available.
Local Facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
local community. In England they manage
over 1,500 indoor sports centres. Other
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
playgrounds, tennis courts, artificial pitches,
golf courses and swimming/leisure pools.
Over 150,000 voluntary sports clubs are
affiliated to the national governing bodies of
sport. Some local clubs cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those which
provide sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Many clubs linked to businesses and
other employers cater for sporting activities.
Commercial facilities include fitness centres,
tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving
ranges, riding stables and marinas.
SUPPORT SERVICES
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute
(NSMI), funded by UK Sport and Sport
England, is responsible for the co-ordination
of sports medicine services. Based at the
medical college of St Bartholomew’s Hospital,
London, its facilities include a physiology
laboratory, library and information centre.
In Scotland a network of 26 accredited
sports medicine centres provides specialist
help with sports injuries. Wales has 11 sports
medicine centres, accredited by the NSMI,
which are linked closely with the UKSI
network in Wales. The Northern Ireland
Sports Medicine Centre is a partnership
between the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland and a local healthcare trust.
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the British
Olympic Association and the National
Coaching Foundation, in an effort to raise the
standards of performance of national squads.
The type of support provided may cover
biomechanical (human movement),
physiological or psychological factors.
Coaching
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
works closely with sports governing bodies, local
authorities, and higher and further education
institutions. Supported by the Sports Councils,
it provides a comprehensive range of services for
coaches in all sports. Since 1983 the NCF has
provided educational and development
opportunities for 115,000 coaches. In 1998,
15,000 coaches and 12,000 schoolteachers
participated in NCF programmes.
DRUG MISUSE
UK Sport aims to prevent doping and achieve a
commitment to drug-free sport and ethical
sporting practices. Its Ethics and Anti-Doping
Directorate co-ordinates a drugs-testing
programme and conducts a comprehensive
education programme aimed at changing
attitudes to drug misuse. Samples are analysed
at a laboratory accredited by the International
Olympic Committee, at King’s College,
University of London; UK Sport is responsible
for reporting the results to the appropriate
governing body. In 1998-99 the drugs-testing
programme involved nearly 60 national
governing bodies and 22 international sporting
federations from 38 sports. A total of 5,147 tests
were conducted—3,141 in competition and
2,006 out of competition—and 98.5% were
negative. UK Sport provides a Drug
Information Line to allow athletes to check
whether a licensed medication is permitted or
banned under their governing body’s
regulations, and issues a comprehensive guide
on drugs and sport for competitors and officials.
The UK is at the forefront of work to establish a
new International Anti-Doping Agency.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in the UK. In
addition to professional sportsmen and
297
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
sportswomen, around 400,000 people are
employed in the provision of sports clothing,
publicity, ground and club maintenance and
other activities connected with sport. A joint
Department of Trade and Industry/Sports
Industries Federation competitiveness
analysis, published in July 1999, found that
the UK sports industry is worth almost £5
billion a year. The private sector makes a
substantial investment in sport, with more
than 2,000 UK companies involved. The
sports sponsorship market was estimated to be
worth £353 million in 1998.
Recent examples of sponsorship include:
• the 1999 Cricket World Cup, which
had four official sponsors—Emirates
Airlines, National Westminster Bank,
Pepsi and Vodafone;
• the England football team, which is
being sponsored by the Nationwide
Building Society in a deal worth £15
million over four years; and
• the Millennium Youth Games, for
which airport operator BAA is the
lead sponsor—this is a series of
events over three years in which more
than 300,000 people are expected to
participate, with a Grand Final in
Southampton just before the Sydney
Olympics.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as
horse races or cricket leagues, or grants to
sports organisations or individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship, which is
encouraged by a number of bodies, including:
• the Institute of Sports Sponsorship
(ISS), which comprises some 100 UK
companies involved in sponsoring sport;
and
• the Sports Sponsorship Advisory
Service, administered jointly by the
CCPR (see p. 294) and the ISS, and
funded by Sport England, and similar
advisory services of the Scottish Sports
Council and the Sports Council for
Wales.
Under the EC’s Tobacco Advertising
Directive (see p. 186), the Government
intends to ban tobacco sponsorship of sport
from 2003 in most cases and from 2006 for
certain exceptional global events. It has set up
a task force of business and sponsorship
experts to help the sports affected. Seven
sports have sought assistance to make the
transition—rugby league, clay pigeon
shooting, billiards and snooker, pool, darts, ice
hockey and angling.
Sportsmatch
Sportsmatch aims to increase the amount of
business sponsorship going into grass roots
sport and physical recreation. It offers
matching funding for new sponsorships and
for the extension of existing ones. Priority is
given to projects involving disabled people,
the young and ethnic minorities and to
projects in deprived areas.
In England the ISS runs the scheme on
behalf of Sport England. Since 1992
Sportsmatch has approved 2,492 awards in
England, totalling £19.6 million and covering
about 70 different sports. Football, rugby
union, cricket, tennis and basketball have
received most awards.
In Scotland and Wales the scheme is
managed by the appropriate Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service.
National Lottery Awards
Sport is one of the main recipients of funds
raised by the National Lottery. By June 1999
awards totalling over £1 billion had been made
to nearly 3,000 projects in the UK. Around 60
sports have received Lottery funding, with
projects ranging from the provision of small
items of equipment to the building of major
sports venues.'
Some of the funds from the Millennium
Commission (see p. ix) are also for sporting
and recreational developments. Major
schemes include £46 million for the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff (see p. 308),
and £42.5 million for a new national cycle
network (see p. 366).

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
SportsAid
SportsAid (the Sports Aid Foundation) raises
funds to help talented young British
sportspeople meet their personal training
expenses and realise their sporting potential.
Assistance is given to those needing financial
help and is concentrated on individuals who
do not qualify for awards from the National
Lottery Sports Fund. SportsAid raises its
funds by commercial sponsorship and by
donations from companies, local authorities,
voluntary organisations and members of the
public. Scottish SportsAid, SportsAid Wales
and the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust
have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, set up
by the football pools promoters in 1991, funds
small-scale projects in sport and the arts. This
initiative followed the 1991 Budget, in which
pools betting duty was reduced by 2.5%,
provided that the money forgone by the
Government was paid into the new Foundation;
a further cut in duty announced in the 1999
Budget will ensure that funding continues until
at least 2002. The Foundation has made awards
to schemes benefiting over 100 sports.
Betting and Gaming
Most betting in Great Britain continues to be
on horse racing and greyhound racing,
although betting on other sporting events,
such as football, is becoming more popular.
Bets may be placed with on-course
bookmakers at racecourses and greyhound
tracks, or off-course through over 8,000
licensed betting offices. In addition, telephone
and Internet betting has grown steadily. A
form of pool betting—totalisator betting—is
organised on racecourses by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (the Tote), which also has a
credit betting operation and a chain of off-
course betting offices. In May 1999 the
Government announced its intention to
introduce legislation to sell the Tote.
A proportion of horserace betting turnover
by bookmakers and the Tote is returned to the
racing industry through an annual levy. The
levy is based on a scheme agreed each year
between the Bookmakers’ Committee and the
Horserace Betting Levy Board. If agreement
cannot be reached, it is determined by the
Home Secretary. The Levy Board distributes
the levy to promote the improvement of horse
breeds, and for the advancement of veterinary
science and the improvement of horse racing.
Gross expenditure on all forms of
gambling, including the National Lottery, is
estimated at approximately £40 billion a year.
New opportunities for the betting and gaming
industry and the consumer have arisen
through, for example, a relaxation on
membership conditions and advertising of
casinos (of which there are 119 in the UK),
and on broadcast advertising of commercial
bingo.
POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in the UK, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below.
Angling
Angling is one of the most popular sports,
with an estimated 3 million anglers in the UK.
In England and Wales the most widely
practised form of angling is for coarse fish
(freshwater fish other than salmon or trout).
The rivers and lochs of Scotland and in Wales
are the main areas for salmon and trout
fishing. Separate organisations represent
game, coarse and sea fishing clubs in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and
there are separate competitions in each of the
three angling disciplines.
The UK has several world champion
anglers. In 1998 Alan Scotthorne won the
world freshwater fishing championships for
the third year running, and England took the
men’s team title. Jimmy Jones won the world
shore championships and Scotland took the
men’s team title.
Athletics
In the UK athletics incorporates many
activities, including track and field events,
299
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
cross country and road running, race walking,
and fell and hill running. The governing body
for the sport is UK Athletics, which was set
up in February 1999.
One of the major developments has been
the significant growth in mass participation
events, notably marathons and half marathons.
The largest UK marathon is the London
Marathon each April, with a record 31,600
runners taking part in the 1999 event. The
Great North Run, a half marathon, takes place
between Newcastle upon Tyne and South
Shields, and in October 1998 attracted 40,000
runners. In these and other similar events,
many runners are sponsored, raising
considerable amounts for charities and other
good causes.
British athletes held world records in two
events in mid-1999: Jonathan Edwards in the
triple jump, achieved in 1995 when he became
the first man to jump beyond 18 metres; and
Colin Jackson in the 110 metre hurdles
(achieved in 1991). British athletes won six
medals in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, with
silver medals for Jonathan Edwards and for
Roger Black (400 metres), Steve Backley
(javelin) and the men’s 4 x 400 metres relay
team; and bronze medals for Denise Lewis
(heptathlon) and Steve Smith (high jump). In
the 1999 World Athletics Championships in
Seville (Spain) British athletes won seven
medals: a gold medal for Colin Jackson (110
metres hurdles), four silver medals—Denise
Lewis (heptathlon), Dean Macey (decathlon),
Paula Radcliffe (10,000 metres) and the men’s
4 x 100 metres relay team—and two bronze
medals, for Dwain Chambers (100 metres) and
Jonathan Edwards (triple jump). Earlier in
1999, at the world indoor championships,
Colin Jackson won a gold medal in the 60
metres hurdles, while two other UK athletes
were gold medallists: Jamie Baulch (400
metres) and Ashia Hansen (triple jump).
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. According to the latest
research, around 2 million people play
badminton regularly. The Badminton
Association of England has a coach education
system to develop coaches for players of all
levels and a development department with a
network of part-time county development
officers.
The All England Badminton
Championships, staged at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is one of the world’s
leading tournaments. At the World
Championships in May 1999 in Copenhagen,
Simon Archer and Joanne Goode were
runners-up in the mixed doubles, and Simon
Archer and Nathan Robertson reached the
semi-finals of the men’s doubles, while Kelly
Morgan (who won a gold medal at the 1998
Commonwealth Games) achieved a win over
the then world champion in the women’s
singles where she reached the quarter-finals.
Basketball
Over 3 million people participate in basketball
in the UK. The English Basketball
Association is the governing body in England,
with similar associations in Wales, Scotland
and Ireland (Ulster Branch). All the
associations are represented in the British and
Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as the
co-ordinating body for the UK and the Irish
Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, which cover four divisions
for men and two for women, while there are
also leagues for younger players. Mini¬
basketball has been developed for players
under the age of 13. Wheelchair basketball is
played under the same rules, with a few basic
adaptations, and on the same court as the
running game.
The English Basketball Association runs
various development schemes for young
people which aim to increase participation and
improve the quality of basketball. With
support from National Lottery funds, some
6,000 outdoor basketball goals have been
installed in parks and play areas in England
under a scheme to encourage recreational
participation in the sport, and a further 4,000
will be installed in 1999—2000.

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
About 6,000 flat green lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and
Irish Bowling Associations, which, together
with Women’s Bowling Associations for the
four countries, play to the laws of the World
Bowls Board. Crown green bowls and indoor
bowls have their own separate associations.
The World Bowls Tour now organises bowls
at the professional level. Proposals for a single
world governing body are under discussion.
British bowlers have achieved considerable
success in international championships. At the
world outdoor championships (held every four
years) the winners at the most recent event,
held in Adelaide in 1996, included Tony
Allcock, who became the first man to defend
the singles title successfully, and Scotland,
winners of the team title. At the 1999 world
indoor championships, held in Hopton-on-Sea
(Norfolk), Alex Marshall won the singles
event, while Steve Rees and John Price won
the pairs title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In the UK boxing is
both amateur and professional, and in both
strict medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of
England. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and boxing in Northern
Ireland is controlled by the Irish Amateur
Boxing Association. The associations organise
amateur boxing championships as well as
training courses for referees and coaches.
Headguards must be used in all UK amateur
competitions. The first residential boxing
academy, with places for up to 30 16- to 18-
year-olds, will begin operating in September
1999 at the Peterlee sports site of East
Durham Houghall Community College.
Professional boxing in the UK is controlled
by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints referees, timekeepers,
inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed, and that contests take place under
carefully regulated conditions. Medical
controls and safety measures must be in place
at all licensed tournaments, to minimise the
risk to boxers. The Board nominates
challengers for British championships and
represents the interests of British licensed
boxers in the international championship
bodies of which it is a member.
Lennox Lewis is the World Boxing Council
(WBC) heavyweight champion, and in March
1999 he drew his title fight with Evander
Holyfield of the United States (who holds two
other versions of the heavyweight title). The
UK currently has five other world champions
(as recognised by organisations of which the
British Boxing Board of Control is a member):
Naseem Hamed, who holds the World Boxing
Organisation (WBO) featherweight title;
super-middleweights Joe Calzaghe (WBO)
and Richie Woodhall (WBC); Johnny Nelson
(WBO cruiserweight); and Jason Matthews
(WBO middleweight).
The first licensed women’s professional
boxing match in the UK took place in
London in November 1998 when Jane
Couch from the UK (world welterweight
champion) beat a German opponent.

Chess
There are local chess clubs and leagues
throughout the UK, and chess is also played
widely in schools and other educational
establishments. Domestic competitions
include the British Championships, the
National Club Championships and the County
Championships. The Hastings Chess
Congress, which started in 1895, is the world’s
longest running annual international chess
tournament.
The governing bodies are the British Chess
Federation (responsible for England and for
co-ordinating activity among the home
nations), the Scottish Chess Association and
the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
England won the European Team
Championship for the first time in 1997. A
301
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
number of UK chess players feature among
the world’s best, including Michael Adams
and Nigel Short.
Chess is not currently recognised as a
sport, but the Government has announced
plans to make it so by introducing
legislation in Parliament.
Cricket
The rules of cricket became the responsibility,
in the 18th century, of the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC), based at Lord’s cricket
ground in north London, and it still frames
the laws today. The England and Wales
Cricket Board (ECB) administers men’s and
women’s cricket in England and Wales. The
Scottish Cricket Union administers cricket in
Scotland.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages. There is a
network of first-class cricket, minor counties
and club games with a variety of leagues. The
professional cricket competitions are in the
process of being restructured. The main
competition is the PPP Healthcare County
Championship, played by 18 first-class county
teams in four-day matches. From 2000 it will
be played in two divisions. Three main one-
day competitions were held in 1999: the
NatWest Trophy, the Benson & Hedges
Super Cup and the CGU National Cricket
League, which was split into two divisions for
the first time.
England hosted the 1999 World Cup,
involving 12 countries. Around 476,800
spectators watched the matches, and the
worldwide television audience was
estimated at 2 billion. The final at Lord’s
was won by Australia, who beat Pakistan
by 8 wickets.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and one or more touring
teams from Australia, India, New Zealand
(who toured England in 1999), Pakistan,
South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West Indies or
Zimbabwe. A team representing England
usually tours one or more of these countries in
the UK winter.
Cycling
Cycling includes road and track racing, time-
trialling, cyclo-cross (cross country racing),
touring and bicycle moto-cross (BMX). All-
terrain or mountain bikes are increasingly
popular.
The British Cycling Federation has 14,000
members and is the internationally recognised
governing body for British cycling as a sport.
The Road Time Trials Council controls road
time trials and has more than 1,000 member
clubs. In 1998 over 100,000 rides were
completed in open time trials in England and
Wales. The CTC (Cyclists’ Touring Club),
with 65,000 members and affiliates, is the
governing body for recreational (including off¬
road) and urban cycling, and holds the CTC
rally each year in York. CTC Scotland
represents cyclists in Scotland, Wales has its
own Cycling Union and Northern Ireland also
has separate federations for competitive cycling.
Chris Boardman is the UK’s most
successful current cyclist. He won the 4,000
metres pursuit title at the World Cycling
Championships in 1996 and was one of two
UK bronze medallists in cycling—along with
Max Sciandri—at the Atlanta Olympics.
Equestrianism
Leading horse trials, comprising dressage,
cross-country and show jumping, are held at a
number of locations. The Badminton Horse
Trials, sponsored by Mitsubishi Motors, is
one of the UK’s largest sporting events,
attracting around 250,000 spectators. The
major show jumping events include the Horse
of the Year Show at Wembley in London and
the Hickstead Derby in West Sussex.
The British Equestrian Federation (BEF)
acts as the international secretariat on behalf of
its members, which include the British Show
Jumping Association, the British Horse Trials
Association, British Dressage, British Horse
Driving Trials Association, British Endurance
302
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Riding Association and British Equestrian
Vaulting. These associations act as the
governing bodies of the different sporting
disciplines in the UK and oversee the
organisation of the major national and
international events. The British Horse
Society, which includes British Riding Clubs, is
responsible for promoting training, road safety,
rights of way and the welfare of horses, while
the Pony Club provides training for children.
At the 1998 World Equestrian Games in
Rome, the British team won a bronze medal in
show jumping, through the team of Geoff
Billington, Di Lampard, Nick Skelton and
John Whitaker. In September 1999 the three-
day event team—consisting of Jeanette
Brakewell, Pippa Funnell, Tina Gifford and
Ian Stark—won the European Championships
a Luhmuhlen (Germany), and Pippa Funnell
won the individual title.
Exercise and Fitness
Exercise and fitness is a term covering a
variety of activities—such as exercise to
music, aqua exercise, weight training and
circuit training—which aim to improve health
and fitness. Exercise England is the national
governing body in England for exercise and
fitness, and aims to promote a positive
approach to sport and health. It maintains the
English Exercise and Fitness Register, which
lists qualified teachers/instructors, and is
designed to protect the public by raising
standards and promoting codes of practice.
The Keep Fit Association (KFA), which has
1,500 teachers and a membership of 12,000,
promotes fitness through movement, exercise
and dance for people of all ages and abilities.
Its national certificated training scheme for
KFA teachers is recognised by local education
authorities throughout the UK. Autonomous
associations serve Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
Field Sports
Field sports in the UK include hunting,
shooting, stalking and hare coursing. Fox
hunting with a pack of hounds is the most
popular hunting sport. There are over 300
recognised packs of quarry hounds in the UK,
of which more than 180 are foxhound packs
recognised by the Masters of Fox Hounds
Association. A number of hunts organise
‘point-to-point’ race meetings (see p. 305).
The Countryside Alliance promotes the
interests of field sports.
A private member’s Bill seeking to ban
hunting with hounds received a second
reading in the House of Commons in 1997,
with a substantial majority in favour, but did
not become law owing to a lack of
parliamentary time.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs
to regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 full
and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered
clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish
Football Association.
In England the FA Premier League
comprises 20 clubs. A further 72 full-time
professional clubs play in three main divisions
run by the Football League. Over 2,000
English League matches are played during the
season, from August to May. A £40 million
scheme has been introduced to establish new
centres of excellence for coaching and
developing young players, with a contribution
of £20 million from the FA Premier League
being matched by £20 million from Sport
England’s Lottery Fund.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland a new Scottish Premier League, with
ten clubs, held its first fixtures in 1998. A
further 30 clubs play in the Scottish Football
League, equally divided into three divisions.
In Northern Ireland, 16 semi-professional
clubs play in the Irish Football League.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup (sponsored by AXA) and the
League Cup (the Worthington Cup) in
England, the Tennents Scottish Cup, the
303
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Scottish League Cup, the Irish Cup and the
Welsh FA Cup.
The Football Task Force was established in
1997 to advise on a range of issues affecting
football. It has issued reports on disabled
access, racism and community involvement.
The Government has taken steps to implement
the recommendations which are its concern,
and has asked the other bodies named in the
report to implement the recommendations
concerning them. The Task Force’s final
report, on the commercial aspects of the game,
is due to be produced later in 1999.
Football has seen an influx of money,
particularly into the top British clubs (such as
Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Rangers
and Celtic), and a number of the leading clubs
are quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
Many leading footballers from other countries
are now playing in the top divisions in the UK.
Footballers feature strongly among the UK’s
highest paid sports performers, with several
receiving over £1 million a year (including their
earnings from sponsorship).
Following the success in staging the
European Championship finals in 1996, the FA
has submitted a bid to host the World Cup in
2006. Both England and Scotland played in the
final stage of the 1998 World Cup in France.
Manchester United won the European Cup
(the final of the European Champions League)
in May 1999 when they beat Bayern Munich
in Barcelona. This followed winning the FA
Premier League and the FA Cup in 1998—99,
the first English club to win all three events in
the same season.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, handball, hurling, camogie (women’s
hurling) and rounders. There are over 700
clubs in Northern Ireland affiliated to the
Gaelic Athletic Association and the Camogie
Council, the official governing bodies
responsible for Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and since 1897 the
rules have been administered worldwide
(excluding the United States) by the Royal
and Ancient Golf Club (R & A), which is
situated at St Andrews. The Golfing Union of
Ireland and parallel unions in Wales, Scotland
and England are the national governing bodies
for men’s amateur golf. These bodies are
affiliated to the R & A and are represented on
the Council of National Golf Unions, which is
the UK co-ordinating body responsible for
handicapping and organising home
international matches. Women’s amateur golf
in Great Britain is governed by the Ladies’
Golf Union. Club professional golf is
governed by the Professional Golfers’
Association (PGA) and tournament golf by the
European PGA Tour and the European
Ladies Professional Golfers’ Association.
Women’s golf in the home countries is
governed by the English Ladies Golf
Association, the Welsh Ladies Goll Union,
Scottish Ladies Golf Association and the Irish
Ladies Golf Union.
The main tournament of the British golfing
year is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s four ‘major’ events. Other important
competitions include the World Matchplay
Championship at Wentworth; the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States; and the Ryder Cup and
Solheim Cup matches for men and women
professionals respectively, played every two
years between Europe and the United States.
There are over 2,000 golf courses in the
UK. Some of the most famous include St
Andrews, Royal Lytham and St Anne’s, Royal
Birkdale, and Carnoustie.
The 1999 British Open Championship, held
at Carnoustie, was won by Paul Lawrie after a
three-way play-off. Both Lee Westwood (the
winner of several tournaments recently) and
Colin Montgomerie (who headed the European
list of money winners in 1998 for the sixth year
running) are ranked in the world’s top ten. In
the women’s game Alison Nicholas won the US
Women’s Open in 1997 and Laura Davies has
recorded several recent wins.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of the UK’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 5 million
304
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
spectators a year. The rules for the sport are
drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing
Club (NGRC), the sport’s judicial and
administrative body. The representative body
is the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Meetings are usually held three times a
week at each track, with at least ten races a
meeting. The main event of the year is the
Greyhound Derby, run in June at Wimbledon
Stadium, London. Tracks are licensed by local
authorities. There are 33 major tracks that
operate under the rules of the NGRC and
around 45 smaller tracks.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into seven main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics,
general gymnastics, sports aerobics,
trampolining and gymnastics and movement
for people with disabilities.
The governing body for the sport is British
Gymnastics, to which 800 clubs are affiliated.
It is estimated that between 3 and 4 million
schoolchildren take part in some form of
gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including running,
cycling and dancing. The heavyweight events
are the most popular and include throwing the
hammer, tossing the caber and putting the
shot. Over 70 events of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous
being the annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was founded in
England in 1886. A single association—the
England Hockey Association—now governs
men’s and women’s hockey in England; there
are similar single associations in Scotland and
Wales. Cup competitions and leagues exist at
national, divisional or district, club and school
levels, both indoors (six-a-side) and outdoors,
and there are regular international matches and
tournaments. The National Hockey Stadium
in Milton Keynes, opened in 1996, is the venue
for all major hockey matches in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two main forms—flat
racing and National Hunt (steeplechasing and
hurdle) racing. The turf flat race season lasts
from late March to early November, but all-
weather flat racing and National Hunt racing
take place throughout the year. The UK has
59 racecourses and about 12,000 horses
currently in training. Point-to-point racing,
restricted to amateur riders on horses which
are qualified by going hunting, takes place
between January and June, and is growing in
popularity.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both held at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). The meeting at Royal Ascot in
June is another significant flat racing event.
The most important National Hunt meeting is
the National Hunt Festival held at
Cheltenham in March, which features the
Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, since the 1830s, is the world’s best-
known steeplechase.
In April 1999 Richard Dunwoody became
the most successful National Hunt jockey
in the UK, when he rode his 1,679th
winner, overtaking the previous record
held by Peter Scudamore.
As the governing authority for racing, the
British Horseracing Board (BHB) is
responsible for the fixture list, race
programmes, relations with the Government
and the betting industry, and central
marketing. The Jockey Club, as the regulatory
authority, is responsible for licensing,
discipline and security.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ice Hockey
Ice hockey is a significant indoor spectator
sport, with over 2 million spectators each season
and attendances growing. Eight teams contest
the British Superleague, and 16 the Benson &
Hedges Cup. A further eight teams take part in
the British National League, run by the British
Ice Hockey Association, while ten teams are
involved in the English Premier League.
There are around 7,500 players in the UK.
Ice Skating
Ice skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
synchronised skating. Participation in ice
skating is concentrated among the under-25s,
and is one of the few sports that attracts more
female than male participants. The governing
body is the National Ice Skating Association of
UK Ltd, to which 75 clubs are affiliated.
There are over 70 rinks in the UK. A new rink
has opened at the Deeside Leisure Centre in
north Wales, and plans are in hand for other
new rinks, including two double ice rink
facilities at Nottingham and Sheffield, both of
which will receive funding from the National
Lottery Sports Fund.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive sport
and self-defence technique, but also as a means
of general fitness training. An internationally
recognised grading system is in operation
through the sport’s governing body, the British
Judo Association. Birmingham will stage the
world championships in October 1999. At the
previous championships in 1997 Kate Howey
won the middleweight title. Karina Bryant has
won the world junior heavyweight title and was
European champion in 1998, while Debbie
Allan won the featherweight title at the 1999
European Championships.
Martial Arts
Various martial arts, mainly derived from the
Far East, are practised in the UK. There are
recognised governing bodies for karate,
ju-jitsu, aikido, Chinese martial arts, kendo,
taekwondo and tang soo do. The most popular
martial art is karate, with over 100,000
participants.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying and
karting. In motor racing the Formula 1 Grand
Prix World Championship is the major form of
the sport. The British Grand Prix is held at
Silverstone (Northamptonshire) each July.
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in the UK is The Royal
Automobile Club Motor Sports Association,
which issues licences for a variety of
competitions. It also organises the Rally of
Great Britain, an event in the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix.
The UK has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country. The most
recent is Damon Hill (son of Graham Hill, a
previous world champion), who won the 1996
World Championship and has won 22 Grand
Prix. Three other British drivers, all of whom
are Grand Prix winners, are currently in
Formula 1: David Coulthard, Johnny Herbert
and Eddie Irvine; Eddie Irvine was in second
place in the World Championship in
September 1999.
UK car constructors, including McLaren
and Williams, have enjoyed outstanding
success in Grand Prix and many other forms
of racing. Most of the cars in Formula 1 have
been designed, developed and built in the UK.
The UK motor sport industry is estimated to
generate an annual turnover of over £1.3
billion (of which exports account for 60%) and
to employ more than 50,000 people.
Colin McRae won the World Rally
Championship in 1995, and finished second in
1996 and 1997, and third in 1998.
Motorcycle Sports
Motorcycle sports include road racing, moto-
cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing, enduro (endurance off-road racing)
and sprint. There are between 40,000 and
50,000 competitive motorcyclists in the UK.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
306
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
The major events of the year include the Isle
of Man TT races and the British Road Race
Grand Prix. The Auto-Cycle Union also
provides off-road training by approved
instructors for riders of all ages.
Carl Fogarty has been by far the most
successful rider in the World Superbike
Championships since they began in 1988. In
1999 he won the event for the fourth time,
following successes in 1994, 1995 and 1998. In
1999 he recorded his 50th individual victory.
Mountaineering
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council (BMC), which works
closely with the Mountaineering Councils of
Scotland and Ireland. The main areas of work
include access and conservation. The BMC
estimates that the number of active climbers is
around 150,000, not including the many hill
walkers. There are over 300 mountaineering
and climbing clubs in the UK, and three
National Centres for mountaineering activities
run by the Sports Councils (see pp. 296-7).
UK mountaineers have been prominent
among the explorers of the world’s great
mountain ranges. The best-known is Sir Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other expeditions.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball regularly
in England and a further 1 million young
people play in schools. The sport is played
almost exclusively by women and girls.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
separate organisations. National competitions
are staged annually for all age-groups, and
England plays a series of international matches
against other countries, both in England and
overseas.
Rowing
Rowing takes place in many schools,
universities and rowing clubs throughout the
UK. The main types of boats are single, pairs
and double sculls, fours and eights. The
governing body in England is the Amateur
Rowing Association; similar bodies regulate
the sport in Scotland, Wales and Ireland
(Ulster Branch).
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews from
all over the world compete each July in various
kinds of race over a straight course of 1 mile
550 yards (about 2.1 km).
Steven Redgrave has won four successive
Olympic gold medals, a feat achieved by only a
very few people in Olympic history. He and
Matthew Pinsent won the gold medal in the
coxless pairs in both the 1992 and 1996
Olympics. Together with Ed Coode and James
Cracknell, they won a gold medal in the
coxless four event in the world championships
in Ontario in 1999, and the coxless four is
expected to be a strong medal contender in the
Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000. At the
1999 world championships the UK also won
four silver medals.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby union
(see p. 308) of 22 clubs in the north of England,
where the sport is still concentrated. In the UK
there are 32 professional clubs, with about 1,000
professional players, and some 400 amateur
clubs with a total of around 40,000 players.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League, while the
amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The
major domestic club match of the season is the
Challenge Cup Final.
The main leagues now take place in the
summer rather than the winter. The JJB
Super League consists of 14 clubs: 13 from the
north of England and one from London. In
1999 the other two divisions merged, forming
the Northern Ford Premiership with 18 clubs.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Sixteen nations are expected to contest the
World Cup in 2000, which will be staged in
England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and France.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game) is
thought to have originated at Rugby School in
the first half of the 19th century. The sport is
played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union in England and parallel bodies
in Wales, Scotland and Ireland (Ulster
Branch). Each of the four countries has
separate national league and knock-out
competitions for its domestic clubs.
The last Five Nations Championship,
contested by England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland (a team from the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland) and France, was held in
1999 (and won by Scotland). This will be
succeeded in 2000 by the Six Nations
Championship when Italy joins the
competition. Overseas tours are undertaken by
the national sides and by the British or Irish
Lions, a team representing Great Britain and
Ireland. Tours to the UK are made by teams
representing the major rugby-playing nations.
The 1999 Rugby World Cup is taking place
in Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and
France. Twenty teams will contest the event.
The final will be in November at the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which has
been rebuilt. It now has a capacity of 72,500
and is the world’s biggest stadium with a
retractable roof.
Ulster succeeded Bath as European club
champions when they won the European Cup
in January 1999, beating Colomiers of France
in the final.
Skiing and Other Winter Sports
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December
to May and also at several English locations
when there is sufficient snow. The five
established winter sports areas in Scotland are
Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, the Lecht and
Nevis Range. All have a full range of ski-lifts,
prepared ski-runs and professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-
slopes throughout the UK, and 1.5 million
people take part in the sport. The British Ski
and Snowboard Federation is the
representative body for international
competitive skiing and snowboarding. The
four home country ski councils are responsible
for the development of the sport, mainly
through coaching, race training and arranging
competitions.
The four-man bobsleigh team of Sean
Olsson, Dean Ward, Paul Attwood and
Courtney Rumbolt won a bronze medal at the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano in Japan.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is played by approximately 7
million people in the UK. British players have
an outstanding record and have dominated the
major professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in Sheffield.
In 1999 Stephen Hendry regained the title to
register his seventh victory, a record number
of wins since the event has been staged at
Sheffield.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association organises all
world-ranking professional events and holds
the copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in the UK is
estimated at over 2 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
308
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
In September 1999 Peter Nicol won the
World Championships in Cairo, regaining the
position of world number one; in 1998 he had
finished runner-up in the World
Championships and had been the first UK
winner of the British Open for 25 years.
Suzanne Horner and Sue Wright both reached
the semi-finals of the 1998 World Open
Championships in Stuttgart. In early 1999 the
UK had eight men and nine women in the
respective top 20 world rankings.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport and form of
exercise for people from all age-groups.
Competitive swimming is governed by the
Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) in
England and by similar associations in
Scotland and Wales. Together these three
associations form the Amateur Swimming
Federation of Great Britain, which co¬
ordinates the selection of Great Britain teams
and organises international competitions.
Instruction and coaching are provided by
qualified teachers and coaches who hold
certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
In the 1996 Olympics Paul Palmer gained a
silver medal in the 400 metres freestyle and
Graeme Smith a bronze medal in the 1,500
metres freestyle. At the World Short Course
Championships in Hong Kong in April 1999
the British team won four gold medals: Mark
Foster (50 metres freestyle and 50 metres
butterfly), James Hickman (who retained his
200 metres butterfly title) and the women’s 4 x
100 metres freestyle relay team. At the
European Championships in Istanbul in July
1999, Paul Palmer (in the 400 metres freestyle)
and Sue Rolph (100 metres freestyle) won
gold medals, while Tony Ali took gold in the
3 metre diving event.
Table Tennis
Table tennis originated in England in the
1880s and was particularly popular at the
beginning of the 20th century. Today it is
played by all age-groups and social groups,
and in a variety of venues, ranging from small
halls to specialist, multi-table centres. It is also
a major recreational and competitive activity
for people with disabilities. The governing
body in England is the English Table Tennis
Association. There is also an English Schools
Association and separate associations in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1873 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), to which
Tennis Wales and the Scottish LTA are
affiliated. Tennis in Northern Ireland is
governed by Tennis Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. They attracted a record 457,000
spectators in 1999 and generated £33 million
for British tennis in 1998. Prize money
totalled £7.6 million in 1999.
The two leading British players—Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski—are both ranked
in the world’s top ten. Tim Henman reached
the semi-finals in the 1998 and 1999
Wimbledon Championships, while Greg
Rusedski was runner-up in the 1997 US Open.
In the 1996 Olympics Neil Broad and Tim
Henman were runners-up in the men’s doubles.
About 5 million people play tennis in the
UK. There are national and county
championships, while national competitions
are organised for schools. Short tennis has
been introduced for children aged five and
over.
The LTA has a five-year plan for
developing tennis in Great Britain, with the
aim of expanding participation, encouraging
regular competition and producing more
world-class tennis players. Tennis facilities are
being improved, and about £40 million will be
provided by the LTA towards more indoor
tennis centres, clay courts and floodlit courts.
Over 50 community tennis partnerships have
been established between local authorities,
schools and tennis clubs, creating almost 300
club-school links involving over 2,000 schools.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Yachting
Yachting/boating comprises yacht and dinghy
racing and cruising, powerboat racing, motor
cruising and windsurfing, on inland and
offshore waters. The Royal Yachting
Association (RYA) is the national governing
body for boating in the UK and aims to make
boating in all its forms as accessible as
possible; it also includes RYA Sailability, the
charity for disabled sailors. About 4.75 million
people participate in the sport. Among well-
known yachting events in the UK are the
Admiral’s Cup, Cowes Week and the Fastnet
Race.
At the 1996 Olympics, silver medals were
won by Ben Ainslie in the Laser class and by
John Merricks and Ian Walker in the 470
double-handed dinghy class. Ben Ainslie won
the Laser class world championship in
Melbourne in January 1999. Jonathan Jones is
a world powerboating champion, having won
the World Formula One title in December
1998. Nik Baker is currently the World Indoor
Windsurfing Champion on the Professional
Windsurfing Association World Tour.

Sustainable development is becoming increasingly recognised and promoted,
both in the UK and internationally. A widely used international definition is
‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs’, or as the Government
has explained it: ‘ensuring a better quality of life for everyone, now and for
generations to come’. The Government has recently adopted a new strategy for
sustainable development on the UK, including 14 ‘headline indicators’ against
which progress will be monitored. A new Sustainable Development
Commission will be set up in 2000 to help monitor progress.
Introduction
The UK’s first strategy on sustainable
development was published in 1994, following
the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992
(the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development). In May 1999
the Government published a revised
strategy—A Better Quality of Life: A Strategy
for Sustainable Development for the UK. This
differs from its predecessor by emphasising
the importance of considering social progress
alongside the more familiar issues of the
economy, environment and resource use. It
stresses the importance of integrated policies
in meeting four broad objectives at the same
time, in the UK and the world as a whole:
• social progress which meets the needs of
everyone;
• effective protection of the environment;
• prudent use of natural resources; and
• maintenance of high and stable levels of
economic growth and employment.
The establishment in 1999 of the Scottish
Parliament and the National Assembly for
Wales means that, where matters are
devolved, the new administrations will decide
how to proceed in the light of their country’s
particular circumstances. Thus while some of
the policies described in this strategy apply to
the UK as a whole, others are exclusive to
England: some publications of the devolved
administrations are listed in the Further
Reading section.
Sustainable development requires
international co-operation on matters such as
trade, the relief of global poverty and
environmental problems. For the UK, the
European Union (EU) is especially influential.
Changes to the Treaty of Rome, agreed in the
Treaty of Amsterdam (see p. 80), give
sustainable development a much greater
prominence in Europe, by making it a
requirement for environmental protection
concerns to be integrated into EU policies.
The Treaty states that the particular objective
311
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
of this requirement is to promote sustainable
development.
In working towards these broad objectives,
government policy will take account of ten
guiding principles and approaches:
• putting people at the centre of concerns
for sustainable development;
• taking a long-term perspective;
• taking account of costs and benefits;
• creating an open and supportive
economic system;
• combating poverty and social exclusion;
• respecting environmental limits;
• the precautionary principle—it is no
longer acceptable to say, ‘we can’t be sure
that serious damage will happen, so we’ll
do nothing to prevent if;
• using scientific knowledge;
• transparency, information, participation
and access to justice; and
• making the polluter pay.
Indicators of Sustainable Development
The most widely used measure of the
economic progress of the nation is Gross
Domestic Product (GDP, see p. 382), but the
limitations of this single measure in the
context of sustainable development are well
known. In 1998, the Office for National
Statistics produced a first set of
Environmental Accounts for the UK—linking
environmental statistics with GDP and
national accounts. The Government would
like to see the use of a wider range of ‘headline
indicators’ of sustainable development,
covering social and environmental issues
alongside such well-established economic
measures as GDP, inflation and
unemployment.
The UK published a set of approximately
120 indicators of sustainable development in
1996. The new UK strategy includes a revised
and expanded set of about 150 indicators,
including 14 ‘headline indicators’. This will
enable the Government to monitor and report
on progress (or otherwise) towards targets,
and give a broad overview of whether a ‘better
quality of life for everyone, now and for
generations to come’ is being achieved. The 14
headline indicators, covering economic, social
and environmental concerns, are:
• total output of the economy (GDP);
• investment in public, business and
private assets;
• the proportion of people of working age
who are in work;
• qualifications at age 19;
• expected years of healthy life;
• the number of homes judged unfit to live in;
• the level of recorded crime;
• emissions of greenhouse gases;
• days when air pollution is moderate or
high;
• the amount of road traffic;
• rivers of good or fair quality;
• populations of wild birds;
• new homes built on previously developed
land; and
• the amount of waste and its management.
A core series of indicators, linked to the
national ones, is also being developed
specifically for local authorities to use.
Government Role
The Government is committed, as part of its
strategy for sustainable development, to
integrating environmental considerations into
its decision-making at all levels, and in every
sphere of its activity—the Greening
Government Initiative.
A Green Minister has been appointed in each
main Whitehall department. Individually, they
act as advocates for sustainable development
and the environment within their own
departments and their associated agencies and
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
Collectively, they meet regularly under the
chairmanship of the Environment Minister, in
the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR), to share
best practice and to ensure that systems are in
place across the public sector to bring the
environment into policy-making and the
running of buildings and facilities.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Some Indicators of the Quality of Surroundings, England
Source: Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions
Green Ministers focus particularly on
ensuring that there is an effective system for
environmental appraisals of policy and, in
terms of greening operations, on energy
efficiency, waste management, staff travel and
procurement. They have also taken action to
introduce Environmental Management
Systems to help departments better manage
their environmental impacts.
Green Ministers report to the Cabinet
Committee on the Environment, which has
responsibility, at the strategic level, for
ensuring that environmental considerations
are fully integrated into all areas of policy, to
help achieve sustainable development. The
Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister.
The Government has also created the
parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee
to scrutinise how far the policies and
programmes of government departments,
agencies and NDPBs contribute to
environmental protection and sustainable
development. In doing so, the Committee
undertakes a range of inquiries, including
regular investigations of progress on the
Greening Government Initiative.
A Sustainable Development Unit was set up
within the DETR in 1997 as a focal point for
government policy, strategy and planning on
sustainable development. It works closely with
other departments and is able to offer advice on
how best sustainable development can be taken
into account in managing policy and operations.
One of the Unit’s activities is promoting
freedom of access to information on the
environment. The UK intends to ratify the
1998 (UN Economic Commission for Europe)
Aarhus Convention on Access to Information,
Public Participation in Decision-Making and
Access to Justice in Environmental Matters.
New legislation is required first, however, and
has been proposed in the draft Freedom of
Information Bill (see p. 58).
The British Government Panel on Sustainable
Development is an independent body which
313
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
advises government on issues of major
strategic importance to sustainable
development. In 1998 it reviewed four major
topics: sustainable development and
employment; environmental issues and the
EU; land-use legislation governing National
Parks and Green Belts; and community and
indigenous peoples’ intellectual property
rights over biological resources.
The UK Round Table on Sustainable
Development brings together representatives of
business and local government, academics and
others to discuss relevant issues, and makes
recommendations to government. In the first
half of 1999 it published reports on Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises and on the Devolved
and Regional Dimensions of sustainable
development.
In 2000 both the Panel and the Round
Table will be absorbed into a new Sustainable
Development Commission, whose main
responsibility will be to monitor progress on
sustainable development and build consensus
on action to be taken by all sectors to
accelerate its achievement.
Other organisations set up to help
formulate, or implement, policy in this area
are the Advisory Committee on Business and
the Environment (see p. 316), the Trade
Unions and Sustainable Development
Advisory Committee, and Going for Green,
which seeks to persuade individuals and
groups to commit themselves to sustainable
development (in Scotland, this role is taken by
Forward Scotland).
Local Agenda 21
At the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992,
an ‘Agenda for the 21st Century’ was adopted
by the international community. It set out a
framework of objectives and activities for
governments and major groups of civil society,
including business, on sustainable
development necessary for the 21st century.
Two-thirds of the actions in Agenda 21
require the full involvement of local
authorities, and Chapter 28 of the Agenda
encouraged them to adopt a ‘Local Agenda 21’
by 1996.
The Government wants all UK local
authorities to have adopted a Local Agenda 21
strategy by the year 2000, and reported in
March 1999 that 88% had either produced
one or committed themselves to doing so. The
aim of such strategies is to integrate
sustainability into all local policies and
activities, such as: economic development and
employment; health action plans; housing;
energy conservation; local transport; air
quality management; recycling; and local
biodiversity action plans.
Taxes
‘Green taxes’ are one tool available to
government in its efforts to promote
sustainable development. Recent Budgets (see
p. 406) have introduced reductions of up to
£500 in Vehicle Excise Duty for lorries and
buses with clean exhausts, and a ‘fuel duty
escalator’, whereby road-fuel duty will
increase by 6% each year in real terms. It is
estimated that the escalator will cut UK
emissions of carbon dioxide (C02) by
2 million to 5 million tonnes (of carbon
equivalent) by 2010, by encouraging more
fuel-efficient vehicles, more economical
driving styles and less vehicle use.
One tax measure in 1998 increased the
difference in duty between ultra low sulphur
diesel (ULSD) and standard diesel from 1 to 3
pence a litre over two years, in order to reduce
emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides.
By February 1999 the proportion of ULSD
sold was 43% and a further increase in the
duty differential in the March 1999 Budget
increased this percentage to 96% by August
and is expected to convert the whole diesel
market to ULSD by the end of the year.
Since June 1999, 1.8 million small cars with
an engine size of 1,100 cc or less have
benefited from a reduced annual rate of
Vehicle Excise Duty from £155 to £100.
From autumn 2000 owners of all new cars will
pay duty according to their car’s rate of C02
emissions. Another measure announced in the
1999 Budget is the reform of the company car
tax regime from 2002. This will encourage the
use of more fuel-efficient cars.
Perhaps the most radical tax reform is the
proposed ‘climate change levy’ (see p. 488) on
the use of energy in business and the public
sector from 2001, to reduce emissions of C02,
314
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
the principal greenhouse gas (see p. 337). The
overall tax burden on the non-domestic
sectors will not increase, however, nor will
their competitiveness be damaged, since the
levy will be offset by a corresponding cut in
the level of employers’ National Insurance
contributions, and by other financial
incentives to promote energy efficiency and
the use of renewable sources of energy.
Other recent Budget measures include a
reduction in value added tax (VAT) on the
installation of energy-saving materials, so that
more low-income households can afford to
insulate their homes; further increases in the
landfill tax (for waste disposal—see p. 331) in
an attempt to encourage recycling and
increases in tax credits for voluntary financial
contributions by landfill operators to
environmental bodies. The Government is
also considering the introduction of taxes or
charges on the quarrying of aggregates (sand,
gravel and crushed rock), if the industry
cannot agree to a system of voluntary
environmental improvements, and on
pesticides.
Education and Training
In 1998 the Government set up an expert
panel (for England) to consider the provision
of education for sustainable development in
schools, youth services, further and higher
education, at work and at home. In April 1999
the panel published proposals for a ten-year
programme, which included the
recommendation, for schools, that all children
should be entitled to education for sustainable
development. This entitlement would be
delivered through the National Curriculum
(see p. 136), backed up by appropriate initial
and in-service teacher training, and monitored
by the school inspection framework.
In Scotland, education for sustainable
development has been led by a group of
experts, associated with the Advisory Group
on Sustainable Development, since 1995, and
is now well integrated into the Scottish
curriculum. The Environmental Education
Council for Wales has developed a Welsh
educational strategy, and launched the first
phase of its Environment Network Centres in
1998.
The Environment Task Force (ETF), one
of four options available to 18-24 year olds
under the New Deal for the Young
Unemployed (see p. 154), was launched in
1998. The ETF aims to improve long-term
employment prospects through a combination
of high-quality work experience and training.
It consists of projects which deliver benefits in
line with the Government’s sustainable
development policies and objectives.
Business and the Consumer
The Government has launched a number of
initiatives to help business improve its
environmental awareness and consumers to
make environmental choices about what they
buy and from whom. For example, households
are being encouraged not only to recycle their
waste, but also to buy products that contain
recycled material.
Sectoral sustainability strategies provide
the framework for addressing the ‘triple
bottom line’—integrating action and setting
priorities to improve business performance on
economic, environmental and social aspects.
The Government is encouraging trade
associations and other representative bodies to
develop and implement strategies within at
least six business sectors by the end of 2000,
building on existing initiatives and best
practice.
In March 1999 the Government published
a strategy for ‘sustainable distribution’ (see
p. 366). As well as improving the efficiency
of distribution, its main aims are to reduce
the number of accidents, injuries and cases
of ill health, noise and disturbance
associated with freight movements, and to
minimise congestion and pollution. This
will involve better use of the transport
infrastructure and land-use planning
framework, and will help to deliver fair
and open markets for UK producers,
consignors and operators of freight
transport services.
The Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme (ETBPP), launched in 1994, is an
eight-year programme which promotes the use
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
of better environmental practices that reduce
business costs for industry and commerce. It
provides information and advice on
environmental technologies and techniques by
means of publications, events, and a freephone
UK helpline. By 1999 the ETBPP had
stimulated savings for businesses of £70
million a year as a result of their adopting
better environmental practices and cleaner
technology. The ETBPP works in partnership
with the Energy Efficiency Best Practice
Programme (EEBPP, see p. 489) which
supports energy efficiency measures. In April
1999 the Government launched the
Sustainable Technologies Initiative (STI), to
build on the ETBPP and the EEBPP. The
STI will provide £7.8 million of support over
the next three years for the development of
new technologies that will help businesses to
be more efficient in their use of resources, and
produce less waste and pollution.
The environmental industries sector—
including companies that specialise in producing
cleaner technology, clean-up technology and
environmental monitoring systems—is a growth
area of the British economy. In 1997 the sector
achieved an annual turnover of about £7.5
billion, of which exports accounted for £0.7
billion or 4.4% of the global market.
The Queen’s Awards for Environmental
Achievement are presented in recognition of
products, technology or processes developed
by British industry which offer major
environmental benefits compared with the
existing competition. Awards are granted only
for products, technology or processes which
have achieved commercial success. In 1999,
there were five awards, including for:
• the Jesse Brough Metals Group of Hixon
in Staffordshire, for recycling of furnace
waste;
• Exotherm Products Ltd of Cardiff, for
energy-efficient electric heaters
(‘Insulwatt’); and
• Synetix of Billingham in Cleveland, for
fixed-bed catalytic destruction
technology for waste sodium
hypochlorite.
The Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment (ACBE) consists of business
leaders appointed by the Government and
serving in a personal capacity. It gives advice
to government on environmental issues of
concern to business; provides a link with
international business initiatives on the
environment; and helps to mobilise the
business community through demonstrating
good environmental practice. In October 1998,
ACBE published its eighth progress report,
which contained 50 recommendations on how
businesses can act on issues ranging from
climate change and transport policy to
sustainable consumption and the use of water
resources.
Many leading companies now address
environmental issues in their annual reports,
and several publish separate environmental
performance reports. The Government is
encouraging the top 350 UK businesses to
measure, reduce and report on their emissions
of C02 and other greenhouse gases. For
example, the Royal Mail has reported a C02
reduction of almost 12% between 1990 and
1997 for each letter delivered.
Environmental Management Systems
In 1996, the International Organisation for
Standardisation (ISO) published ISO 14001, a
standard which allows organisations to
evaluate how their activities, products and
services affect the environment, and gives
them a systematic approach to improving their
overall environmental performance.
Certification is achieved only after an audit of
the organisation’s environmental management
system by an independent body, such as the
British Standards Institution (see p. 392).
Accreditation of certification bodies in the UK
is carried out by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service (UKAS). By April
1999, 899 organisations in the UK had
UKAS-accredited ISO 14001 certification,
out of a global figure of 2,892 UKAS-
accredited certificates.
The Government will sponsor work on
development of a ‘sustainability management
system’ to help integrate sustainable
development into the plans and operations of
companies.
The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS), developed by the European
Commission, is a voluntary scheme applicable
316
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
to industry, although it has been extended in
the UK to local government as well. In
Britain, registrations to EMAS are lodged
with the Institute of Environmental
Assessment. The environmental management
system element of EMAS corresponds to ISO
14001. However, EMAS also requires a
published environmental statement, which
provides the public with independently
validated information on the organisation’s
environmental performance. By June 1999
over 70 industrial sites in the UK and four
local authorities had registered under the
scheme.
Environmental Labelling
Consumers are increasingly making
environmental choices in the goods they buy
and often rely on the information given in
product labels. To help them, the
Government is keen to promote accurate and
relevant environmental labelling, as part of an
integrated approach to reducing the
environmental impact of consumer products.
In 1998, the Government launched a
voluntary Green Claims Code which sets out
guidance for businesses making environmental
claims about their products. This code has
been endorsed by the Confederation of British
Industry, the British Retail Consortium and
the Local Authority Co-ordinating Body on
Food and Trading Standards. The principles
have been developed further in a new
international standard on environmental
labelling—ISO 14021—which was adopted in
1999.
The Government has established the
Market 1 ransformation Programme to
encourage more energy-efficient domestic
appliances, including a graded Energy Label
to permit the easy comparison of products.
Following a consultation process, the
Government has wound up the UK
Ecolabelling Board and has taken over the
running in the UK of the voluntary EU
Ecolabelling scheme. The Government is also
considering options for possible new labelling
initiatives and has set up the Advisory
Committee on Consumer Products and the
Environment to assist the development of a
comprehensive approach to consumer product
policy and strategic environmental labelling
issues.
In May 1999 the Government embarked
on a £25 million ‘Are You Doing Your Bit1
publicity campaign to communicate the
key elements of its new Sustainable
Development Strategy to the general
public in England over the next three
years. The campaign will reinforce and
complement the activities of Going for
Green, local authorities and other
organisations, and will draw attention to
the simple everyday actions everyone can
take to save money and reduce waste.
In 1999—2000, the Environmental
Action Fund, which supports voluntary
programmes to encourage more
sustainable lifestyles, is giving funding of
£4 million to some 165 initiatives.
Biodiversity
Another outcome of the 1992 ‘Earth Summit’
was the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Among its many obligations, the Convention
required its 170 signatory countries (including
the UK) to develop national strategies for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity, and in particular to protect the
world’s growing number of endangered
species. The UK was one of the first countries
to publish a national strategy and action plan
(in 1994) and to carry out pioneering work in
developing costed targets for individual
species and habitats. The partnership engaged
in carrying this work forward has involved
government departments and their agencies;
local authorities; industry; academic
institutions and scientific collections; farming;
land management; and voluntary sector
conservation organisations.
In 1995, the UK Biodiversity Steering
Group published a report which included, for
the first time, fully costed action plans for the
conservation of 116 species and 14 habitats, and
recommendations for programmes to improve
biological recording and monitoring, and public
awareness. By autumn 1999 action plans for 391
species and 45 habitat action plans will be in
317
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
place. Over 100 local biodiversity action plans
are at various stages of implementation. The
targets and programmes contained in these
plans will form a basis for nature conservation in
the UK in the 21st century.
Since the 1992 ‘Earth Summit’ the UK has
committed £160 million in support of
biodiversity programmes (such as the
management of ecosystems, research, training
and education) in 53 developing countries. It
has also committed £215 million to the Global
Environment Facility, which supports the
Convention on Biological Diversity. The UK
continues to participate in international efforts
to implement the Convention and intends to
play a key role at the next meeting of the
Conference of the Parties to the Convention,
to be held in Nairobi in May 2000. The UK is
keen to reconvene the Extraordinary Meeting
of the Conference of the Parties to discuss and
conclude negotiations on a Biosafety Protocol,
which would regulate the transboundary
movement of living modified organisms. The
aim of the Protocol is to secure protection for
the global environment while avoiding the
creation of unnecessary barriers to trade.

Environmental matters affect the formulation of policy in all areas. An
integrated Environment White Paper is planned before the end of the current
Parliament, together with a Rural White Paper and major policy documents on
chemicals and waste. Government funding for countryside and wildlife
programmes in England and Wales will rise from £122 million in 1999-2000 to
£150 million in 2001-02.
Conservation
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England. The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS) has responsibility for archaeology
and the identification, recording and
protection of the built heritage in England.
The Scottish and Welsh Offices had broadly
equivalent responsibilities until mid-1999,
when they passed to the newly created
Scottish Executive and National Assembly for
Wales. The Northern Ireland Office also has
broadly equivalent responsibilities. All these
bodies delegate many of their conservation
functions to the agencies described below. In
addition, local authorities and many voluntary
organisations are actively involved in
environmental conservation and protection.
The Countryside and Wildlife
Countryside and Wildlife Agencies
The Countryside Agency has a duty both to
promote the conservation and enhancement of
the English countryside and to increase the
opportunities for the public to enjoy it and
promote economic and social development of
rural areas. It was created in April 1999 by a
merger of the Countryside Commission and
part of the Rural Development Commission
(founded by Lloyd George with his ‘People’s
Budget’ of 1909). It has a budget of nearly £50
million for 1999—2000. The Agency works
with a range of partners in central and local
government, and with the private and
voluntary sectors. It will publish its long-term
strategy and priorities in summer 2000, taking
account of the Government’s proposed Rural
White Paper.
319
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Various dates are put forward for the
founding of the modern conservation
movement in the UK. The years 1970-71
were undoubtedly an important milestone:
in 1970 the word ‘environment’ first
achieved government departmental status
with the creation of the Department of the
Environment, and in 1971 the voluntary
organisations Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace were founded. However, the
environment was already a matter of
concern around the end of the 19th
century—even if not the issue of social,
economic and political importance that it
is today. For example, the formation in
1877 of the Society for the Protection of
Ancient Buildings was followed in 1889
by the founding of the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, originally to
protest against the wholesale killing of
birds for their plumage. In 1895 the
National Trust was formed to preserve
places of historic interest and natural
beauty, while 1908 saw the establishment
of the Royal Commissions on historic
monuments for England, Scotland and
Wales, and in 1912 the Society for the
Promotion of Nature Reserves was
formed.
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the
Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) have
responsibilities in Scotland and Wales for
landscape conservation and countryside
recreation similar to those of the Countryside
Agency in England and also for nature
conservation. In Northern Ireland, the
Environment and Heritage Service (EHS)
protects and manages landscapes, habitats and
species, and also has an environmental
protection role.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are
responsible for providing advice to the
Government and public information on nature
conservation; for notifying land of special
interest for its wildlife, geological and natural
features; and for establishing National Nature
Reserves. These three agencies operate
through the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC) to fulfil their
responsibilities for Great Britain as a whole
and for international conservation matters. All
of these agencies support and conduct their
own environmental research.
The ‘Countryside Survey 2000’, which first
began in 1978, has been developing a national
audit of habitats and landscape features in
Great Britain to mark the millennium; a
similar survey has been undertaken in
Northern Ireland. The results will show how
the British countryside has changed over the
past ten years and will be used to help assess
whether policies for a sustainable countryside
are working.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Agency and the CCW can
designate National Parks and Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs),
subject to confirmation by the Secretary of
State for the Environment, Transport and the
Regions and the National Assembly for Wales
in their respective countries.
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales (see map at the
beginning of the book). Their aims are to
conserve and enhance their natural beauty,
wildlife and cultural heritage, and to promote
opportunities for the understanding and
enjoyment by the public of the areas they
cover. They are ‘national’ in the sense that
they are of special value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. Each Park is administered by an
independent National Park Authority.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads are also
administered by their own independent
authority and enjoy protection equivalent to
that of a National Park. Since 1994 the
planning policies that apply to the National
Parks have applied also to the New Forest
Heritage Area in Hampshire. (For general
planning policy see chapter 21.)
A total of 41 AONBs have been designated
in England and Wales. They comprise areas of
national landscape quality, but the promotion
of recreation is not an objective of their
designation. The Government is considering
advice from the Countryside Agency on
strengthening the arrangements for managing

and protecting AONBs, the South Downs and
the New Forest.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas (NSAs),
together covering some 11,000 sq km (4,250 sq
miles). In NSAs certain developments are
subject to consultation with SNH and, in the
event of a disagreement, with the Scottish
Executive. Two areas of outstanding natural
importance—the Cairngorms, and Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs—will shortly
become National Parks, subject to legislation
by the Scottish Parliament (see p. 24).
In Northern Ireland the Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Government on the preservation of amenities
and the designation of AONBs. Nine such
areas have been designated and two more
(Erne Lakeland and Fermanagh Caveland)
have been proposed for designation.
Forest and Country Parks
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering nearly 3,000 sq km (1,150 sq miles),
which are administered by the Forestry
Commission (see pp. 464-5). Northern
Ireland has eight Forest Parks, three Forest
Drives and over 40 minor forest sites, all
administered by the Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture.
The Countryside Agency recognises over
200 country parks and more than 250 picnic
sites in England. A further 35 country parks in
Wales are recognised by the CCW, and there
are also 36 country parks in Scotland.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County, metropolitan and unitary councils in
England and Wales (see p. 62) are responsible
for keeping public rights of way signposted
and free from obstruction. Public paths are
usually maintained by these ‘highway
authorities’, which also supervise landowners’
duties to repair stiles and gates. In Scotland
planning authorities are responsible for
asserting and protecting rights of way. Subject
to public consultation, and, if necessary, a
public inquiry, local authorities in Great
Britain can create paths, close paths no longer
needed for public use, and divert paths to
meet the needs of either the public or
landowners. Farmers in England and Wales
are required by law to restore any cross-field
public paths damaged or erased by agricultural
operations. England has about 169,000 km
(106,000 miles) of rights of way and Wales
about 40,000 km (25,000 miles). In 1998 the
Isle of Wight became the first local authority
in England to achieve the National Target for
rights of way, set in 1987, which required
authorities to have all their public rights of
way legally defined, properly maintained and
well publicised before the millennium.
There are 13 approved National Trails
open in England, stretching more than 3,000
km (nearly 2,000 miles), two in Wales
covering about 510 km (320 miles), and three
Long Distance Routes in Scotland, covering
about 550 km (340 miles). The Cotswold Way
was approved as a National Trail in 1998. A
new National Trail following the route of
Hadrian’s Wall will be ready in 2002. In
321
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Wales, Glyndwr’s Way (a roughly circular
route in Powys), and in Scotland a new Great
Glen Way, are at an advanced stage of
planning.
Horseriding and cycling in the countryside
are also encouraged, for example on the
Pennine Bridleway (currently being extended)
and the National Cycle Network (see p. 366).
About 22% of the rights of way in England
may be lawfully used by horseriders and
cyclists.
In May 1999 the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) published a
series of new guides giving details of more
than 1,500 farmland walks for the public
created under its agri-environment
schemes (see p. 455). The walks are listed
in county-by-county registers, which are
available free of charge from MAFF,
libraries and tourist information offices;
and on the Internet as a regularly updated
Conservation Walks Register
(www.countrywalks.org.uk).
Common land totals more than 550,000
hectares (1.4 million acres) in England and
Wales. Only one-fifth of common land has a
right of public access, although the open
character of commons has made them popular
for informal recreation. Four-fifths of
common land is privately owned, but people
other than the owner may have rights over it,
for example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law and ministerial consent is
usually required to undertake works on them.
There is no common land in Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
There is currently no automatic right of
public access to open country in England and
Wales, where local authorities can secure access
by means of agreements with landowners. If
agreements cannot be reached, authorities may
acquire land or make orders for public access.
Similar powers cover Scotland and Northern
Ireland; in Northern Ireland, the primary
responsibility lies with district councils. In
Scotland, there is a tradition of freedom to
roam, based on tolerance between landowners
and those seeking reasonable recreational access
to the hills.
In March 1999, the Government
announced its intention to introduce laws, as
soon as parliamentary time allows, to give
walkers a new right to explore the open
countryside. The new statutory right of access
would apply to mountain, moor, heath, down
and registered common land (about 1.6
million hectares or 4 million acres), and may
be extended to other types of open country
such as some woodland. It would not apply to
any developed land or agricultural land except
that used for rough grazing. The right would
be coupled with clear responsibilities for
walkers to respect the rights of landowners
and managers. New local access forums would
bring together farmers, landowners and
conservationists, to agree how improved
access should be managed. The provisions for
access to enclosed farmland under some agri¬
environment schemes, such as
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (see p. 455),
are also under review.
In Scotland, legislation is to be introduced
into the first session of the Scottish Parliament
to establish a statutory right of access,
exercised responsibly, to all land and inland
water for the purposes of informal recreation
and passage.
The Countryside Agency is completing a
programme to establish at least 250 new
Millennium Greens in and on the edge of
cities, towns, villages and hamlets across
England to mark the year 2000. The
programme has been aided by a £10
million Lottery grant from the Millennium
Commission. By September 1999, 251
communities had been offered grants to
help them prepare their plans, acquire
their land and begin to create their local
Millennium Green.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The policy for the protection of the
coastline against erosion and flooding is

administered by MAFF (for England), the
National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish
Executive and the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland. Operational
responsibility lies with local authorities and
the Environment Agency (see p. 330).
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. Jointly with local
authorities, the countryside agencies have
designated 45 Heritage Coasts, protecting
1,540 km (960 miles), about 35% of the total
length of coastline.
The National Trust (see p. 329), through
its Neptune Coastline Campaign, raises funds
to acquire and protect stretches of coastline of
great natural beauty and recreational value.
About £32 million has been raised since 1965
and the Trust now protects around 940 km
(600 miles) of coastline in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The National Trust for
Scotland owns large parts of the Scottish
coastline and protects others through
conservation agreements.
English Nature has supported 13 groups in
developing and managing a variety of marine
conservation initiatives. So far, 36 estuary
management plans have been completed or are
in preparation, covering 39 estuaries or 85%
of England’s total estuaries by area. (The Dee
and Severn estuary plans were jointly funded
with the CCW.) There are also 29 informal
marine consultation areas in Scotland. In
addition, SNH has established the Focus on
Firths initiative to co-ordinate management of
the main Scottish estuaries. In Wales the
CCW provides grant-in-aid to the Arfordir (or
Coastal) Group, which is concerned with the
sustainable management of the whole coast of
Wales. Altogether there are 163 estuaries in
the UK, representing about 30% of the North
Sea and Atlantic seaboard of Western Europe.
The UK also has about 75% of the European
chalk coast.
Wildlife Protection
The UK has about 96,000 separate species,
out of a global total of nearly 1.8 million. The
principal legislation protecting wildlife in
Great Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981 (as amended). This extended the list
of protected species; restricted the
introduction into the countryside of animals
not normally found in the wild in the UK;
afforded greater protection for SSSIs (see
p. 324) than previously; and made provision
for Marine Nature Reserves.
The list of protected species is reviewed by
the three statutory nature conservation
agencies, acting jointly through the JNCC,
every five years, when recommended changes
can be submitted to the Government. In 1998

a further 28 species of flora and fauna were
added to the list of protected species.
Farming practices are an important factor
in environmental considerations, as
agriculture dominates land use in Britain.
Some of the UK’s schemes which encourage
environmentally beneficial farming practices
are described in chapter 27 (pp. 455—6).
MAFF is also developing a group of indicators
of‘sustainable agriculture’, in order to help
monitor the impact of farming on the
environment and the rural economy.
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)
By the end of July 1999, 6,474 SSSIs had been
notified in Great Britain for their (often rare)
plant, animal, geological or physiographical
features. Some are of international importance
and have been designated for protection under
the European Commission (EC) Birds and
Habitats Directives or the Ramsar Convention
on Wetlands of International Importance.
Most are privately owned.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH have
powers to enter into land management
agreements with owners and occupiers of
SSSI land, where this is necessary, to
safeguard the sites from damaging operations,
and to support the management of their
natural features. The Northern Ireland
Council for Nature Conservation and the
Countryside advises the Government on
nature conservation matters, including the
establishment and management of land and
marine nature reserves and the declaration of
Areas of Special Scientific Interest.
Following public concern that the current
legislation and practice affecting SSSIs does
not provide adequate safeguards against
neglect and damage (including damaging
development), the Government is proposing to
introduce reforms that would give them
greater protection and improve their
management. These reforms would include an
obligation to take full consideration of
environmental effects in planning policy,
changing the rules for new road schemes, and
employing more conservation officers to
develop relationships with owners/occupiers
of SSSIs and improve site management.
Proposed legislation would also provide greater
powers to prevent damage and counter neglect.
Wildlife Trusts (based on conurbations,
counties or regions), the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Scottish
Wildlife Trust play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout the UK, and
between them have established over 2,000
reserves. The Trusts are affiliated to a parent

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Habitats: Recent Developments
• Hedgerows, which are vitally
important corridors for wildlife on
farmland, have been declining at the
rate of about 4% a year, largely
through removal. In March 1999 the
Government announced that, as part
of its drive to protect field
boundaries, walls and hedges—of a
length sufficient to surround the
British Isles—are being built,
renovated, replanted and maintained
under the Countryside Stewardship
scheme (see p. 455).
• World Wetlands Day, on 2 February
1999, marked the 28th anniversary of
the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands
of International Importance,
especially as habitats for waterfowl.
The UK had established 137 Ramsar
sites covering 649,000 hectares (1.6
million acres) by early 1999.
• Between 1992 and 1997, over 4% of
England’s ancient meadows and
grasslands were lost to development
and changes in agricultural practices.
The Meadowlands Partnership,
which manages meadowland sites
from Cornwall to the Isle of Arran, is
supplying seed gathered from its
meadows to farmers and developers
to re-create grassland in areas under
conservation or agri-environment
schemes, and around roadsides and
new developments.
• Ordnance Survey maps of 1880
recorded about 800,000 ponds—
bigger than about 20 feet across—in
England and Wales. Three-quarters
of these have now disappeared,
together with the wildlife that relies
on them. In March 1999 the Ponds
Conservation Trust, which has the
backing of English Nature and the
Environment Agency among others,
launched an initiative to restore 2,000
sites in the next four years.
organisation, ‘RSNC The Wildlife Trusts’.
The RSPB is the largest voluntary wildlife
conservation body in Europe, with just over
1 million members.
The Partnership for Action Against
Wildlife Crime includes representatives of
many statutory and voluntary bodies involved
in enforcing wildlife controls. It provides a
strategic overview of wildlife law enforcement
issues. Wildlife crime takes many forms and
has been increasing in recent years: for
example, theft of eggs from birds of prey,
illegal shooting, trapping, poisoning, digging
up of wild plants, and the illicit trade in
endangered species. DNA testing is playing an
increasing role in combating crime of this kind,
and there are now specialist wildlife officers in
almost every police force in the UK.
The UK is a party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which strictly
regulates trade in endangered species by means
of a permit system. The UK continues to play
a leading role in CITES and since 1997 has
been the Chair of the Standing Committee.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out, principally by the three nature
conservation agencies, to encourage the
recovery of populations of species threatened
with extinction in the UK. Species recovery
programmes form part of the UK’s
Biodiversity Action Plan (see p. 317).
Individual Action Plans cover a large number
of plants and animals in need of conservation
action, including some which are close to
extinction.
While some well-known species, such as
the skylark and red squirrel, are still declining,
others like the otter and red kite are
recovering. In the past year, the rarest frog in
the UK, the European pool frog, has been
found in a suburban garden; the glutinous
snail, believed to be extinct, has turned up in
north Wales; and a rare fish, the allis shad, has
been caught in the river Tamar, 121 years
after it was last recorded in Cornwall.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see
p. 441) has been successful for many years

with reintroduction projects. Its new
Millennium Seed Bank will hold seeds of all
1,442 native UK wildflowers, plants and trees
by the end of 1999, together with 10% of
flowering plants from the arid regions of the
world by 2010, and 25% by 2025. The Royal
Botanic Garden in Edinburgh (see p. 441)
promotes conservation programmes for rare
plants in Scotland and for coniferous trees
worldwide, maintaining genetically diverse
populations in cultivation at many sites as
pools for eventual reintroduction to the wild.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands.
Once a tree is protected, it is, in general, an
offence to cut down or reshape it without
permission. Courts can impose substantial
fines for breaches of such orders. Where
protected trees are felled in contravention of
an order or are removed because they are
dying, dead or dangerous, replacement trees
must be planted. Local authorities have
powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes, including the Forestry
Commission’s Woodland Grant Scheme, and
the planting of broadleaved trees has greatly
increased since the 1980s. Major afforestation
projects involving the DETR and the
Countryside Agency include the creation of 12
Community Forests in and around major
cities, covering 450,000 hectares (1.1 million
acres). The aim of these forests is to increase
woodland cover near the cities from 6.5% to
about 30%; restore areas scarred by industrial
dereliction; create sites for recreation, sport
and environmental education; and form new
habitats for wildlife. A separate National
Forest is taking shape in the English Midlands
(see p. 465), and the Central Scotland Forest
is also being developed. In Wales the Amman
Gwendraeth initiative is creating new
woodlands in the Welsh valleys.
The Woodland Trust is a voluntary body
which protects existing woods, and plants new
areas of woodland. It owns woods across the
UK covering about 17,000 hectares (42,000
acres) and, since it was founded in 1972, has
planted over 2 million trees. It acquires woods
at the rate of about one a week, and gained
ownership of its 1,000th wood by the end of
May 1999.
International Action
The UK’s international obligations to conserve
wildlife include membership of the World
Conservation Union and of several international
Conventions. Under the EC Habitats Directive,
333 sites in Britain have been put forward as
candidate Special Areas of Conservation
(SACs). Together with Special Protection Areas
(SPAs), classified under the EC Wild Birds
Directive, SACs will form a network of
protected sites across the European Union (EU)
known as Natura 2000. In March 1999 an area
of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, attractive to the
threatened corncrake, became the 100th site in
Scotland to be classified as an SPA.
The UK is party to the Ramsar
Convention, whose objectives are to stem the
progressive encroachment on, and loss of,
wetlands, and to promote their wise use. In
addition to the 137 Ramsar sites in the UK
itself, there are ten sites in the British
Overseas Territories: seven in Bermuda and
one each in the British Virgin Islands, the
Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos
Islands. A further 30 sites have been identified
as candidate Ramsar sites in the British
Overseas Territories and two in the Crown
Dependencies.
The Darwin Initiative forms part of the
measures announced by the UK at the 1992
‘Earth Summit’ (see p. 311). It makes British
experience, expertise and financial support
available to developing countries with
important biological resources, to help them
with the conservation and sustainable use of
their species. A committee of experts advises
the Government on the Initiative, which
receives funding of £3 million a year. Nearly
200 projects have been funded so far, and the
latest round of 26 projects, announced in
March 1999, includes: a research project to
conserve western lowland gorillas in Gabon; a
study of the conservation of coastal
vegetation in Lebanon; and a pilot project to
maintain a sustainable waste management

plan for a hotel and village on a coral reef in
Fiji.
Among other international projects
supported financially by the UK in 1998-99
were:
• the 21st Century Tiger Initiative;
• the Global Tiger Forum;
• measures to conserve the African
elephant;
• the Regional Seas Trust Fund to help
protect the world’s oceans;
• conservation of coral reefs in South Asia;
and
• research into seahorse conservation.
The Environmental Know How Fund, an
aim of which is to help the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe improve their
environment, has approved over 350 projects
since 1992, with funding of £13 million. A
further £8 million is planned for 1999-2000.
Buildings and Monuments
In England lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are compiled
by DCMS with the advice of English
Heritage.1 In Scotland and Wales buildings
are listed by Historic Scotland and Cadw:
Welsh Historic Monuments. It is against the
law to demolish, extend or alter the character
of any ‘listed’ building without prior consent
from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State, Scottish
minister or National Assembly secretary in
Wales. A local planning authority can issue a
‘building preservation notice’ to protect for six
months an unlisted building which it
considers to be of special architectural or
historic interest and is at risk, while a decision
is taken on whether it should be listed. In
Northern Ireland historic buildings are listed
by the Department of the Environment
(DOENI) on the recommendation of the EHS
1 In April 1999 English Heritage and the Royal Commission
on Historical Monuments of England were administratively
merged to form a single new organisation, called English
Heritage, with lead responsibility for the built heritage in
England.
following consultation with the advisory
Historic Buildings Council (HBC).
Ancient monuments are protected through
a system of scheduling. English Heritage is
assessing all known archaeological sites in
England, in order to identify which (out of
some 600,000 sites) should be afforded
statutory protection. Similar efforts are being
made to identify buildings and ancient and
historic monuments eligible for statutory
protection in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
In England details of all listed buildings are
contained in about 2,000 volumes which can
be inspected at the English Heritage offices in
Swindon (National Monuments Record
Centre) and London. The lists for particular
areas are also held by the relevant local
planning authorities, where they are available
for inspection, and at some public libraries.
EHS’s Monuments and Buildings Record in
Belfast holds information on all historic
monuments and buildings in Northern
Ireland.
Photographs of all the historic listed
buildings of England are to be put on the
National Monuments Record’s Images of
England Internet website
(www.imagesofengland.org.uk), with the
help of a £3.1 million Millennium Festival
grant. The website, which will be the
largest free on-line picture library in the
world, is due for completion in 2002.
Among England’s more unusual listed
sites are 52 garden sheds, 499 pigsties, 277
lavatories, 2,221 telephone boxes, eight
skating rinks and one racing pigeon loft.

English Heritage is responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 409
historic properties in public ownership or
guardianship, and gives grants for the repair of
ancient monuments and historic buildings in
England. Most of its properties are open to the
public, and there were nearly 5.8 million
visitors to its staffed properties alone in
1998-99. Government funding for English
Heritage is £115 million in 1999-2000.

Cadw, with 130, perform similar functions.
There were 3 million visitors to Historic
Scotland’s staffed properties in 1998-99. An
Ancient Monuments Board and an HBC
advise the Scottish Ministers. T he DOENI
has 182 historic monuments in its care,
managed by the EHS (another 1,365 are
scheduled). It is also advised by a Historic
Monuments Council.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 9,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 482 in Wales, 602 in Scotland and 53
in Northern Ireland. These areas receive
additional protection through the planning
system, particularly over the proposed
demolition of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are of importance to the
national heritage. The Fund is also used for
distributing the heritage share of the proceeds
from the National Lottery (see p. 121). By
June 1999, over £\.3 billion had been
awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund for
2,834 projects.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, and Historic
Scotland. Historic Royal Palaces and the
Royal Parks Agency carry out this function
on behalf of the Secretary of State in
England.
In summer 1999 a Commission for
Architecture and the Built Environment
came into being. Its main remit is to
promote the importance, benefit and
understanding of high-quality architecture
and urban design in villages, towns and
cities, and to act as a ‘national champion’
for architecture.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
As the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, the UK has a
rich industrial heritage, including such sites as
the Ironbridge Gorge, where Abraham Darby
(1677-1717) first smelted iron using coke
instead of charcoal (now a World Heritage
Site—see p. 329). Many other museums
devoted to the preservation of industrial
buildings and equipment have been set up,
such as the National Coal Mining Museum at
the former Caphouse Colliery near Wakefield
and the Carrickfergus Gasworks Museum.
Several industrial monuments in Scotland
are in the care of the First Minister, including
Bonawe Iron Furnace, the most complete
charcoal-fuelled ironworks surviving in
Britain; the working New Abbey Corn Mill;
and Dallas Dhu Malt Whisky Distillery.
The UK pioneered railways, and has a fine
heritage of railway buildings and structures. A
large number of disused railway lines have been
bought by railway preservation societies, and
several railway museums have been established.
328
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Reminders of the UK’s maritime past are
also preserved. Portsmouth is home to HMS
Victory (Admiral Nelson’s flagship), HMS
Warrior (the world’s first iron battleship,
launched in 1860), and the remains of King
Henry VIII’s Mary Rose, the world’s only
surviving 16th-century warship.
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust,
preserves vessels and other maritime items of
historic or technical interest. The Trust’s
vessels include the clipper Cutty Sark
(launched in 1869) at Greenwich, in London.
In all, about 400 historic ships are preserved in
the UK, mostly in private hands.
World Heritage Sites
The UK has 17 sites in the World Heritage
List, which was established under the 1972
World Heritage Convention to identify and
secure lasting protection for sites of
outstanding universal value:
• Canterbury Cathedral (begun in 1070),
with St Augustine’s Abbey and St
Martin’s Church, in Kent;
Durham Cathedral (begun in 1093) and
Castle;
Studley Royal Gardens (18th century)
and Fountains Abbey (founded in 1132),
in North Yorkshire;
Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge (1779) and other early
industrial sites, in Shropshire;
the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
Blenheim Palace (early 18th century), in
Oxfordshire;
the Palladian city of Bath, in north-east
Somerset;
Hadrian’s Wall, the former Roman
frontier in northern England;
the Tower of London (begun in the 11th
century);
the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster;
Maritime Greenwich, also in London;
the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
Edinburgh Old and New Towns;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I (1272-1307), in north Wales;
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland; and
• two natural sites in the UK’s Overseas
Territories (see p. 77)—Gough Island
(part of Tristan da Cunha) in the South
Atlantic, and Henderson Island in the
South Pacific.
The UK, which is seeking election in 1999
to become one of the 21 members of the
World Heritage Committee, has nominated 25
new sites for World Heritage status, including
two that will be formally nominated in 1999:
Bleanavon Industrial Landscape in south
Wales and the town of St George in Bermuda.
The Voluntary Sector
Voluntary organisations are well represented
in conservation work (over 2,000 are involved
with natural history and nature conservation
alone). Although they are funded largely by
subscription, private donations and entrance
fees, many receive government support and
grants, sometimes in recognition of statutory
responsibilities that they perform.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with
about 2.6 million members, owns and protects
over 300 properties open to the public, in
addition to 270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) of
land in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It looks after historic houses and gardens,
ancient monuments and archaeological
remains, forests, woods, fens, farmland,
downs, moorland, islands, nature reserves and
villages. The separate National Trust for
Scotland owns 125 properties and 75,000
hectares (185,000 acres) of countryside.
Pollution Control
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. The central
administration makes policy, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
329
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
authorities on policy implementation. In
England, the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on pollution control.
Similar responsibilities are exercised in
Scotland by the Minister for Transport and
the Environment, in Wales by the National
Assembly Environment Secretary and in
Northern Ireland by the DOENI.
Local authorities also have important duties
and powers. They are responsible for:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clear of litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
premises and, in England and Wales,
from many industrial premises;
• review, assessment and management of
local air quality; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The Environment Agency for England and
Wales and the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency (SEPA) regulate the major
pollution risks to air, water and land, and
waste. In Northern Ireland, the EHS exercises
similar functions.
There is an extensive framework of national
and EC legislation on the manufacture,
distribution, use and disposal of hazardous
chemicals. New and existing chemicals placed
on the market are subject to notification and
assessment procedures under EC legislation.
Pesticides, biocides and veterinary medicines
are subject to mandatory approval procedures.
International controls on the movement of
hazardous waste were further strengthened
under the Basel Convention in November
1998.
An independent standing body, the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution,
advises the Government. It has produced 21
reports so far on a variety of topics; the next,
on energy and the environment, is due for
completion by the end of 1999.
In 1999 the Environment Agency published
league tables of the companies which had
received the largest aggregate fines for
pollution in the previous year. In all, the
Agency conducted 744 prosecutions during
1998, but the largest fine so far—for £4.8
million (including legal costs)—was imposed
in January 1999 on the Milford Haven Port
Authority, following the Sea Empress oil spill
in 1996 that temporarily devastated fishing,
wildlife and tourism in west Wales.
Industrial Pollution Control
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
established two pollution control systems for
Great Britain: Local Air Pollution Control
(LAPC) and Integrated Pollution Control
(IPC), which both take account of releases to
air, land and water.
In England and Wales LAPC is operated by
local authorities and IPC by the Environment
Agency. In Scotland SEPA operates both IPC
and LAPC. In Northern Ireland the EHS
exercises broadly similar controls, and a
system similar to IPC was introduced in 1998.
A new, but similar, Pollution Prevention
and Control (PPC) regime, implementing an
EC Directive on Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control (IPPC), is to be
phased in during 2000-07, to succeed IPC and
LAPC. Regulators will be required, by prior
authorisation, to ensure minimum pollution
from industry through use of best available
techniques, subject to assessment of costs and
benefits. Both systems require regulators to
take account of the special characteristics of an
installation and its local environment.
Under PPC, integrated authorisations will
apply to a larger number of industrial
activities. These include, for example, animal
rendering, currently regulated under LAPC,
as well as some, such as food and drink and
intensive livestock, which hitherto have not
been controlled. Regulators will also be
required to take a wider range of
environmental impacts (including noise,
energy efficiency and site restoration) into
account when issuing integrated permits.
Those LAPC installations not covered by the
IPPC Directive will continue to have
emissions to air only regulated under PPC.
Installations will be phased into the new
system on a sectoral basis. Regulators will,
with some exceptions, continue to be
responsible for those installations they
currently regulate under IPC and LAPC.
330
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Local authorities will therefore be responsible
for some integrated permits. In Scotland
SEPA will continue to regulate all installations
falling within the regime.
In May 1999 the Environment Agency
launched a Pollution Inventory, which
provides details of emissions to air, water and
land from processes regulated under IPC, and
their contributions to national emission levels.
An advisory committee, with representatives
from industry, government, and non¬
governmental organisations such as Friends of
the Earth, has been set up to help the Agency
in the Inventory’s development, including
information about other processes it regulates,
such as landfill and sewage treatment works.
Land, Waste and Litter
Soil quality in the UK is relatively good, but
with some localised erosion and loss of soil,
and areas of contamination, natural and man¬
made. The Government is preparing a draft
soil strategy for England, to promote the
sustainable use of soil and to raise public
awareness of the importance of this. The UK’s
legacy of contaminated land results from an
industrial age that generated wealth but also
caused much pollution.
In most cases redevelopment is considered
the best solution for contaminated land,
which can be brought back into safe and
beneficial use for new buildings and open
spaces. Where current use causes a problem,
local authorities and the Environment Agency
have powers to take action. A new,
strengthened, regulatory regime for dealing
with contaminated land is to come into force
in England early in 2000.
Local authorities in England and Wales are
responsible for the collection and disposal of
all household waste and some commercial
waste. In two-tier areas district councils are
responsible for waste collection and county
councils for waste disposal, while in unitary
areas the council has both roles. In Scotland
local authorities carry out both roles and waste
regulation rests with SEPA, while in Northern
Ireland responsibility for waste regulation is
being transferred from district councils to the
DOENI.
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
and the Waste Management Licensing
Regulations 1994 regulate waste management.
Anyone who deposits, recovers or disposes of
controlled waste must comply with the
conditions of a waste management licence (or
with the terms of an exemption from
licensing), in a way that does not pollute the
environment or harm human health.
‘Controlled waste’ means household,
commercial or industrial waste, and those who
produce, import, carry, keep, treat or dispose
of it have a duty of care to ensure that it is
properly managed, recovered and disposed of
safely, and is transferred only to those
authorised to receive it. ‘Special’ (hazardous)
wastes are subject to additional controls
related to their transport and movement.
Policies on waste shipment into and out of the
UK are under review.
Final disposal, generally through landfill,
makes little practical use of waste. The
Government is committed to reducing
reliance on landfill and in 1999 increased the
standard rate of landfill tax from £7 to £10 a
tonne, with a further rise of £1 a tonne a year
until at least 2004, to encourage less waste and
more recycling. An EC Directive, which
introduces progressive targets to reduce the
amount of biodegradable municipal waste
going to landfill and tightens EC landfill
regulations, has been agreed.
In late 1999 the Government plans to
publish a Waste Strategy for England and
Wales, to show how waste will be managed
during the next 20 years; the Scottish
National Waste Strategy will also be
published. Northern Ireland will have a
separate strategy.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The reclamation and recycling of waste
materials are encouraged whenever these are
the best practicable environmental option.
Local authorities are obliged to make plans for
the recycling of waste. However, just 8% of
municipal waste in England and Wales was
recycled in 1997-98. The Government
recognises that substantial increases in
recycling, composting and energy recovery
331
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
from waste (by incineration) are needed, and
this will be incorporated in the new waste
strategy for England and Wales.
Under the EC Directive on packaging and
packaging waste, at least 50% of the UK’s
packaging waste must be recovered and at
least 25% recycled by the year 2001. New
regulations that came into force in 1998 in
Great Britain and in 1999 in Northern Ireland
stipulate that all packaging must be
‘recoverable’ through at least one of the
following: recycling; incineration with energy
recovery; or composting or biodegradation.
The general public can deposit used glass
containers in bottle banks for recycling. In
1998 there were some 22,000 bottle bank sites
in the UK and over 5,000 steel can banks. In
1996 there were over 9,000 can banks accepting
aluminium cans and 700 cash-for-cans centres.
A variety of other materials, such as textiles,
paper and plastics, are also recycled. One of the
Government’s waste goals is for a third of
household waste to be recycled by 2015.
Another is that 30% of household waste
should be recycled or composted by 2010.
Litter and Dog Fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum fine upon successful prosecution is
£2,500. The optional litter fixed penalty fine,
which discharges a person’s liability to
prosecution, is £25.
Local authorities have a duty to keep their
public land free of litter and refuse, including
dog faeces, as far as is practicable. Members of
the public have powers to take action against
authorities which fail to comply with their
responsibilities. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland local authorities also have
powers to make it an offence not to clear up
after one’s dog in specified places, and may
issue a fixed penalty fine of £25 under the
Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996. In Scotland
it is an offence to allow a dog to foul in
specified places.
The Tidy Britain Group is the national
agency for tackling litter, in collaboration with
local authorities and the private sector. Its
1999 month-long National Spring Clean
campaign involved 2.9 million people who
collected 14,500 tonnes of litter.
The environment agencies, local
authorities, police and the Tidy Britain Group
have been monitoring the incidence of‘fly
tipping’ (illegal dumping of waste) since the
introduction of the landfill tax (see p. 331).
There has been an increase since 1994—95, but
not as great as originally feared. The
maximum penalty for fly tipping (and other
offences relating to waste) is up to five years’
imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. The
Environment Agency and SEPA provide a
free 24-hour hotline in the UK (0800 807060)
which the public can use to report incidents.
Water
In the UK 96% of the population live in
properties connected to a sewer, and sewage
treatment works serve over 80%. In England
and Wales the water industry is planning an
investment programme of some £7 billion
during the period 2000 to 2005 for
improvements to water quality. Progressively
higher treatment standards for industrial
waste effluents and new measures to combat
pollution from agriculture are expected to
bring further improvements in water quality.
In Scotland responsibility for the provision
of all water and sewerage services lies with
three Water Authorities, covering the north,
east and west of the country. For details on
the water supply industry and the Drinking
Water Inspectorate, see pp. 503-5.
All discharges to water in the UK require
the consent of the appropriate regulatory
authority. In England and Wales the
Environment Agency’s principal method of
controlling water pollution is through the
regulation of all effluent discharges, including
sewage, into controlled waters (groundwaters,
inland and coastal waters). The Agency
maintains public registers containing
information about water quality, discharge
consents, authorisations and monitoring.
Applicants for consents to discharge have the
right of appeal if they are dissatisfied with the
Agency’s decision; most of these appeals are
dealt with by the Planning Inspectorate, an
executive agency of the DE4 R. In Scotland
control is the responsibility of SEPA, and

The Environment Agency reported 17,863
substantiated water pollution incidents in
1998, of which 3,600 were industrial. The
biggest polluter was the construction industry,
with 625 incidents.
In 1997 and 1998 the Government
introduced statutory Environmental Quality
Standards for 33 substances in the aquatic
environment, further implementing the EC
Dangerous Substances Directive. The new
regulations give legal force for the first time to
environmental quality standards for certain
dangerous substances under the Directive,
including arsenic, atrazine and simazine.
Among other chemicals causing concern are
‘endocrine disrupters’, which mimic
hormones, and persistent organic pollutants
(including some insecticides), on which the
UK is playing a leading role to secure a global
treaty by 2001. The Government intends to
publish a White Paper on the control of
chemicals in 1999.
There are 68 designated Nitrate Vulnerable
Zones (NVZs) in England and Wales covering
about 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres), one
in Scotland and three in Northern Ireland.
Their aim is to protect water against pollution
caused by nitrates used in fertilisers for
agriculture. Nitrates are essential for the
normal functioning of a healthy ecosystem,
but become pollutants if they are
overabundant; they are now the most
widespread pollutants in the western world.
Since December 1998 (June 1999 in Northern
Ireland) farmers in NVZs have been required
to keep formal records of their use of
fertilisers and organic manures so that the
restrictions on nitrates leaching into rivers and
groundwater can be monitored.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
The quality of UK bathing waters improved
slightly during 1998, with 89% of waters
meeting EC mandatory coliform bacteria
standards, compared with 88% in 1997 and
66% in 1988. The water industry is investing
around £2 billion to provide treatment of
coastal sewage discharges and improve the
quality of the UK’s bathing waters. There are
117 schemes, covering 198 bathing zones, to
improve sewage outfalls and overflow
arrangements, of which 102 were ready for the
1999 bathing season.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
A record 45 beaches in the UK were
awarded Europe’s ‘Blue Flag’ in 1998. This
fell to 41 in 1999, but the number of marinas
gaining the award rose from six to 26.2 Blue
Flag awards recognise the achievement of a
number of objectives, including meeting the
guideline standards of the EC Bathing Waters
Directive as well as excellent water quality,
beach cleanliness, dog control, wheelchair
access and the provision of life-saving
equipment and other facilities. However,
according to surveys by the Tidy Britain
Group and Beachwatch, many seaside resorts
are still let down by litter and badly
maintained beach lavatories. Even so, in 1999
the Tidy Britain Group gave Seaside Awards
to 260 beaches in the UK, for meeting
demanding standards of water quality and
beach management.
Marine Environment
The Second London Oceans Workshop, in
December 1998, emphasised that the two
greatest problems facing the oceans are
unsustainable exploitation of fisheries and
land-based sources of marine pollution. The
1998 Ministerial Meeting of the OSPAR
(Oslo-Paris) Convention—which covers
inputs and discharges of harmful substances,
from both land and sea, into the north-east
Atlantic—reached agreement on several
issues, including:
• the adoption of long-term strategies to
protect ecosystems and biodiversity, and
to guide work on hazardous substances,
radioactive substances and
eutrophication;3
• the end of the potential opt-out for
France and the UK on the dumping of
radioactive waste at sea; and
• a total ban on the dumping at sea of all
steel installations (see p. 492).

Europe as a whole.
3 In which aquatic life in a nutrient-rich environment is
killed by being deprived of oxygen as a result of the
decomposition of a dense plant population.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see
p. 373) is responsible for dealing with spillages
of oil or other hazardous substances from
ships at sea. The various counter-pollution
facilities for which it is responsible include:
remote-sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach
cleaning equipment. The Agency has an
Enforcement Unit at its headquarters in
Southampton for apprehending ships making
illegal discharges of oil and other pollutants off
the British coast. The maximum fine for
pollution from ships was raised to £250,000 in
1997.
Decisions about which areas of the UK
Continental Shelf should be made available for
petroleum licensing take account of advice
from the JNCC (see p. 320). Where areas are
made available for exploration and
development, special conditions may be
imposed on the licence holders to minimise or
avoid any impact on the marine environment.
These conditions are agreed with the JNCC.
The UK does not permit any deposit of
waste in the sea where there is a safe land-
based alternative unless it can be
demonstrated that disposal at sea is the best
practicable option. Under the OSPAR
Convention, the Government is working
towards achieving substantial reductions of
radioactive discharges to near background
values for naturally occurring substances and
close to zero for artificial substances. Disposal
of sewage sludge at sea ceased at the end of
1998. From 1999 the only types of waste that
will routinely be considered for deposit in the
sea will be dredged material from ports and
harbours, and small quantities of fish waste.
Air
Air quality in the UK has improved in the
past 40 years. However, although the dense
smoke-laden fogs, or ‘smogs’, that afflicted
London and other major cities in the 1950s
and 1960s have entirely disappeared, new
concerns have arisen, especially over emissions
from the growing number of motor vehicles,
which periodically produce ‘summertime
smogs’ and ‘wintertime smogs’. These can
334
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
consist of elevated levels of sulphur dioxide
(S02), nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone,
airborne particles (particulate matter—PM10)
and other pollutants. Measures have
consequently been adopted to reduce
emissions from road vehicles (see below).
Emissions of all the main air pollutants
continued to decline in 1997.
Industrial processes with the greatest
potential for producing harmful emissions are
subject to IPC (see p. 330). Processes with a
significant but lesser potential for air pollution
require approval, in England and Wales from
local authorities, in Scotland from SEPA and
in Northern Ireland from the EHS. Local
authorities also control emissions of black
smoke from commercial and industrial
premises, and implement smoke control areas
to deal with emissions from domestic
properties.
The UK National Air Quality Strategy, the
first of its kind in Europe, was published in
1997 and sets out air quality objectives for the
pollutants of main concern: nitrogen dioxide,
PM10, ground-level ozone, S02, carbon
monoxide, lead, benzene and 1,3-butadiene.
The target date for achieving the objectives is
2005. However, a rolling review is continually
reassessing the Strategy in the light of new
scientific evidence. The Government has
indicated that some of the objectives will be
made tougher and target dates brought
forward. Local authorities have a duty to
review and assess air quality in their areas and,
if the Strategy’s air quality objectives are
unlikely to be achieved by 2005 with the
measures they already have in place, to
designate Air Quality Management Areas and
produce remedial action plans.
The UK has an automatic air quality
monitoring network with sites covering much
of the country, in both urban and rural areas.
In recent years, this network has undergone a
rapid expansion, and it now has 108 sites.
Daily Air Quality Bulletins make air pollution
data from the monitoring network available to
the public. These give the concentrations of
the main pollutants, together with an air
pollution forecast. The information features in
television and radio weather reports, and
appears in many national and local
newspapers. Information, updated hourly
PM10 is among the most difficult
pollutants to control. Day-to-day changes
in PM 10 concentrations have been
associated with increases in hospital
admissions and deaths brought forward,
especially among the elderly and those
with advanced heart and lung disease. The
main sources of PM10 in the UK are road
traffic, other air pollutants such as S02
and nitrogen dioxide, and suspended soils,
dusts and sea salt.

Archive website (www.environment.detr.gov.
uk/airq.aqinfo.htm).
Vehicle Emissions
All new petrol-engined passenger cars in the
UK must be fitted with catalytic converters,
which typically reduce emissions by over
75%. Three EC Directives agreed during the
UK Presidency in 1998, and which will come
into force from January 2000, will further
improve emissions from passenger cars and
light commercial vehicles. The European
Commission has set further standards for both
car emissions and fuel quality, to be
introduced in 2005.
In December 1998 European environment
ministers reached agreement to cut pollution
from lorries and buses by 60%. As well as
reductions in oxides of nitrogen,
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, this
involves cutting emissions of particulate
matter by 30% by 2000 and by 86% by 2005.
Lorries and buses are responsible for 55% of
particulate transport emissions (and 39% of
oxides of nitrogen). The use of new
‘particulate traps’ will remove most of the
smallest particles, which pose the greatest
health risk.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
vehicles in use are a key element in the UK’s
strategy for improving air quality. Metered
emission tests and smoke checks feature in the
335

annual ‘MoT’ roadworthiness test (see
p. 364). Enforcement checks carried out at the
roadside or in operators’ premises also include
a check for excessive smoke. The Vehicle
Inspectorate (see p. 364) carried out 96,342
roadside emissions checks in 1998-99 (on
cars, coaches, lorries, buses and taxis) and
149,641 roadworthiness checks. Under a trial
scheme introduced in 1997, seven local
authorities were given powers to enforce
vehicle exhaust emissions standards by
random testing at the roadside, with a £60
fixed penalty fine for offenders causing
avoidable pollution.
The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force is
creating a partnership between government
and the private sector to promote the
development and marketing of
environmentally friendly vehicles (and fuels).
At the same time, the Government’s Foresight
Vehicle programme is promoting R&D in
cleaner vehicle technology (such as electric,
hybrid and fuel cell technologies), while its
Powershift programme aims to establish a
market for vehicles that use alternative fuels,
such as compressed natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas. By December 1998 Powershift
had helped to secure over £20 million worth
of orders for alternatively powered vehicles,
including 64 electric ones. For tax incentives
to encourage the use of cleaner fuels and
smaller cars, see p. 410.
Sales of unleaded petrol have risen from
virtually nothing in the mid-1980s to almost
79% of all petrol sold in 1998. In line with an
EC Directive, leaded petrol in the UK will be
withdrawn from general sale on 1 January
2000. Urban levels of lead have already fallen
to 0.2 micrograms per cubic metre at most—
that is, below the maximum level
recommended for health reasons.
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the ‘greenhouse’ effect. Emissions from
human activities are increasing the
atmospheric concentrations of several
important greenhouse gases, which in turn are
increasing the greenhouse effect and leading to
global warming and climate change. Easily the
most significant greenhouse gas in the UK is

carbon dioxide (C02—see charts above),
followed by methane and nitrous oxide. Some
other greenhouse gases, such as
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), have high global
warming potential but comparatively low
levels of emission, although these have been
rising.
Globally, 1998 was the hottest year since
instrument records began in 1860, and six out
of the last ten years have been the hottest on
record. Research at the Hadley Centre, part of
the Meteorological Office, is focused on
improving climate predictions and
investigating the cause of recent climate
change. Results from its latest climate model
suggest that, with current levels of increase in
greenhouse gases, the global mean sea level
will rise about 20 cm by the 2050s, and there
will be a rise in average global temperature of
up to 3°C over the next 100 years.
It is becoming increasingly important to
understand and predict the possible impacts of
climate change on the natural environment
and society, so that adaptation measures can
be planned. The Government has set up the
UK Climate Impacts Programme to allow
detailed assessments of the impacts to be
made, both at UK and regional levels. In

Britain there may be more droughts in the
south and east, more flooding in the north and
west, more damage as a result of storm surges,
threats to the coast and low-lying agricultural
land, and changes in wildlife and habitats.
International action on climate change
dates from the ‘Earth Summit’ in Rio in 1992
(see p. 312), where the Framework
Convention on Climate Change called for the
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level which would
prevent dangerous man-made interference
with the climate system. The UK is on course
to meet its Convention commitment to return
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. Emissions of C02 fell by 8%, and
the ‘basket’ of six gases by 9%, between 1990
and 1997. This achievement is the result of the
UK’s first Climate Change Programme,
published in 1994.
At the third Conference of the Parties to
the Framework Convention, held in Kyoto
(Japan) in 1997, developed countries agreed
legally binding targets to reduce emissions of
the six main greenhouse gases: C02, methane,
nitrous oxide, HFCs, perfluorocarbons
(PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride. The
Protocol committed developed nations to a
5.2% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
below 1990 levels by 2008-12. The EU agreed
to a collective reduction target of 8%.
In 1998 the EU decided how its 8% should
be shared out among member states. The
individual country targets range from a
reduction of 28% for Luxembourg to a
permitted increase of 27% for Portugal. The
UK’s target is a reduction of 12.5%, but the
Government is committed to moving beyond
that towards a domestic goal of reducing CCE
emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by the
year 2010.
Having consulted widely on the policy
options for meeting Britain’s Kyoto target and
moving towards the domestic goal, the
Government aims to publish a draft Climate
Change Programme in late 1999 for further
consultation, and a new programme in 2000.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
337
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. British
scientists first discovered ozone losses over
much of the globe, including a ‘hole’ in the
ozone layer over Antarctica, in 1985. Ozone
depletion is caused by man-made chemicals
containing chlorine or bromine, such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or halons, which
have been used in aerosol sprays, refrigerators
and fire extinguishers.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol deals with the
protection of the stratospheric ozone layer and
has been signed by over 160 countries. The
parties to the Protocol meet annually, and
major reviews every two to three years
progressively tighten the controls on ozone-
depleting substances. The UK is meeting its
obligations under both the Montreal Protocol
and subsequent EC Regulations which go
beyond the Protocol. For example,
consumption of CFCs was phased out in the
UK and EU by the end of 1994, one year
ahead of the Protocol, although it is still
allowed for a small number of essential uses,
such as asthma inhalers.
Developing countries have until 2010 to
phase out CFC consumption. A multilateral
fund has been established to help them
comply with controls on ozone-depleting
substances; the UK contributes towards this.
The Protocol has also placed controls on
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which
are transitional substances with much lower
ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. They
are needed in a number of areas to allow
industry to stop using CFCs more quickly,
but are to be phased out by 2030 in developed
countries. The EU has introduced even
tighter controls on HCFCs, requiring their
consumption to be phased out by 2015.
Methyl bromide, a pesticide, is also covered
by the Protocol; its production and
consumption must be phased out by 2005 in
developed countries and by 2015 in
developing countries.
The growing amount of ozone-depleting
substances in the stratosphere is still cause for
concern. However, provided that all countries
meet their obligations under the Montreal
Protocol, the ozone layer, though continuing
to suffer damage over the next few years, is
expected to recover gradually.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
S02 and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are the
main gases whose emissions lead to acid rain.
The principal sources are combustion plants
that burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations and, for NOx, road vehicles. The
damaging effect of high levels of acid
depositions from combustion processes on
freshwaters, trees, soils and buildings has been
demonstrated by scientific research. Lower
emissions of S02 over the past 25 years (see
graph on p. 336) have led to the first signs of a
decrease in acidification in some lochs in
south-west Scotland. However, although
emission controls are benefiting the
environment generally, the recovery of more
sensitive ecosystems has been slow.
Internationally, the UK is working with
both the UN and the EU to step up the fight
against acid rain. Britain’s ratification of the
Second Sulphur Protocol of the UN’s
Convention on Long Range Transboundary
Pollution commits it to an 80% reduction of
its 1980 sulphur emissions by 2010. (By the
end of 1997 it was 16% ahead of the
intermediate target of a 50% reduction by
2000.) The UK is currently involved in the
development of further international
agreements aimed at combating
acidification, eutrophication and ground-
level ozone. The proposed EC National
Emission Ceilings Directive and the UN
Multi-Pollutant Multi-Effect Protocol aim
to set national emission ceilings for 2010 for
S07, NOx, ammonia and volatile organic
compounds.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for ‘statutory nuisances’, including noise
nuisance from premises and vehicles,
machinery or equipment in the street. They
must take reasonable steps to investigate
complaints, and serve a noise abatement
notice where it is judged to be a statutory
nuisance. They can also designate noise
abatement zones, within which registered
levels of noise from certain premises may not
be increased without their permission. There
338
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
are specific provisions in law to control noise
from construction and demolition sites; to
control the use of loudspeakers in the streets;
and to enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
nuisance.
The Noise Act 1996 has strengthened the
law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
on action that can be taken against noisy
neighbours. For example, it clarifies the
procedures under which local authorities can
confiscate noise-making equipment, and
provides powers to make night noise treatable
as a separate offence. In addition, the Housing
Act 1996 has given local authorities new
powers to deal with anti-social behaviour by
tenants, including noise.
Compensation may be payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Highway authorities are required to make
grants available for the insulation of homes
when they are subject to specified levels of
increased noise caused by new or improved
roads. Equivalent regulations exist for
railways.
In England and Wales new noise mitigation
measures for trunk roads were introduced in
March 1999, including quieter surfaces for
new roads, an annual £5 million budget to
address problems on particularly noisy
existing trunk roads, and maintenance
resurfacing using new materials. A £700,000
research programme funded by the DETR
and supported by industry is aimed at
reducing the noise generated by vehicle tyres
in rolling over the road surface. (One use for
old vehicle tyres, which are themselves
difficult to dispose of satisfactorily, is to
recycle them in granulated form for road and
playground surfaces.)
Under international agreements, noisier
subsonic jet aircraft are due to be phased out
by 2002. Already around 85% of
UK-registered jets are the quieter ‘Chapter 3’
types. Various operational restrictions,
including at night, aim to reduce noise
disturbance at the UK’s major airports. The
Government has commissioned research on
the non-auditory health effects of aircraft
noise.
Every city in the EU with more than
250,000 inhabitants may be required to
draw up a ‘noise map’ of its streets by
2002, in response to a forthcoming
European Commission proposal for a
Directive on limiting pollution. According
to the Commission, about 80 million
people in the EU currently ‘suffer
unacceptable levels of continuous outdoor
transport noise’.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents about 15% of
what the population is exposed to; most occurs
naturally. A large proportion of the exposure
to man-made radiation comes from medical
uses, such as X-rays. This and other
man-made radiation is subject to stringent
control. Users of radioactive materials must be
registered by the Environment Agency in
England and Wales and its equivalents in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Authorisation
is also required for the accumulation and
disposal of radioactive waste. The Health and
Safety Executive (HSE—see p. 162) is
responsible for regulating safety at civil
nuclear installations. No such installation may
be constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the HSE.
International Commitments
Having already signed it, the UK is preparing
to ratify and implement the International Joint
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive
Waste Management. In 1998 members of the
OSPAR Convention, including the UK,
agreed to reduce radioactive discharges by
2000 to levels whereby the additional
concentrations of radioactive substances in the
marine environment are close to zero (see
p. 334).
Radon
In 1987 the first measures were announced to
deal with the problem, in certain parts of the
country, of radon, a naturally occurring
339
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
radioactive gas which can accumulate in
houses and which accounts for half of the total
average population radiation dose. Long-term
exposure to the gas can increase the risk of
lung cancer. In 1998-99 the Government
completed its programme of offering free
measurement of radon to all households in
Radon Affected Areas, and is now working
with local authorities to encourage building
works that reduce radon levels in homes.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Currently all radioactive waste in the UK is
either disposed of safely in suitable facilities
on land or stored pending such disposal. The
UK has not disposed of any solid radioactive
waste at sea since 1982.
The disposal of such waste is regulated by
law. Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature
and level of activity, and the methods of
disposal reflect this. Most solid low-level
waste, material of low radioactivity, is disposed
of at the shallow disposal facility at Drigg in
Cumbria. Some small quantities of very low-
level waste are disposed of at authorised
landfill sites. Intermediate-level waste is stored
at nuclear licensed sites, usually those sites
where it is generated. Most of the UK’s
inventory is at Sellafield in Cumbria. High-
level or heat-generating waste is stored in either
raw (liquid) or vitrified (glasslike) form. Once
vitrified it will be stored for at least 50 years to
allow it to cool to a safe temperature for
disposal.
In spring 1999 the House of Lords Select
Committee on Science and Technology
published a report on the management of
nuclear waste. It recommended that
underground disposal facilities for solid
radioactive waste sites should be built in
geologically stable areas of the UK, but that
waste should be retrievable if necessary. The
Committee also recommended that an
authoritative Commission should be set up to
oversee implementation of policy and to co¬
ordinate research, and that a disposal company
should be set up to design, construct, operate,
and monitor and eventually close underground
repositories. The roles of Nirex—the company
set up by the nuclear industry with agreement
of government to dispose of intermediate and
some low-level waste—should be subsumed by
the new organisations, and the Government’s
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory
Committee should be disbanded when the
Commission is set up. A two-year study to
identify the research strategy needed to make
progress with the disposal of high-level waste
and spent fuel is due to publish its findings.
The Government plans to publish a
consultation paper early in 2000 on the options
for the future management of radioactive waste.
Environmental Research
Several government departments—such as the
DETR, MAFF, the Department of Health
and the Scottish Executive—have substantial
environmental research programmes. In
1999-2000 the DETR will commission about
140 research contracts with a total value of
£19 million. An increasingly important area is
research into the environmental effects of
genetically modified crops and micro¬
organisms (see pp. 438 and 450).
Among the other organisations that carry
out environmental research are the
Meteorological Office (including the Hadley
Centre); the Environment Agency, whose
R&D grant-in-aid for 1999—2000 is £10.6
million; the Natural Resources Institute of the
University of Greenwich at Chatham (Kent);
and the Climatic Research Unit at the
University of East Anglia. Nearly 100 British
universities and colleges run courses on
environmental studies or natural resource
management; many also carry out research.
In addition to research funded directly by
SEPA and the EHS, the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental
Research also commissions research.
Most of the government-funded Research
Councils (see pp. 436-9) have a role in
environmental science research, but the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) is particularly important. It has a
Science Budget allocation of £176 million for
1999-2000, and about £44 million from other
sources. The NERC undertakes and supports
research and monitoring in the environmental
sciences (both life science and physical
340
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
science) and funds postgraduate training. Its
programmes cover five main issues:
biodiversity; environmental risks and hazards;
global change; natural resource management;
and pollution and waste.
British zoos play an important part in the
conservation of endangered species and the
promotion of biodiversity through public
education, research and breeding
programmes.

As the United Kingdom is a relatively densely populated country, there are
considerable pressures on the use of land to accommodate the rising
population and the demands of a growing economy. The Government aims to
create a fair and efficient land-use planning system that respects regional
differences and promotes sustainable, high-quality development.
The number of dwellings in the UK was estimated at 24.9 million in 1998.
Preliminary projections suggest that the number of households in England will
rise from 20.2 million in 1996 to 24.0 million in 2021. The Government is
seeking to encourage the use of brownfield sites, particularly in inner cities, to
promote urban regeneration, thereby minimising the use of greenfield land for
housing development and preserving the countryside as far as possible.
PLANNING
Land-use planning is the direct responsibility
of local authorities in Great Britain. The
Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions has overall
responsibility for the operation of the system
in England. In Wales, since 1 July 1999, it has
come under the control of the National
Assembly for Wales, while in Scotland,
planning was wholly devolved to the Scottish
Parliament from the same date. In Northern
Ireland, the Planning Service, an executive
agency within the Department of the
Environment (DOENI), is responsible for the
implementation of the Government’s policies
for town and country planning in consultation
with district councils.
In England the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) issues national planning policy
guidance on housing, transport, retail
development, sport and recreation facilities,
minerals and waste, and across planning as a
whole. Working with the Government Offices
for the Regions (GOs), it ensures that regional
planning guidance and local authorities’
development plans and decisions on planning
applications are consistent with national
policies. The Planning Inspectorate, an
342
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
executive agency acting on behalf of the
Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions in England and the
National Assembly for Wales, is responsible
for determining, and in some cases reporting
on, all planning and enforcement appeals and
holding inquiries into development plans. It
also deals with planning-related casework,
compulsory purchase orders and cases arising
from the Environmental Protection and Water
Acts. In 1998-99, 13,200 planning appeal cases
were determined. Regional planning guidance
(RPG) in England encourages individual local
authorities to co-operate regionally on issues
such as housing, transport, air quality, energy
and waste. It also complements the economic
strategies of the Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 11). A new planning policy
guidance note will introduce arrangements
bringing greater openness to the preparation of
RPG and increasing regional responsibility of
both the issues and their resolution. In general,
the responsibility for regional planning is
shifting from central government to local and
regional bodies.
In Wales, local planning authorities are
responsible for the day-to-day operation of the
planning system, including the determination
of planning applications and the preparation of
development plans. The National Assembly
for Wales works with, regulates and guides
local planning authorities in undertaking their
functions so as to achieve a proper balance
between the needs of conservation and
development, in a way which is consistent
with the principle of sustainable development.
Similar planning procedures operate in
Scotland. In Northern Ireland the Planning
Service is responsible for issuing planning
policy guidance across planning as a whole,
the determination of planning applications and
the preparation of development plans.
Development Plans
Development plans have a central role in
shaping patterns of change in an area, as
planning decisions must be made in
accordance with the development plan unless
‘material considerations’ indicate otherwise.
All local planning authorities in England
must prepare development plans in line with
Tough new planning guidance on opencast
coal mining in England came into force
from April 1999. This will ensure that
planning permission for new opencast coal
mining is only given where it is
environmentally acceptable or provides
overriding local benefits.
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Structure plans, produced by county councils
and unitary authorities (often on a joint basis),
set out broad strategic policies for the
development and use of land, and are in place
in all areas where they are required. Unitary
development plans (produced in the main by
London boroughs and metropolitan districts)
and area-wide local plans (produced by
districts and most unitary authorities) set out
more detailed land-use policies. At the end of
1998, 67% of these plans were in place, with a
target of 83% in place by the end of 1999 and
100% coverage being reached after 2000. The
DETR scrutinises all plans, with the aim of
ensuring that local plans do not conflict with
national policies and regional guidance, unless
justified by local circumstances, and that they
contain clear and effective policies. The plans
provide the main means of reconciling the
need to make adequate provision for
development with the need to protect the
environment.
In Wales, the National Assembly for Wales
requires local planning authorities to prepare
and maintain up-to-date and relevant
development plans. Authorities should have
unitary development plans in place by the end
of the year 2000. In Scotland, land-use planning
has been wholly devolved to the Scottish
Parliament. In the meantime, the emphasis is on
modernising the planning system: the Planning
Audit Unit has been examining how authorities
handle planning applications with a view to
improving performance and disseminating good
practice advice. In Northern Ireland, a
Development Plan Programme was put in place
in 1998 by the Planning Service. This
programme is reviewed and rolled forward
annually, and is designed to meet the
development planning needs of all districts.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Brownfield Land
Local councils in England will in future have
to consider reusing brownfield (that is,
previously developed) land as the first option
for housing development. A revised version of
the Government’s Planning Policy Guidance
note 3: Housing, published in March 1999,
emphasises the importance of making the best
use of previously developed urban land and
existing buildings, in order to achieve a
national target to raise the percentage of new
homes built on previously developed land to
60%. This will minimise the use of greenfield
sites, encourage urban regeneration and help
create more sustainable patterns of
development. The Guidance advises
developers and local authorities to place the
needs of people before cars in designing the
layout of residential developments. If
redeveloping sites is not possible, the next
most sustainable option is to extend urban
areas, making use of existing infrastructure
and public transport links.
New statistics of changes in land use in
England were published in December
1998. These show that, in 1996, 53% of
new dwellings were built on previously
developed land, compared with 49% in
1994. The Government has established the
framework of a National Land Use
Database which will provide a consistent
assessment of vacant previously developed
land that may be available for housing or
other developments. Preliminary results
from the database, published in May 1999,
show an estimate of 33,000 hectares of
previously developed vacant and derelict
land in total. Some 4,800 hectares of this
land was allocated in local plans or had
planning permission for housing, about
4,500 hectares for mixed use and around
13,400 hectares for other uses. In total, just
over 12,000 hectares of vacant and derelict
land either had planning permission, were
allocated in the local plan for housing or
were judged suitable for housing.
Not all greenfield development will be
rejected; some will be necessary to
accommodate housing growth. Where this is so,
the Government again prefers extending existing
urban areas—and redrawing Green Belts (see
below) in exceptional circumstances—to new
settlements, such as those proposed at Grazeley
in Berkshire, Micheldever in Hampshire and
Broadclyst in Devon. Builders will no longer be
allowed to develop homes at very low densities
of up to 20 or 25 dwellings per hectare, as in
some of the recent large-scale developments, for
example, Milton Keynes. However, the
Guidance says that there will be no return to the
tower blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s, and
instead suggests a preference for terraced houses
with gardens, and town houses that use
communal open space, with a new maximum
standard for car parking, possibly 1 'A to 2 spaces
per dwelling.
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land intended to be left
open and protected from inappropriate
development. They aim to check the sprawl of
large built-up areas, safeguard surrounding
countryside from encroachment, prevent
neighbouring towns from merging, preserve the
special character of historic towns, and assist in
urban regeneration by encouraging the reuse of
derelict and other urban land. The first major
Green Belt established was around the fringes
of Greater London, under the London and
Home Counties Green Belt Act 1938.
Green Belts have been established around
other major cities and conurbations, including
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Greater
Manchester, Merseyside, and the West
Midlands, as well as several smaller towns. In
England, some 1.5 million hectares (3.8
million acres) have been designated as Green
Belt, while in Scotland there are six Green
Belt areas, totalling 156,600 hectares. There
are no Green Belts at present in Wales, but
creation of some is under consideration. Great
importance is attached to the protection of
Green Belts, and development on them is only
allowed in exceptional circumstances.
Development Control
Most development requires specific planning
permission. Applications are dealt with on the
344
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
basis of development plans and other relevant
planning considerations. In 1997-98, in
England, there were some 462,000 district
planning authority applications determined
out of a total of 505,000 applications received,
of which 62% were decided within eight
weeks (the target being 80%). In Scotland,
around 42,000 applications are received each
year, of which about 65% are determined
within two months. There is a target of 80%
of cases called in to be decided within two
months, and the remainder within three
months. In Northern Ireland, some 20,000
planning applications were received in
1998-99 and 18,500 decisions made. Targets
set are for 70% of minor and major
applications to be taken to district council
consultation within eight weeks.
Applicants have a right of appeal to the
Secretary of State in England, the National
Assembly for Wales and Scottish ministers in
Scotland if a local authority refuses planning
permission, grants it with conditions attached,
or fails to decide an application within eight
weeks or, in Scotland, two months.
Occasionally the appropriate minister can ‘call
in’ an application for their own determination.
A small number of cases end up as public
inquiries. Some categories of planning
application have to be notified to the
appropriate ministerial authority in certain
circumstances; for example, those involving a
significant departure from the approved
development plan. In Scotland, the
determination of the majority of planning
appeals is delegated to the Scottish Executive
Inquiry Reporters Unit, which is responsible
for organising public local inquiries into
planning proposals and related matters. In
Northern Ireland, appeals are determined by
the Planning Appeals Commission, which is
also responsible for holding public local
inquiries.
Unnecessarily long planning inquiries that
last for months or even years, such as that for
the fifth terminal at London’s Heathrow
Airport, could end under government
proposals put forward in a consultation paper
issued in May 1999. The purpose of the
proposals is to achieve significant
improvements in the time taken to handle
major projects, while continuing to ensure that
adequate opportunity is given for people to
have a say, test the evidence and reach a sound
decision. The package of proposals is designed
to deliver significant savings by streamlining
the procedures for handling major projects
and speeding the decision-making process, so
reducing delay, costs and uncertainty for those
involved and securing more quickly the
benefits of approved projects.
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
‘environmental statement’, which should
describe the likely environmental effects and
measures to minimise any adverse ones.
Planning authorities must consider the
environmental statement, and any
representations received, before granting
planning permission.
The Architects Registration Board,
together with the architects’ professional
bodies, exercises control over standards in
architectural training, and encourages high
standards in the profession. The Royal Town
Planning Institute carries out similar functions
for the planning profession.
HOUSING
The Government’s objective for housing is to
offer everyone the opportunity of a decent
home and so promote social cohesion, well¬
being and self-dependence. The Government
is making available nearly £5 billion extra for
investment in housing over the life of this
Parliament. In England and Northern Ireland
it is the responsibility of the Secretaries of
State for the Environment, Transport and
the Regions and for Northern Ireland to
determine housing policy and supervise the
housing programme. Responsibility for
housing in Wales and Scotland has now
passed, respectively, to the new National
Assembly for Wales and to the Scottish
Parliament. In Great Britain, the
Government works closely with local
authorities (which are responsible for
preparing local housing strategies) and with
the private and voluntary sectors. In
England, the DETR also works with the
Housing Corporation, which regulates
registered social landlords (RSLs—see
p. 351) and provides financial support to help
345
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
them supply affordable housing. In Northern
Ireland, the DOENI has overall
responsibility for housing policy and works
closely with the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive (NIHE) on its implementation in
the public sector. The NIHE is the single
housing authority in the Province.
A new initiative to help raise the quality
of homes in England was launched in
February 1999. Housing Quality Indicators
will allow designers to ‘score’ housing
schemes in aspects such as internal and
external layout, space standards,
construction and energy efficiency. After
construction the ratings can be checked. The
Indicators will initially be used to evaluate
new publicly funded housing schemes, and
the Housing Corporation has recommended
that all RSLs use them. The DETR will
carry out trials on new and existing stock in
both the public and private sectors, to assess
the Indicators’ potential for use across the
whole of the housing sector.
Housing Stock and Housebuilding
At the end of 1998 there was a stock of 20.8
million dwellings in England, 1.26 million in
Wales and 596,000 in Northern Ireland. In
Scotland, there were estimated to be 2.27
million dwellings in 1997. Estimated housing
completions in Great Britain during 1998 at
168,900 were 7% lower than in 1997. Around
86% of new dwellings are constructed by the
private sector for sale to owner-occupiers.
Owner-occupied homes represented about
67% of all dwellings at the end of 1997;
rented homes from local authorities and New
Town development corporations 17%; those
rented privately or with a job or business
11%; and those rented from registered social
landlords 5%.
The number of households in England is
projected to increase from 20.2 million in 1996
to 24.0 million in 2021, a slightly lower
increase than in the previous forecast.
Although the numbers of households in all
regions are projected to grow, the size of the
increase varies across England. It ranges from
around 25% in the South East, East of
England and the South West to under 10% in
the North East.
In England there were an estimated
753,200 vacant dwellings at 1 April 1998:
• 623,200 were in the private sector, many
of which represent transitional vacancies
(properties lying vacant for a short period
as part of the normal buying and selling
process);
• 81,700 were council homes, 49,500 of
which were properties available for
letting immediately, or after minor
repairs;
• 29,400 were in the RSL sector; and
• 19,000 were elsewhere within the public
sector, the majority of these being owned
by central government (Ministry of
Defence and other departments).
In Scotland, the Empty Homes Initiative
received a £15 million boost in November
1998, bringing total investment to £24 million
from 1997-98 to 2001-02. The extra money
will help councils develop vacant homes as
affordable housing for those who need it most.
Home Ownership
At the end of 1997, the number of owner-
occupied dwellings in the UK was 16.7
million, 67% of all dwellings. In England, the
highest areas of owner occupation at the end
of 1998 were in the South East at 74.7%,
followed by the South West at 72.8%, while
the East Midlands at 54.9% and Greater
London at 56.1% were the lowest. The
percentage of owner occupation for Wales and
Northern Ireland were 71.5% and 71.4%
respectively. In Scotland, where owner
occupation has traditionally been lower, the
figure reached 60.2% by the end of 1997.
Owner-occupiers may own their properties
outright, but many are in the process of
paying off a mortgage loan to a bank or
building society.
‘Right to buy’ (see p. 348)—introduced in
1980—has been the main route into owner-
occupation for former public sector tenants.
By the end of 1998, some 2.3 million council,
housing association and New Town
development corporation houses had been
sold into owner-occupation in Great Britain,
and sales are currently around 60,000 a year.

Mortgage Loans
A feature of home ownership in the UK is the
relatively high proportion of homes owned
with a mortgage. Most people buy their homes
with a mortgage loan, using the property as
security. These are obtained mainly through
banks and building societies, as well as from
insurance companies, other financial
institutions and local authorities. Some
companies offer low-interest loans to their
employees.
There are two main types of mortgage: a
repayment mortgage, where the borrower’s
monthly payment covers the interest
repayment and a contribution towards
repaying the capital, so that the loan will be
paid off at the end of the mortgage period; and
an interest-only mortgage, under which the
payment covers the interest charge and a
contribution towards a fund which builds up
with the aim of achieving a lump sum
sufficient to repay the loan in full at the end of
the mortgage period. Most funds are
endowments, linked to an insurance policy,
but a growing number of funds go into other
investments, such as a personal pension or
ISAs (individual savings accounts), which
succeeded PEPs from April 1999 (see p. 518).
In the second quarter of 1999, interest-only
mortgages accounted for 52.5% of new
mortgages taken out in the UK, and
repayment mortgages 46%, according to the
Council of Mortgage Lenders. Endowment
mortgages have recently become less popular
with borrowers because of falling interest rates
and the possibility that policies may not grow
fast enough to repay the capital borrowed.
The amount that mortgage lenders are
prepared to advance to potential house
purchasers is usually calculated as a multiple of
their annual income, typically up to three times
their earnings, usually over a term of 25 years.
Owner-occupiers have been able to claim tax

relief on interest payments on the first £30,000
of their mortgages on their main home, but this
will end in April 2000 (see p. 407).
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML)
introduced a voluntary Mortgage Code in
1997 for mortgage lenders which now covers
virtually the entire mortgage market. The
Code is designed to set benchmark standards
of good mortgage lending practice. At
present, help with mortgage payments
through the benefits system is confined to
people receiving Income Support or income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 175).
Furthermore, most claimants wait for nine
months before Income Support Mortgage
Interest is paid. In the Government’s view,
home buyers therefore need better, more
effective, insurance to protect their mortgage
payments against unforeseen periods of
financial difficulty caused by problems such
as accidents, sickness and unemployment.
The CML and Association of British Insurers
announced in February 1999 a new
benchmark for insurance products for
mortgage payment protection which all
lenders and insurers need to meet or exceed
in new policies from July 1999.
The number of homes repossessed by
mortgage lenders in the first half of 1999,
according to the CML, was 16,410, 5% lower
than in the same period a year earlier.
Right to Buy and Low-cost Ownership
With few exceptions, public tenants across the
UK with secure tenancies (see p. 352) of at least
two years’ standing are entitled to buy their
house or flat at a discount, dependent upon the
length of their tenancy, under the Right to Buy
scheme. New regional discount limits on the
sale of property under this scheme were
introduced in England in February 1999. They
are based on 70% of the average local authority
prices in each region (65% in London, where
pressure on social housing is currently
greatest), rounded up to the nearest £2,000.
The limits range from £22,000 in the North
East to £38,000 in London and the South East.
These limits replaced the previous discount of
up to £50,000 across the country.
Other schemes which aim to increase low-
cost home ownership include shared
The Government has carried out a wide-
ranging study of home buying to identify
the causes of delays and other problems
being experienced by home buyers and
sellers. A consultation paper was issued in
December 1998 setting out proposals for
improving the home buying and selling
process in England and Wales. A key
proposal is that, before marketing a
property, the seller should assemble a pack
of information to be made available to
prospective buyers when the property is
marketed. Other proposals include the
adoption by lenders of voluntary targets
for dealing with mortgage applications,
and adherence by local authorities to the
target of replying to searches within ten
working days.
ownership schemes, in which homeowners
buy a share of their property from a registered
social landlord and pay rent for the remainder,
discounted sales of empty properties by local
authorities, and interest-free equity loans and
cash grants to tenants to help them move out
and buy a property on the open market.
In England, the Homebuy scheme,
introduced in April 1999, helps tenants of
RSLs and local authorities, or those selected
from the council waiting list, living in areas
with a shortage of social housing to buy a
home on the open market. Homebuy offers
qualifying tenants an interest-free equity loan
to meet 25% of the cost of buying a home of
their own. Local authorities may continue to
fund the Do-it-Yourself Shared Ownership
scheme (DIYSO) for at least another two
years where this makes a useful contribution
to their housing strategies. DIYSO allows
local authority and RSL tenants living in
areas with a shortage of social housing to buy
a home on the open market on shared
ownership terms with an RSL. Local
authorities can also offer grants to local
authority tenants to assist them to move out
and buy a home. The level of grant varies
between local authorities.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme allowing purchasers to buy
a home for 70% of its value, the balance being

secured as a charge on the property. Scottish
Homes (see p. 351) operates a scheme to
encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation in areas they would not
normally consider. The Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association administers
the ‘buy half-rent half (shared ownership)
scheme operating in the Province.
Rented Sector
At the end of 1997, over 21% of all homes
were rented to tenants by the public sector
and non-profit-making bodies (such as
housing associations). The highest level was in
Scotland, with 33% of homes. Together with
the Irish Republic and the Netherlands, the
UK has one of the smallest privately rented
sectors in the European Union (10.4% of
homes), with Greater London at 17.3% at the
end of 1997 the highest in the UK.
Privately Rented Housing
The Government wants to see a healthy
private rented sector. Assured and assured-
shorthold tenancies enable landlords to charge
a reasonable market rent and recover
possession of their property when they need
to. The Housing Act 1996 introduced
measures to encourage small landlords in
England and Wales to let property, by
reducing paperwork for letting on an assured-
shorthold tenancy and by speeding up action
on rent arrears. A ‘Rent a Room’ scheme
enables homeowners to let rooms to lodgers
without having to pay tax on rents up to a
level of about £80 a week.
From 1 February 1999, increases in fair
rents in England were limited by linking them
to the Retail Prices Index. This is expected to
bring relief to thousands of tenants, many of
them elderly and on fixed incomes, with
regulated tenancies starting before January
1989. Some of these tenants had been facing
excessive increases as a result of recent court
cases.
Plans have also been announced by the
Government to tackle the problems of some
private tenants in getting back their rent
deposits at the end of their tenancies.
Organisations representing landlords and
tenants have been invited to set up a voluntary
self-financing scheme to ensure that tenants’
deposits are held safely and also to provide an

There are about 900,000 leaseholders of
houses in England and Wales and more
than 1 million leaseholders of flats. The
Government wishes to improve security of
tenure and other conditions for
leaseholders. Proposals, contained in a
consultation paper issued in 1998, include
making it easier for leaseholders of flats to
join together to buy the freehold; a new
right to manage their block of flats for
people who do not want to buy; a range of
options for improving management
standards and controlling the activities of
property managers; and options to tackle
landlords who use the threat of forfeiture
proceedings to intimidate leaseholders into
paying unreasonable charges. The
Government also plans to introduce a new
form of tenure for flats—commonhold—
which enables individual flat owners in a

A consultation paper on proposals for a
national Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO)
licensing scheme was issued in February 1999.
This, with related legislative changes, will
strengthen local authorities’ powers to ensure
acceptable standards in HMOs, where the worst
housing conditions are often found.
Social Housing
The Government supports partnership
between the public sector, RSLs, such as
housing associations, and the private sector as
providers of good quality social housing—
housing provided at rents affordable to people
on low incomes, usually below market prices
and with rent rises tending to be in line with
inflation.
Public Housing
Most social housing in Great Britain is
provided by local housing authorities—the
structure of local authorities is outlined on
pp. 62-4. Public housing in Scotland is also
350
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
provided by Scottish Homes, which currently
has a stock of 15,000 homes. However, it is in
the process of transferring its houses to
alternative landlords, such as housing
associations. In Northern Ireland, the NIHE is
responsible for the assessment of the need for,
and arranging for the supply of, social housing
and, in 1998-99, it managed just over 134,000
houses. Since 1996 an increasing amount of
social housing has been provided by
Registered Housing Associations.
Public housing authorities in England own
about 4.5 million houses and flats. Around 90
authorities have transferred all or part of their
stock to RSLs, involving the transfer of more
than 360,000 properties by mid-1999 and
raising over £6 billion in private finance.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
modernising their housing stock from central
government grants, their own resources,
including receipts, and from borrowing. Local
authorities commonly borrow from the Public
Works Loan Board—an independent statutory
body—and private sector financial bodies.
Local authorities in England have been
allocated ^1.4 billion in 1999-2000 to help
meet housing and housing-related
regeneration needs through the Housing
Investment Programme (£838 million) and
the Capital Receipts Initiative (£570 million).
This money provides additional resources to
improve existing council houses, to fund
private sector renovation grants and to
support the building or acquisition of homes
by RSLs. Local authorities in Wales and
Scotland are receiving net capital allocations
(including the Capital Receipts Initiative) for
1999-2000 amounting to £201 million and
£155 million respectively. The NIHE’s
capital programme is financed mainly by
borrowing from government and receipts
from house sales; in 1999-2000 borrowing
will total £16 million. Revenue expenditure is
funded from rental income and by a
government grant, which in 1999-2000 is
about £159 million.
Housing revenue accounts are kept separate
from other council funds. The Government
grants English and Welsh local authorities
Housing Revenue Account Subsidy, planned
at £3.5 billion in England and £172 million in
Wales in 1999-2000. In Scotland, Housing
Support Grant of £13 million and £274
million grant-in-aid to Scottish Homes are
planned for 1999-2000.
In Scotland, the Government has
committed a further £278 million to its New
Housing partnerships initiative. This, together
with private sector investment, is expected to
provide 5,000 new homes, improve 2,500
more and support around 9,000 jobs. Forty-
five new partnership projects will receive
assistance, including development,
regeneration and transfer partnerships. The
latter could result in 25% of council houses
transferring to community ownership by 2002,
leading to increased investment in
improvement and repairs programmes.
Registered Social Landlords
Registered Social Landlords are the major
providers of new subsidised homes for those in
housing need. They own and manage 1.135
million self-contained units in England,
including 169,000 units of sheltered
accommodation and 29,000 units of supported
housing. They are diverse bodies, ranging
from small almshouses to very large housing
associations managing many thousands of
homes. They also include large-scale voluntary
transfer and local housing companies, set up to
own and manage council houses transferred
out of the local authority sector.
RSLs are non-profit-making bodies run by
voluntary committees and over 2,200 are
registered with the Housing Corporation, a
non-departmental public body responsible for
funding and regulating RSLs in England.
The Corporation ensures RSLs provide their
tenants with substantial rights and a good
quality of service. It provides public funding
to help RSLs supply affordable homes for
rent and for sale, and to support the
management and service costs of schemes for
tenants with special needs (for example, for
frail older people and tenants with learning
difficulties).
Since 1988, 92 local authorities in England
have transferred all or part of their housing
stock to new RSLs, with the support of the
tenants and the approval of the Secretary of
State for the Environment, Transport and the
Regions. The transfers, involving over
351
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
350,000 dwellings, have generated more than
£3 billion in capital receipts, and raised over
£6 billion of private finance to spend on
improvements. In 1999—2000 over 130,000
local authority dwellings are expected to be
transferred to new landlords.
The Government has extended the
permissible powers of RSLs in England and
Wales to allow them to play a full part in bringing
new life to their communities. They will still
focus the majority of their work on providing
housing to tenants, but they are now able to
provide services and amenities to people who are
not resident in RSL property, as long as some of
their tenants benefit. They can also engage in
wider social regeneration activities such as the
New Deal for Communities (see p. 356).
Similar arrangements apply in Wales with the
National Assembly’s Housing Department, in
Scotland with Scottish Homes and in Northern
Ireland with housing associations under the
strategic direction of the NIHE. RSL schemes
can also be funded by local authority resources.
Northern Ireland’s 40 Registered Housing
Associations which build for rent, plan to start
2,200 new homes in 1999—2000 and to spend
£10 million which includes £3.6 million on
the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership Housing
Association. Housing association schemes are
expected to attract some £40 million in private
finance in 1999-2000.
Tenants’ Rights
Local authority tenants in England, Wales and
Scotland have security of tenure and other
statutory rights, which are set out in the
Council Tenant’s Charter. In addition to the
right to buy, these include the right to have
certain urgent repairs done quickly at no cost to
themselves and the right to be reimbursed for
any improvements which they have financed
should they move home. Tenants must be kept
closely involved in the process of letting tenders
to manage council estates. They also have the
right to take over their estates through tenant
management organisations. Some 150 are
operational and another 100 are in the process
of development. Tenants of RSLs enjoy similar
rights to those of local authority tenants. These
are set out in the Secure Tenant’s Charter and
the Assured Tenant’s Charter, produced by the
Housing Corporation.
A government consultation paper, published
in January 1999, proposes to give council tenants
in England and Wales a central role in the
planning, management and delivery of housing
services through new Tenant Participation
Compacts. Under these proposals, local housing
authorities will have to negotiate by April 2000
council-wide and neighbourhood-level
agreements with their tenants. The Compacts
will set out clearly how tenants will be involved
collectively in shaping local decisions on housing
issues. Councils will also have to provide
training and support for tenants, so that they can
fully take up their role. The Compacts will be
based on a national framework which, for the
first time, sets national core standards for tenant
participation. A similar consultation exercise has
already been carried out in Scotland and a
National Strategy on Tenant Participation was
launched in March 1999.
Housing for Older People
Sheltered housing provides specialised facilities
for older people, such as common and laundry
rooms, alarm systems and resident or non¬
resident warden support. Increased emphasis is
being placed on schemes to help the elderly
continue to live in their own homes by, for
example, adapting their present homes to meet
particular needs. In England, 184 home
improvement agencies assist elderly and
disabled people and those on low incomes to
carry out repairs and improvements to their
properties. Government funding for this work
has been raised to £6.6 million for 1999-2000 to
2001-02. Under the three-year matched
funding scheme, local authorities are required to
give similar financial support. Similar schemes
operate in Scotland and Wales.
In the longer term, support services for
older people, such as those provided in
sheltered housing and by home improvement
agencies, will be funded through new
arrangements for local housing and social
services authorities to jointly commission
support services. The proposals for these
arrangements were set out in a consultation
document in December 1998.
352
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Rural Housing
If a clear need exists for low-cost housing in
rural areas, local authorities can permit
housing in localities where development
would normally not be allowed, as long as the
new housing can be reserved to meet that
need. The Housing Corporation finances a
special rural programme to build houses in
villages with a population of 3,000 or less;
funding for the building of 16,000 such homes
has been approved since 1989-90. The
National Assembly for Wales Housing
Department has an extensive programme
devoted to rural areas, and in Scotland
considerable progress is being made through a
range of initiatives as part of the Scottish
Homes Rural Strategy. A rural strategy is also
operated by the NIHE.
Improving Existing Housing
Slum clearance and large-scale redevelopment
used to be major features of housing policy in
urban areas of the UK. Recently there has
been a trend towards the modernisation and
conversion of sub-standard homes in order to
help maintain existing communities. Housing
conditions have improved considerably, but
problems remain in some areas where there
are concentrations of dwellings requiring
substantial repairs. In some cases, however,
clearance may still be the most satisfactory
course of action. To help overcome objections
to clearance, local authorities can pay a
discretionary relocation grant to those
displaced to enable them to buy at least a part
share in a new home in the same area. In Great
Britain, about 6,300 dwellings were
demolished or closed in 1997.
Social Housing
Rundown estates are being improved through
the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge
Fund (see p. 355), which encourages local
partnerships in England to tackle social and
economic problems, including housing
improvements. The Estates Renewal
Challenge Fund, set up in 1995 with the aim
of regenerating some of the remaining big,
rundown local authority estates by facilitating
their transfer to RSLs, enables private finance
to be raised to help meet some of the costs. In
all, £525 million is being spent by 24 local
authorities on 39 transfer schemes involving
over 44,000 homes. The third, and final,
round of funding was announced in 1998.
Housing Action Trusts (HATs), non-
departmental public bodies, took over some of
the worst local authority housing estates
between 1991 and 1994, in London
(Stonebridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham
Forest), Birmingham (Castle Vale), Liverpool
and North Hull. With £650 million of public
expenditure to date, they have provided more
than 2,400 new and 2,500 renovated homes,
trained over 8,000 residents and helped over
5,000 people into jobs. The North Hull eight-
year programme was completed in March
1999. A further £445 million is planned to be
spent on the remaining HATs programme.
In Wales, Estate Partnership was set up to
assist local authorities in tackling the worst
problems on local authority housing estates by
co-ordinating efforts to raise the quality of the
housing stock, along with social and
environmental improvements. Options
include transferring ownership to the private
sector. A total of £6.5 million is forecast to be
spent in 1999-2000 by central government, to
supplement local authority and private sector
contributions.
Private Housing
The Government offers assistance through
house renovation grants to owners of private
housing who are on low incomes and unable to
afford necessary repairs and improvements.
Specific help is available to disabled people
needing adaptations to their homes. Grants
may provide up to 100% support to the
poorest homeowners for essential repairs and
improvements. In addition, in Scotland there
is a grant scheme called the Warm Deal to
improve home energy efficiency, under which
grants of £500 are available to eligible
households for measures to reduce fuel bills or
provide more warmth for the same cost.
Scottish local authorities award grants for
improvement and repair. Scottish Homes also
has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
353
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
private house renewal. In Northern Ireland,
funding is allocated through the house
renovation grants scheme, administered by the
NIHE, on a similar basis to that in England
and Wales. In rural areas, financial assistance
to replace isolated dwellings which cannot be
restored is also on offer.
Homelessness
Local authorities have legal duties to provide
housing assistance for families and vulnerable
people who are eligible for assistance,
unintentionally homeless and in priority need.
The priority need group includes households
with dependent children or containing a
pregnant woman; people who are vulnerable as
a result of old age, mental or physical illness or
disability or other special reason; and people
who are homeless in an emergency. The
Government introduced new regulations in
1997 to ensure that people assisted under
homelessness legislation will receive
reasonable preference in the allocation of
social tenancies from the local authority
housing register. In Scotland, a new code of
guidance on homelessness was issued in 1997.
Northern Ireland policy on homelessness
broadly follows that in England and Wales and
is reviewed taking account of any changes to
policies or legislation there.
In 1998-99, local authorities in England
made a total of 245,480 decisions on
applications for housing from households
eligible under the homelessness provisions of
the 1985 and 1996 Housing Acts. They
accepted more than 105,470 households as
meeting the conditions of eligibility for
assistance. Of these acceptances, 27% arose
because parents, relatives or friends were no
longer able, or willing, to accommodate the
household, and 24% were because of the
breakdown of a relationship with a partner. In
1997—98 it is estimated that some 43,118
households were assessed as homeless or
potentially homeless in Scotland, of which over
a quarter (12,665) were in Glasgow. In
1998_995 4,997 households were accepted by
the NIHE as being in need of priority housing.
The Government aims to reduce the
number of people sleeping rough on the
streets in England by two-thirds between 1999
and 2002. Funding is now through the
Homelessness Action Programme, which
replaced the original Rough Sleepers
Initiative1 in April 1999.
In London, the London Rough Sleepers
Unit, established in April 1999, has a budget
of £145 million over the three years to March
2002. Almost £39 million of capital and
associated revenue funding has been allocated
to 26 housing associations. This will provide
almost 500 units of move-on accommodation,
new hostel places and the refurbishment or
replacement of more than 200 places in
existing hostels. The funding will also provide
support services to ensure that former rough
sleepers do not subsequently lose their
accommodation. Outside London, a total of
£34 million has been allocated to voluntary
organisations over three years from April 1999
to help tackle and prevent rough sleeping.
From September 1999, responsibility for
reducing rough sleeping across England has
been integrated within the Rough Sleepers
Unit.
A scheme, Safe in the City, to prevent
youth homelessness, is operating in eight
London boroughs. The total cost of the
project is £11.8 million, partly funded by a £6
million Single Regeneration Budget grant, and
partly by private sector sponsorship. The
Index of Homelessness Risk, published by
Safe in the City in March 1999, has been
developed as a method for identifying young
people likely to become homeless, so they can
be helped at an early stage.
In Wales, £1.1 million has been allocated in
1999-2000 to support voluntary organisations,
of which £785,000, in partnership with local
authorities, will help alleviate rough sleeping.
Provision in Scottish Executive expenditure on
homeless initiatives over a three-year period
from 1997-98 to 1999-2000 was £16 million
under the Rough Sleepers Initiative, and
£804,000 under grants to voluntary bodies.
Under the Housing Act 1996, local
authorities have a duty to secure the provision

the problem of sleeping rough on the streets has been

of advice to prevent homelessness. Housing
associations and other voluntary bodies supply
such advice and undertake a number of other
roles, for example advising people about their
rights under housing law or encouraging
energy efficiency in the home.
REGENERATION
The main objective of regeneration policy is to
enhance economic development and social
cohesion by effective regional action and
integrated local regeneration programmes.
These programmes work through partnership
between the public and private sectors and
involve a substantial contribution from the
latter. They support and complement other
programmes tackling social and economic
decline, and initiatives such as Welfare-to-
Work (see p. 154), health action zones (see
p. 189), employment zones (see p. 155) and
the work of the Cabinet Office Social
Exclusion Unit (see p. 117).
The Government is adopting a more
coherent approach to regional economic
development and planning, and intends to
improve regional accountability. Devolution
has taken place in Scotland and Wales from
July 1999 (see chapters 4 and 5) and eight
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in
the English regions outside London were
established in 1999, with a ninth planned for
London in 2000. The RDAs have taken over
rural regeneration programmes from the Rural
Development Commission, regional
regeneration programmes from English
Partnerships, and the administration of the
Single Regeneration Budget (formerly SRB
Challenge Fund) from the Government
Offices for the Regions (GOs—see p. 9). They
will also be responsible for co-ordinating
inward investment in their own regions. The
nine GOs work in partnership with local
people to maximise competitiveness,
prosperity and quality of life in each region.
Rundown areas in the UK benefit from EU
Structural Funds (see p. 395), notably the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF), which assists a wide variety of
projects in the least prosperous urban and
rural areas of the European Union. Its
objectives include promoting the development
of regions lagging behind the rest of the EU
{Objective 7), and redeveloping regions that are
seriously affected by industrial decline
{Objective 2).
England
The Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions has overall
responsibility for the Single Regeneration
Budget (SRB) and the New Deal for
Communities (NDC).
The SRB provides resources to support
regeneration initiatives in England carried out
by local regeneration partnerships. It is an
important instrument in the Government’s
drive to tackle social exclusion and promote
equality. In 1998 the Government announced
resources of £2.4 billion for SRB over the
three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. Around
80% of additional resources of £770 million
will be targeted on the most deprived local
authority areas of England, with the balance
being used to tackle pockets of deprivation
elsewhere, including rural areas and former
coalfield areas. Since 1 April 1999, SRB has
been administered by RDAs in all regions
except London, where the Government Office
will continue to administer until the transfer
to the Greater London Authority in April
2000, subject to legislation.
Regeneration partnerships, consisting of
key local organisations including the voluntary
sector, can bid for SRB resources to support
regeneration. There have been five annual
‘bidding rounds’. In July 1999, the
Government announced details of successful
bids under the fifth round; 163 schemes were
approved worth over £1 billion in SRB
support over their lifetime of up to seven
years. These aim to attract over £2.4 billion in
other public and private investment. This is
on top of over 600 schemes under the first
four rounds which already stand to receive
over £3.4 billion of SRB money over the
lifetime of up to seven years.
Key outputs forecast for the fifth SRB
round include 156,000 people trained; jobs for
over 65,000 target area residents; and over 1.3
million people to benefit from community
safety initiatives. This is in addition to
projected results from the first four rounds,
355
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
which envisage the creation or safeguarding of
670,000 jobs, with over 650,000 people trained
and obtaining qualifications; over 83,000
business start-ups; 330,000 dwellings built or
improved; and 53,000 voluntary groups
supported.
About £800 million is planned to be spent
by the private sector on redeveloping the
Birmingham city centre Bull Ring
shopping area and so revitalising the
eastern side of the city centre. The eight-
year plan should create an additional 5,000
retailing jobs and will be the biggest retail
regeneration project in Europe. Alongside
the shops will be an indoor market,
restaurants and leisure facilities. It will be
twice the size of the Lakeside out-of-town
shopping centre in Essex.
Some of the country’s poorest
neighbourhoods will get help through the
NDC. Over the next three years £800 million
will be available to help tackle the problems of
multiple deprivation and social exclusion faced
by people in these neighbourhoods. Key
objectives of the NDC include tackling the
problems of worklessness, high levels of crime,
poor health and educational
underachievement. Initially 17 areas in
England are eligible for NDC funding.
English Partnerships
The regional roles, functions, staff and assets
of English Partnerships, a non-departmental
public body, were taken over by RDAs from 1
April 1999 and its central core merged with
the Commission for New Towns; in London
the transfer will take place in 2000. English
Partnerships has promoted job creation,
inward investment and environmental
improvement, through the reclamation of
vacant, derelict or contaminated land in areas
of need throughout England, within a
framework of sustainable development. It has
been funded through grant-in-aid and through
its own activities. Direct expenditure in
1999-2000 is planned to be £76 million, which
includes spending on the Greenwich
Millennium site (see p. ix). A further £155
million is also available and includes
investment under the Partnership Investment
Programme. It has also attracted
complementary funding from the ERDF and
the private sector.
Coalfields Regeneration
In a report in June 1998, the Coalfields task
force made a number of recommendations for
revitalising the former coalfields communities
affected by pit closures. In December 1998 the
Government announced a ten-year
programme to regenerate coalfield
communities with an investment package of
£354 million over three years. This comprised
£196 million under an English Partnerships
Coalfields programme, extra resources of £70
million from the SRB, £45 million for a new
Coalfields Regeneration Trust, £28 million for
housing and £15 million for a new Coalfield
Enterprise Fund.
Groundwork
Groundwork comprises a national co¬
ordinating body, the Groundwork
Foundation, 43 trusts and a subsidiary
company, the National Urban Forestry Unit.
In 1998-99, funding of £7.5 million, together
with £11.5 million from the private sector,
supported project activities in 38 local English
Trusts. These trusts develop partnerships at
local level between the public, private and
voluntary sectors to carry out environmental
regeneration projects. In 1998—99,
Groundwork upgraded an estimated 1,560
hectares of land, planted 669,000 trees, helped
653 businesses improve their environmental
performance and involved 80,612 volunteers.
Urban Policy
The Urban Task Force was set up in 1998 to
find out the causes of urban decline in
England and to recommend practical solutions
to make cities, towns and neighbourhoods
more attractive places in which to live. Its
report, launched in June 1999, sets out a broad
range of recommendations. The report will
inform the Government in preparing its

PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
planned White Paper on Urban Poliey, due to
be issued by the end of 1999, which will look
at education and training, jobs, health, crime
and safety, cultural and leisure activities,
housing, regeneration, planning, transport,
local government and environmental issues. It
will complement work being carried out by the
Social Exclusion Unit on deprived
neighbourhoods.
Rural Development
Although most problems arising from
dereliction and unemployment occur in urban
areas, some rural areas have also been affected
as employment in traditional sectors, such as
agriculture, mining and rurally based defence
establishments, has declined. Low wages and a
decline in local public transport and other
services have caused problems for some rural
residents. The movement of people into the
countryside from towns has increased pressure
on housing and this is likely to continue.
However, some rural areas have been
successful in recent years in attracting high-
technology industries, while the spread of
modern telecommunications facilities and
information technology has made it much
easier for people to work from home.
The Rural Development Commission
(RDC), which used to act as the Government’s
statutory adviser on the economic and social
development of rural areas of England, and
promoted regeneration through a variety of
programmes, merged with the Countryside
Commission to form the new Countryside
Agency in April 1999 (see p. 319). The
Countryside Agency retains responsibilities for
innovative and pilot projects, while the RDC’s
rural regeneration programmes have been
transferred to the new RDAs.
Rural areas benefit from resources directed
through the SRB. The Rural Challenge Fund2
has been incorporated into the SRB and bids
covering rural areas will be eligible for SRB
support. In addition, the RDAs’ rural
regeneration programmes are supporting a
variety of projects in designated rural
development areas. The Government will be

setting out its policies for rural England in a
White Paper to be published in 2000.
Wales
Parts of Wales have been adversely affected by
the decline in traditional industries, especially
the coal industry. In particular, the South
Wales valleys have some of the most
economically disadvantaged communities.
The Valleys Forum, launched in 1998, is
committed to increasing economic prosperity
and the quality of life for all the people of the
South Wales valleys. Regeneration will be
taken forward within the framework of the
National Development Strategy being
prepared for consultation by the European
Structural Funds Task Force.
Work in progress in Wales to a great extent
mirrors that being addressed in England. It
embraces a broad span of responsibilities,
including social inclusion, competitiveness,
housing, delivery of public services, regional
development, planning, transport, community
involvement, voluntary sector issues,
sustainable development, education, training
and crime prevention. The National Assembly
for Wales will take forward policies aimed at
improving the lives of those living in Wales’
urban communities.
The main economic regeneration scheme
operated directly by the National Assembly
has been the Welsh Capital Challenge, which
supports an integrated approach to capital
expenditure and promotes sustainable
regeneration or development and benefits
disadvantaged areas, with particular emphasis
on those in the South Wales valleys, west
Wales and the most deprived rural areas.
Approved local authority regeneration
projects, on which expenditure of £31 million
is planned in 1999-2000, are expected to lead
to the creation of 2,300 jobs as a direct result,
with a further 2,200 projected for the longer
term if the private sector funding of £50
million for site development and other
industrial and commercial development is
secured.
Coalfields communities in Wales are included
in the remit of the Coalfields Regeneration
Trust, (see p. 356). The work of the Trust will
substantially boost the efforts being made to
357
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
secure economic, social and environmental
regeneration throughout the former coalfields, in
both north and south Wales. The National
Assembly for Wales will be making a
contribution of £3.5 million over three years.
Four Groundwork Trusts operate in
Wales, covering five local authority areas.
Groundwork Wales has recently been set up
to ensure the development and future co¬
ordination of Groundwork in Wales. In 1997
the ‘Changing Places’ Millennium projects
were launched in Wales. Funding of over £7
million was awarded by the Millennium
Commission, to be matched by the
Groundwork Foundation, resulting in projects
worth over £13 million. The bid aims to
improve the environment in celebration of the
new Millennium and will create new
community facilities on derelict land in the
three valley areas of Bridgend, Caerphilly and
Merthyr Tydfil. In 1998-99 Groundwork
worked with over 4,500 volunteers, planted
over 1,000 trees and shrubs and advised over
200 businesses on environmental issues.
The Rural Partnership for Wales is an
advisory body that brings together
representatives of the National Assembly, the
Welsh Development Agency, the Welsh Local
Government Association, the farming unions
and other key interested parties with an interest
in the countryside. One of its key tasks is the
development of a statement on rural Wales for
consideration by the National Assembly.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation
was set up in 1987 to regenerate almost 1,100
hectares of South Cardiff. Its main priority is
the £197 million Barrage project, construction
of which will be completed in late 1999. Work
is under way to provide a 375-hectare bird
reserve on the Gwent Levels, south of
Newport, to compensate for the loss of the
Cardiff Bay habitat from impoundment of the
Bay by the Barrage. The Corporation will be
wound up on 31 March 2000, when it is
expected to have achieved over 70% of its
main targets including 29,000 jobs created or
safeguarded in the Bay area and £1.4 billion of
private sector investment attracted.
Under the Government of Wales Act 1998,
the Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
merged with the Development Board for
Rural Wales and the Land Authority for
Wales. The enlarged WDA now has broader
functions and powers and is better placed to
contribute to economic regeneration across the
whole of Wales. It runs four main programmes
covering urban and rural regeneration. Two of
the programmes are ‘Business Infrastructure’,
which includes a programme of land
reclamation, the development of strategic sites
for development and environmental
improvements; and Community Regeneration,
which includes provision for Urban
Investment Grants, Town Improvement
Grants and individual initiatives such as those
in the slate valleys in north Wales and market
towns in mid-Wales.
Scotland
In 1999-2000 some £68 million is earmarked
for the area regeneration programme. In
particular, the Government seeks to help
excluded communities and people through
Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs). SIPs will
focus on the most needy members of society,
co-ordinate and fill gaps between existing
programmes to promote inclusion, and seek to
prevent people becoming socially excluded.
Support is also provided to city-wide
partnerships.
The Urban Programme has been the means
by which grants are paid to councils in order to
meet social needs in deprived areas. It has
supported individual projects approved under
previous policy arrangements, and partnerships
in Priority Partnership Areas and Regeneration
Programme areas designated in 1996. A review
was undertaken in 1998 to ensure that this
funding mechanism could effectively support
the new SIPs and that regeneration money
could be spent to achieve a lasting impact. The
Programme became the Social Inclusion
Partnership Fund from April 1999, and 26 new
SIPs began their work then. A total of £48
million has so far been allocated on supporting
the new SIPs in the three years to 2002.
Funding will also be provided through the
Working for Communities and Listening to
Communities programmes to test and develop
new models for delivering integrated local
services in deprived areas, and developing the
capacity of excluded communities to influence
decisions that affect their lives.
358
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Northern Ireland
Urban Regeneration programmes in Northern
Ireland are designed to reverse and ameliorate
urban decline and decay by improving the
infrastructure, environment, economy, and
the social and community fabric of
disadvantaged areas. The programmes are
managed by the Urban Regeneration Group
(URG) of the Department of the Environment
(NI). URG may operate directly or with other
government and public sector bodies, as well
as through grants to the private sector or
voluntary and community groups. Many of
the initiatives employed are geared towards
encouraging investment. URG’s annual gross
programme expenditure is £42 million, aside
from other resources which are realised
through participation in European Union and
International Fund for Ireland programmes.
The regeneration effort is focused on
Belfast and Londonderry and on major towns
and villages in the rest of the Province. URG
also administers the Belfast and Londonderry
sub-programmes of the European Union’s
Urban Initiative and the relevant parts of the
EU Special Support Programme for Peace and
Reconciliation throughout Northern Ireland.
Under the EU’s District Partnership scheme,
for example, 26 partnerships have been
established, one in each district council area,
which are composed of one-third elected
representatives, one-third from the
community and voluntary sector and one-
third from the business, trade union and
statutory agency sector. Overall over 600
people are involved in these Partnerships. By
June 1999 the District Partnerships, which
started in 1996, had spent £23 million on
2,624 projects across Northern Ireland.
Urban Development Grant (UDG) is the
principal urban regeneration measure in
Northern Ireland and is aimed at the most
rundown parts of Belfast and Londonderry
(some £4 million is planned to be spent in
1999-2000). In Belfast, UDG of £76 million
has, since 1983, generated £62 million of private
sector investment, while in Londonderry, UDG
of £34 million has generated some £125 million
of private sector investment.
Making Belfast Work was launched in 1988
to advance efforts being made by community
interests, the private sector and the
Government to address problems facing
residents in the most disadvantaged areas of
Belfast; £234 million had been allocated to
this initiative by March 1999. The
Londonderry Initiative was also launched in
1988 to address urban decline and to target
resources at the most disadvantaged parts of
the city. By March 1999 over £28 million had
been allocated to the Initiative.
The Laganside Corporation is charged with
regenerating the once derelict area around
Belfast docks and the city’s waterfront. To
date, cumulative public spending inclusive of
EU funds has been £90 million, attracting
£219 million of private sector and other
investment with a further £52 million on the
fringes of Laganside. It is estimated that 3,866
permanent jobs located in Laganside have
been created.

The Government is beginning to implement its integrated transport policy,
which is designed to make better use of existing facilities and infrastructure. A
higher priority is being given to more environmentally sustainable forms of
transport, such as walking and cycling. Public expenditure on transport will be
significantly higher in real terms in 2001-02 than in 1998-99, with additional
expenditure being provided over the three years to 2001—02 for modernising
local and public transport. Telecommunications services are expanding
rapidly, helped by substantial growth in demand for mobile telephones (there
are now some 16 million users) and for services over the Internet.

TRAVEL TRENDS
Passenger travel was 716 billion passenger-
kilometres in 1998 (see Table 22.1). Travel by
car, van and taxi has doubled in the past 25
years, and air travel has also grown
substantially. Travel by bus has experienced a
steady decline since the 1950s, but recently
bus patronage appears to have stabilised.
Motorcycling, walking and cycling have
declined in the last ten years. Rail travel has
recently been growing strongly again after a
period of decline in the first half of the 1990s,
and travel on the various light rail/supertram
systems is also rising.
Travel by car remains by far the most
popular mode of passenger travel, accounting
for 86% of passenger mileage within Great
Britain in 1998, compared with 44% in 1958.
Most freight is carried by road, which
accounts for 81% of goods by tonnage and
65% in terms of tonne-kilometres.1
At the end of 1998 there were 27.5 million
vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great
Britain, according to the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency, which maintains official
records of drivers and vehicles in Great
Britain. There were 22.1 million cars (of
which 2.3 million were company-owned); 2.4
million light goods vehicles; 412,000 other
goods vehicles; 684,000 motorcycles, scooters
and mopeds; and 80,000 public transport
vehicles with nine or more seats.
1 A tonne-kilometre is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for
1 kilometre.

The 20th century has seen a huge
expansion in motor vehicle usage. The first
British car was given its initial trial in 1896.
By 1950 there were around 2 million cars,
but 86% of households did not have access
to one. By 1998 there were about 22 million
cars; in 1996-97, 70% of households in the
UK owned one or more cars, 21.5% two or
more cars and 4.5% three or more cars.
Most of the rail network had been built by
1900, and the railways in the UK
(including the whole of Ireland) carried
1,142 million passengers and 425 million
tonnes of freight in that year. Tramways
were continuing to expand, and by the end
of 1900 there were 1,177 miles of tramway
in the UK (including Ireland); they carried
1,065 million passengers in 1900. At the
turn of the century the UK was the world’s
leading maritime nation, and in 1914 its
merchant fleet of 18.9 million gross tons
represented 42% of world shipping.
TRANSPORT POLICY
In 1998 the Government issued a White
Paper, A New Deal for Transport: Better for
Everyone, setting out its policy for creating an
integrated transport system to tackle the
growing problems of congestion and pollution.
Its main proposals include:
• better integration between different types
of transport, to improve connections, and
better co-ordination of transport policy
with other policies, such as on the
environment and land-use planning;
• new sources of funding for local
authorities, including charges for driving
into town centres and for workplace
parking, which will enable them to tackle
congestion and boost public transport;
• better local bus services, through
upgraded ‘quality partnerships’ between
local authorities and bus operators, and in
England and Wales minimum
concessionary bus fares for pensioners;
• a new Strategic Rail Authority;
• better information for travellers,
including a national public transport
information system to be introduced by
the year 2000;
• improved motoring conditions, with
greater resources for road maintenance
and better traffic information and
management;
• a review of safety arrangements across all
transport modes; and
• development of regional ports and
airports, so that they play their full part
in meeting local demand.
361
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Local transport plans (local transport
strategies in Scotland) will be a key
element in developing an integrated
transport system. The first plans are to be
produced by local authorities by July 2000.
The Government envisages that the plans
will favour public transport, walking and
cycling.
Following the White Paper, a series of
policy documents has been issued, including
papers on trunk roads, traffic congestion,
sustainable distribution, bus services and
shipping. Legislation will be required to
implement some of the proposals, for example,
to enable local authorities to charge for driving
into town centres and for parking at
workplaces. Public-Private Partnerships (see
p. 403) will have an increasingly important
role in transport, notably for the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link, the London Underground
and air traffic control.
A new Commission for Integrated
Transport has been set up to provide
independent advice to the UK Government
on implementing the integrated transport
policy, review progress towards meeting
government objectives, and identify best
practice on transport issues from the UK and
overseas. It will advise on setting targets for
road traffic and public transport, on lorry
weights and the development of rail freight,
the review of transport safety arrangements,
and progress on adopting ‘green transport’
plans (see p. 365).
The White Paper’s approach covers the
whole of the UK. Separate but
complementary White Papers/policy
documents have also been issued for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. A selection of
the main points is given below.
Wales
The integrated approach to transport policy in
Wales, now being taken forward by the
National Assembly for Wales, envisages
improved public transport in both urban and
rural areas—grants of £5 million are available
in 1999-2000 to support non-commercial bus
services and £250,000 is available for
community transport schemes in rural areas.
To lessen congestion, the Assembly will be
encouraging the introduction of car-sharing
arrangements and the adoption of traffic
management measures. It is also encouraging
all major employers to prepare green transport
plans—the National Assembly for Wales
already has its own plan. It is working with rail
and air operators to improve existing services
between north and south Wales, and to
introduce new ones. A new core network of
trunk roads, comprising east-west links in
north and south Wales, and important north-
south roads, will be the starting-point for
future trunk road investment priorities.
The Welsh Transport Advisory Group,
which included representatives of most
organisations with an interest in transport
issues in Wales, produced its final report in
March 1999, Developments in Transport Policy
in Wales, which will be taken forward by the
Assembly.
Scotland
The future strategy for transport in Scotland
was set out in the White Paper Travel Choices
for Scotland. New integrated local transport
strategies will be supported by a Public
Transport Fund, which is providing £90
million over the three years to 2001-02 to
support developments such as new railway
stations, ‘park-and-ride’ facilities, and bus
priority schemes. The Scottish Executive is
consulting on how to improve transport
co-ordination at the regional level.
A review of trunk roads is expected to be
completed later in 1999. Some £186 million is
being spent on motorways and trunk roads in
1999-2000. New schemes include the
completion of the final stage of the A74(M), a
key route to England.
For many remote communities in rural
Scotland, the car will remain the main form of
transport. The Scottish Executive is providing
£4.5 million a year to support rural transport
provision, including £3.5 million for public
transport services and £600,000 for
community transport projects. Substantial
additional support has been made available for
362
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
essential services to the Scottish Islands,
including £20 million for two new ferries in
the Hebrides and a new £9 million terminal,
opened in 1999, at Inverness Airport.
Developments in transport policy in
Scotland will be taken forward by the Scottish
Parliament and Executive (see chapter 4).
Northern Ireland
A key feature of the measures outlined in the
policy document for transport in Northern
Ireland, Moving Forward, is development of a
new Regional Transport Plan, initially
covering the five years from 2001-02.
Meanwhile, proposed improvements are being
taken forward in an interim plan, including:
• expenditure of £87 million on road
improvements, including upgrading
strategic routes and completion of by¬
passes for five towns and villages;
• investment of £ 16 million in new
buses—trials of electric buses are in
progress in Ballymena;
• reopening of the railway line from
Antrim to Bleach Green and upgrading
of railway track throughout the Province;
• more bus priority measures, including a
pilot ‘quality bus corridor’ in Belfast,
which would involve modern buses
running with greater frequency along a
series of bus lanes; and
• better facilities for cyclists and walkers,
and the establishment of strategies to
increase cycling and walking.
Transport is one of the functions to be
assumed by the new Northern Ireland
Assembly (see p. 18).
ROADS
The total road network in Great Britain in
1998 was 371,600 kilometres (231,000 miles).
Trunk motorways2 accounted for 3,300
kilometres (2,050 miles) of this, less than 1%,
and other trunk roads for over 12,200

of the central administration rather than the local authority.
kilometres (7,580 miles), or 3.3%. However,
motorways carry 18% of all traffic, and trunk
roads another 16%. Combined, they carry over
half of all goods vehicle traffic in Great Britain.
In Northern Ireland the road network is over
24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles), of which 111
kilometres (69 miles) are motorways.
Motor traffic in Great Britain was 1.7%
higher in 1998 than in 1997, rising to an
estimated 459.4 billion vehicle-kilometres (see
Table 22.2). Traffic on motorways is growing
much faster than on any other type of road,
rising by 27% between 1993 and 1998 to 81.1
billion vehicle-kilometres.
The central administration meets most of
the costs of construction and maintenance of
trunk roads, while local authorities are
responsible for non-trunk roads.

Road Programme
The Highways Agency—an executive agency
of the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)—is
improving the condition of the national road
network in England to minimise long-term
costs and disruption to the public. The
Agency is responsible for about 70% of the
motorway and trunk road network in England,
with the other 30% being the responsibility of

£1.5 billion. This is allocated in accordance
with the Agency’s new priorities, with the
emphasis being to make better use of existing
roads rather than building new roads. The
greatest allocation is to maintenance, which is
receiving £765 million.
The Agency’s seven-year programme of
road improvements has 37 schemes, costing a
total of £1.4 billion. Among the schemes are:
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver),
motorcycles and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,

• 21 for passenger vehicles with more than
nine seats and goods vehicles over 7.5
tonnes.
• improvements to 22 kilometres (14 miles)
of the A1(M) in Yorkshire, costing some
£210 million;
• a new dual carriageway in a tunnel to
remove traffic from the immediate
vicinity of the World Heritage Site at
Stonehenge (Wiltshire); and
• a £94 million scheme to widen to 12 lanes
the sections of the M25 near Heathrow
Airport, which are the most heavily used
sections of the UK motorway network,
with flows of up to 200,000 vehicles a day.
Private sector finance is playing a role
through ‘Design, Build, Finance and Operate’
(DBFO) contracts, under which the private
sector provides the funding for construction
and maintenance, and receives government
payments linked to usage and performance.
Ten DBFO roads are now open to traffic in
England and five of the Agency’s 37 projects
are part of the DBFO scheme.
Standards
Minimum ages for driving are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
New drivers of motor vehicles must pass
both the practical driving test and a separate
written theory test in order to acquire a full
driving licence. In May 1999 the practical
driving test was lengthened and made tougher,
with the aim of improving the testing of
candidates’ ability to drive in modern traffic
conditions. In 1998, 1.22 million driving tests
were conducted in Great Britain by the
Driving Standards Agency (DSA), the
national driver testing authority. Some 46% of
drivers passed the test, raising the number of
holders of a car full driving licence to about 31
million. The DSA also supervises professional
driving instructors and the compulsory basic
training scheme for learner motorcyclists.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they must meet
safety and environmental requirements, based
primarily on standards drawn up by the
European Union (EU). The Vehicle
Certification Agency is responsible for
ensuring these requirements are met through a
process known as ‘type approval’.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles,
through their annual testing. It also uses
roadside and other enforcement checks to
ensure that drivers and vehicle operators
364
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
comply with legislation. In Northern Ireland
the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles
under statutory schemes broadly similar to
those in Great Britain.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate for adults in the EU.
In 1998, 3,421 deaths occurred in road
accidents in Great Britain, while there were
40,800 serious injuries and nearly 281,000
slight injuries.
Since 1981—85 there has been a significant
decline in deaths and serious casualties, by
39% and 45% respectively, while road traffic
has risen by 55% in this period.
Developments in vehicle safety standards,
better roads, traffic-calming measures (such as
road humps), legislation on seat-belt wearing,
and local safety initiatives (such as 20 mph—
32 km/h—zones) have contributed to this
long-term decline. However, slight injuries
have risen, so that the total of 325,200
casualties in 1998 was 1% more than the
yearly average for 1981-85.
The Government intends to issue a new
road safety strategy in autumn 1999. It wishes
to improve safety for all road users and will set
a target for reducing casualties by 2010. A
review of vehicle speed policy is being
undertaken and is expected to be completed at
about the same time as the new strategy is
published.
Congestion
Traffic congestion in the UK is a serious
problem in many towns and cities in the main
morning and evening peak periods and for
much of the day in inner and central London.
An estimated 1.6 billion hours were lost in
1996 by drivers and passengers on the roads of
Great Britain as a result of congestion, of
which 80% occurred in urban areas.
Traffic management schemes in many
urban areas aim to reduce congestion through
measures such as traffic-free shopping
precincts, bus priority measures (such as bus
lanes and traffic light priority signalling), and
controls on on-street parking. In London a
512-km (318-mile) network of priority ‘red
routes’, with special stopping controls
designed to improve traffic flow, is expected
to be fully operational by 2000.
In June 1999 the first bus lane on a major
motorway in England was opened, a lane
reserved for buses, taxis and coaches on
the London-bound section of the M4 near
Heston.
In 1998 the Government issued a
consultation document, Breaking the Logjam,
setting out its proposals for legislation to allow
local authorities in England and Wales to
introduce charging schemes for road users and
to levy a charge on workplace parking, where
these measures would help to reduce
congestion or traffic growth or achieve other
objectives contained in their local transport
plans. A key feature is that local authorities
would be able to retain all the net revenue
generated from the charges for at least ten
years, provided that these were used to fund
local transport improvements. A similar
consultation document covering Scotland was
published in 1999. The Government is
supporting companies which have adopted
‘green transport’ plans to encourage fewer
staff to travel to work by car and more to use
public transport, cycling, walking, or car¬
sharing arrangements. Leeds and Edinburgh
will host the first full-scale demonstrations of
electronic road user charging equipment in the
UK, starting around the end of 2000.
Traffic Information
The Government is working with interested
parties to ensure that accurate and relevant
traffic information is widely available, both for
pre-trip planning and in-trip purposes.
Traffic information is already provided
throughout Great Britain by a variety of
means, such as the media, roadside signs and
in-vehicle systems. Information originates
from a range of sources, such as roadside
sensors, the traffic police and highway
■
365
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
authorities. It is collated by motoring
organisations, such as the Automobile
Association (AA) and the Royal Automobile
Club (RAC), and by information service
providers, such as Integrated Traffic
Information Services (ITIS), Metro Networks
and Trafficmaster. Local traffic control
centres across Great Britain help to manage
traffic and provide information about traffic
conditions. Centres covering wider areas exist
in Scotland and Wales, and are planned for
England.
Cycling and Walking
Cycling has been declining over a long period,
with mileage travelled now around a fifth of
that in the early 1950s. A National Cycling
Strategy, launched in 1996, aims to double the
number of cycling journeys by 2002 and to
double the level again by 2012. The National
Cycling Forum is co-ordinating its
implementation and the strategy has been
endorsed by the Government. Local
authorities are being encouraged to give
greater priority to cycling and to improve
conditions for cyclists by, for example,
providing designated cycle routes.
The Government is supporting the
National Cycle Network, a linked series of
traffic-free paths and roads with traffic-
calming features, which is being developed by
the transport charity Sustrans to open up new
opportunities for commuter, tourist and
recreational cycling. The first routes, covering
3,500 miles (5,600 kilometres), will be opened
in June 2000, with the network reaching 8,000
miles (12,800 kilometres) by 2005.
People in the UK are walking significantly
less than in the past, with fewer journeys on
foot and many more by car. The Government
wishes to reverse this trend, and is expecting
local authorities to give more priority to
walking by providing, for example, wider
pavements, pedestrianisation schemes, more
direct, safe and convenient routes for walking,
and more pedestrian crossings. The DETR
and the devolved administrations are
monitoring the effectiveness of‘home zones’,
residential streets which have been designed
so that they are primarily places for the local
community to walk and meet, rather than
routes for motor vehicles. Nine such schemes
are being monitored until 2002.
Road Haulage
There are about 113,000 holders of an
operator’s licence (which is required for
operating goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross
weight) in the UK, and 427,000 heavy goods
vehicles. About 88% of operators have fleets
of five or fewer vehicles. Road haulage traffic
by heavy goods vehicles amounted to 152,000
million tonne-kilometres in Great Britain in
1998. Road hauliers have faced greater
competition, especially from hauliers on the
continent of Europe, and are taking steps to
improve efficiency, such as using larger and
more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads—85% of the traffic, in terms of tonne-
kilometres, is now carried by vehicles of over
25 tonnes gross weight. Journey lengths are
increasing, with the average haul now being 93
kilometres (58 miles), 37% longer than in
1980. Hauliers licensed to transport other
firms’ goods account for 75% of freight
carried in terms of tonne-kilometres.
International road haulage has grown
rapidly and in 1998 about 2.1 million road
goods vehicles were ferried to mainland
Europe, of which 544,000 were powered
vehicles registered in the UK. In 1998 UK
vehicles carried 15.5 million tonnes
internationally, and about 96% of this traffic
was with the EU.
In March 1999 the Government issued a
UK strategy on the sustainable distribution of
goods and services (see p. 315). It will
investigate with the road haulage industry how
to maximise the efficiency of freight
movements and to promote the integration of
transport (such as greater use of freight
interchanges) and the consolidation of loads.
The general maximum weight in the UK
for articulated vehicles with five or more axles
rose from 38 tonnes to 40 tonnes in January
1999 to conform with EU requirements. At
the same time, as an incentive to hauliers to
purchase vehicles causing less road damage,
the Government allowed 41-tonne lorries with
six axles, which cause less wear to roads and
bridges than 40-tonne, five-axle vehicles. The
Government has ask€d the Commission for
366
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Integrated Transport to consider the case for a
general increase in the maximum weight for
six-axle lorries to 44 tonnes.
Bus Services
In 1997—98 some 4,337 million passenger
journeys were made on local bus services in
Great Britain, similar to the level in 1996-97
but 18% fewer than in 1987-88. Usage has
been declining in nearly all areas, although in
London (which accounts for nearly a third of
bus journeys in Great Britain) bus patronage
has risen. There are around 76,200 buses and
coaches in Great Britain, of which 32% are
minibuses or midibuses (which are becoming
more widespread) and 22% double-deckers
(which have fallen in number). Operators are
increasing investment, which is now about
£270 million a year, involving the purchase of
around 7,300 new buses. A number of these
are low-floor with easy access, which helps
groups such as shoppers, the elderly and
people in wheelchairs.
Most local bus services are provided
commercially, with 85% of bus mileage
outside London operated on this basis. Local
authorities may subsidise services which are
not commercially viable but are considered
socially necessary. Support for bus travel in
Great Britain is almost £1 billion a year,
including over £440 million on concessionary
fares (such as for the elderly) and £220 million
on the purchase of additional non-commercial
bus services.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by companies in the private sector,
apart from 17 bus companies owned by local
authorities. London Transport (LT), a
statutory corporation, is responsible for
providing or procuring public transport in
London. It oversees about 700 bus routes run
by private sector companies under contract.
Following a series of mergers and
takeovers, five main groups now operate bus
services: Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead
Group, National Express and Stagecoach.
These have become substantial
undertakings—for example, FirstGroup has
over 20 separate bus operations, with a fleet of
9,000 vehicles. Most of these groups have
diversified into running other transport
services, such as rail services and airports,
while some have also expanded into transport
services in other countries. For example,
National Express has become the third largest
operator of school bus services in the United
States, and Stagecoach is to buy Coach USA,
the largest US charter and tour coach
operator.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are operated by subsidiaries
of the publicly owned Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company (NITHC),
collectively known as ‘Translink’. Citybus Ltd
operates services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd
runs most of the services in the rest of
Northern Ireland, carrying respectively 22
million and 50 million passengers a year.
Future Developments
In March 1999 the Government issued a
strategy for supporting the development of
bus services in Great Britain, which will
feature prominently in the new local transport
plans and strategies (see p. 362). The
Government will be providing statutory
backing for ‘quality partnerships’, which will
be developed by local authorities and bus
operators in the context of these plans.
Partnerships have been developed in over 30
towns and cities, including Aberdeen,
Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds, Oxford and
Swansea. These have led to better services
with higher-quality buses, with examples of
increased patronage of 10% to 20%.
Partnerships have also been successful in
rural areas, such as around Pwllheli in north
Wales, where, as a result, bus patronage has
risen by 22% in two years. Extra funding of
around £170 million over three years is being
provided to rural bus services in the UK, and
a ‘rural bus challenge’ has been held in
England to stimulate the development of
innovative services in rural areas.
Other features of the Government’s
strategy include:
• measures to promote stability in services,
for example by reducing frequent
timetable changes;
367
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• improving information for bus
passengers and giving local authorities a
statutory duty to ensure bus information
is available in their areas;
• improved ticketing arrangements, such as
tickets covering both buses and trains;
• minimum standards for concessionary
fares; and
• new powers for local authorities to
arrange the provision of extra services.
A new £50 million ‘guided’ busway (with
buses travelling on segregated track) is to
be built in Edinburgh to link the airport to
the city centre. The project is being
undertaken by a consortium involving
FirstGroup and the construction group
Balfour Beatty.
Coaches
Coaches account for much of the non-local
mileage operated by public service vehicles—
this rose by about 4% in 1997—98 to 1,559
million vehicle-kilometres. Organised coach
tours and holiday journeys account for about
60% of coach travel in Great Britain. High-
frequency scheduled services, run by private
sector operators, link many towns and cities.
About 20,000 people use coaches to commute
into and out of London each weekday, and
commuter services also operate into some
other major centres. The biggest coach
operator, National Express, has a national
network of routes and in 1998 carried 17
million passengers on its UK express coach
and airport coach services linking 1,200
destinations.
Taxis
There are about 55,300 licensed taxis in England
and Wales, mainly in urban areas, around 8,500
in Scotland, and about 7,000 in Northern
Ireland. In London (which has around 19,400
taxis) and several other major cities, taxis must
be purpose-built to conform to strict
requirements. In many districts, taxi drivers
have to pass a test of their knowledge of the area.
Private hire vehicles with drivers
(‘minicabs’) may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street. In most
areas outside London, private hire vehicles are
licensed; there are about 66,000 in England and
Wales outside the capital. It is estimated that at
least 60,000 minicabs operate in the London
area. The Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act
1998 provides the basis for regulating minicab
operators, drivers and vehicles. In May 1999
the Government issued a consultation paper on
the details for operator licensing in London,
while further consultation papers are planned
on driver and vehicle licensing.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power.
Privatisation of railway services in Great Britain
was completed in 1997. The main system now
involves Railtrack, which is responsible for
operating all track and infrastructure; three
rolling stock companies, which lease
locomotives and passenger carriages; 25
passenger train operating companies; four
freight service providers; and a number of
infrastructure maintenance companies.
Rail Regulation
The Government wishes to see tighter
regulation of the railway industry. It has
therefore introduced into Parliament the
Railways Bill, which will establish a Strategic
Rail Authority (SRA) to support the
Government’s integrated transport policy.
The Authority would subsume OPRAF (the
Office of Passenger Rail Franchising) and the
British Railways Board. The two bodies are
currently operating as the Shadow Strategic
Rail Authority (SSRA)—until the Bill is
enacted—and are developing a strategic plan
for the railways, covering both passenger and
freight services.
The SSRA is also responsible for
negotiating, awarding and monitoring the
franchises for operating rail services. Most
franchises last seven years, but some are for up
to 15 years in return for increased investment
368
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
commitments. Each agreement specifies
provisions governing the contractual level of
passenger services to be provided by the
operator, for example, on the frequency of
trains and stations served, and, in general,
provides for gradually reducing subsidies to
the franchisee. Support for passenger rail
services amounted to £1.2 billion in 1998-99.
There is also the Office of the Rail
Regulator, which licenses the railway
operators, deals with agreements governing
access by operators to track and stations, and
promotes rail users’ interests. It sponsors a
network of statutory rail users’ consultative
committees which represent the interests of
passengers. These committees and the
Regulator’s role in promoting rail users’
interests, will transfer to the SRA. In addition,
the Office of the International Rail Regulator
has responsibilities for licensing the operation
of certain international rail services in the
European Economic Area, and for access to
the railway infrastructure in Great Britain for
the operation of such services.
In February 1999 a National Rail Summit
was held, with representatives from
government, the rail industry and
passengers. A package of measures was
agreed to improve the quality of rail
services and tackle some of the problems
affecting the railways (such as late-running
services and overcrowding), including:
• the acquisition of 2,300 new vehicles,
so that by 2002 half the passenger
rolling stock will be new or
refurbished;
• investment of £39 million in
improving passenger information
systems in stations; and
• measures to improve passenger
security.
In addition, the Government announced
plans for tougher performance measures,
and a new National Passenger Survey later
in 1999. It also indicated that it would be
prepared to consider renegotiation of
franchises if operators guaranteed to
deliver improved services.
Railtrack
Railtrack owns and manages the rail
infrastructure in Great Britain. Assets include
32,000 kilometres (20,000 miles) of track;
40,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts; 2,500
stations; and connections to over 1,000 freight
terminals. Apart from 14 major stations
operated directly by the company, nearly all
stations and depots are leased to the train
operating companies. Turnover in 1998-99
totalled £2.6 billion, of which 92%
represented payments by passenger and
freight train operators for access to the rail
network.
Railtrack plans to invest £27 billion in the
rail network in the ten years from 1999: £16.4
billion on renewing and maintaining existing
infrastructure and £10.7 billion on schemes to
enhance the network. Major projects include
modernising the West Coast and East Coast
main lines, the Thameslink 2000 project to
increase the capacity of north-south services
through London, and improved rail links to
airports (such as Heathrow and Stansted).
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
services in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and the South East. About
18,000 scheduled services operate each day.
Some 890 million passenger journeys were
made on the rail network in 1998-99, 5%
more than in 1997-98.
Passenger services (other than Eurostar
services—see pp. 370-1—and the Heathrow
Express) are run under franchise by 25 train
operating companies. Bus and coach operator
National Express has the largest number of
franchises—five. Other main operators
include Connex (which is French-owned and
has two franchises running commuter services
in the South East), Virgin, Prism and
Stagecoach. The companies lease their rolling
stock from the three rolling stock companies:
Angel Train Contracts, Forward Trust and
Porterbrook Leasing (a subsidiary of
Stagecoach). BAA (see p. 376) runs the
369
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Heathrow Express, between Heathrow
Airport and Paddington in central London.
Investment
Train operating companies are placing
substantial orders for new or refurbished
passenger trains. Virgin Rail has ordered 55
new high-speed tilting trains to run at speeds
of up to 140 miles per hour (225 km/h) on the
West Coast main line between London and
Glasgow, the first of which will enter service
in 2001, and 74 high-speed diesel trains for its
cross-country routes. Many other companies
have placed substantial orders for new trains.
The Government has made available from
April 1999 two new investment funds:
• the Rail Passenger Partnership scheme,
which is designed to encourage
innovative rail services at local and
regional levels; and
• the Infrastructure Investment Fund,
which is supporting projects to tackle
bottlenecks in the rail network.
Freight
Rail freight traffic is relatively constant
following a long-term decline. In 1998-99
traffic totalled 102 million tonnes. Over 80%
of traffic by volume is of bulk commodities,
mainly coal, coke, iron and steel, building
materials and petroleum. The two largest
operators are English, Welsh & Scottish
Railway (EWS), which also runs trains
through the Channel 4 unnel to the continent
of Europe; and Freightliner, which operates
container services between major ports and
inland terminals.
The Government is keen to encourage
more freight to be moved by rail, to relieve
pressure on the road network and to bring
environmental benefits; grants are available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than by road. It has endorsed the
expansion targets of the main operators. The
freight operators are investing £600 million in
the next four years in new locomotives and
freight wagons. In 1998 EWS opened the first
commercial ‘piggyback’ service in the UK,
carrying lorry trailers on specially designed
rail wagons between Mossend (near Glasgow)
and Willesden in London. Other investment
plans include a £15 million Freightliner
terminal at Westloog, near Cardiff, and a £200
million scheme for a railfreight terminal, the
London International Freight Exchange,
which has been proposed for a site near
Heathrow Airport.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
NITHC (see p. 367), operates the railway
service on about 336 kilometres (211 miles) of
track and handled 6 million passenger
journeys in 1998—99. The Belfast to Dublin
service has been upgraded, with new track and
rolling stock, and a major track upgrade
programme is planned for the rest of the rail
network in the Province.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe financed by the
private sector, was opened to traffic in 1994. It
cost about £10 billion and was undertaken by
Eurotunnel, a British-French group, under an
operating concession from the British and
French governments.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates a drive-on, drive-off
shuttle train service, with separate shuttles for
passenger and freight vehicles, between
terminals near Folkestone and Calais. At peak
periods there are up to four passenger shuttles
and up to four freight shuttles an hour in each
direction. In 1998 the service took 52% of car
traffic, 39% of coach traffic and 37% of
freight traffic on the Dover/Folkestone—
Calais route.
Eurostar Passenger Services
Eurostar high-speed train services are
operated jointly by Eurostar (UK) Ltd,
370
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
French Railways and Belgian Railways. Up to
32 Eurostar services run daily in each
direction through the Channel Tunnel
between London (Waterloo) and Paris or
Brussels, taking less than 3 hours and 2 hours
40 minutes respectively. Trains also serve
Ashford (Kent), Calais, Lille, Disneyland
Paris and, during the winter months, Bourg St
Maurice in the French Alps. Eurostar handled
6.3 million passengers in 1998.
Construction work has started on the first
stage of the high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail
Link, costing some £4.2 billion, following the
completion of a Public-Private Partnership
refinancing deal agreed between the
Government, London & Continental Railways
(LCR—the consortium selected to design,
build and operate the Link) and Railtrack. As
a result, Railtrack and Bechtel (of the United
States) will manage the construction on LCR’s
behalf. Railtrack will purchase the first stage,
from the Channel Tunnel to Fawkham
Junction in north-west Kent, when it is
completed in 2003. A government guarantee
now underpins bond finance for the project,
while LCR’s concession has been reduced, so
that the railway, including Eurostar, will
revert to public ownership in 2086, at around
the same time as the Eurotunnel concession.
Initial preparatory work has begun on the
second stage, from Fawkham Junction to St
Pancras (London), which is due for
completion by 2007.
Other Railways in London
London Underground Ltd, a subsidiary of
LT, operates services on 391 kilometres (243
miles) of railway, of which about 171
kilometres (106 miles) are underground. The
system, the oldest in the world, has 268
stations, with 489 trains running in the peak
period. Around 866 million passenger
journeys were made on London Underground
trains in 1998—99. In May 1999 the first stage
of the £3.2 billion extension of the Jubilee
Line was opened, and the remaining stages of
the extension, which will provide a fast link
from central London to Stratford (east
London) via Docklands and the Millennium
Dome site at North Greenwich, are due to
open by the end of 1999.
The Government has announced plans for
a new Public-Private Partnership for the
Underground, under which the private sector
will be invited to undertake a £7 billion
investment programme. Railtrack will enter
into negotiations to take over the sub-surface
lines and will possibly work with London
Underground on a proposal to link these lines
to the national rail network. Two other private
sector contracts will be awarded to maintain
and modernise the rest of the Underground’s
infrastructure and rolling stock. London
Underground will continue to operate the
services as a public sector body.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR)
connects Docklands with the City of London,
Beckton and Stratford. It is operated under
franchise by Docklands Railway Management
Ltd, owned by Serco Group pic. A £200
million extension to Greenwich and
Lewisham is due to open by January 2000,
which will extend the network to 26
kilometres (16 miles) with 36 stations. A link
to London City Airport is to be opened by
2004, and an extension to North Woolwich is
under consideration.
The Croydon Tramlink, a 28-km (18-mile)
light rail network in south London, running
partly along existing and disused railway track
and partly along or beside roads, is due to
open by the end of 1999. Tramtrack Croydon
Ltd (a private sector consortium) is building
and will operate the network, as a joint
undertaking with LT.
Other Railways and Tramways
Four other light rail systems are in operation:
the Tyne and Wear Metro, Manchester
Metrolink, South Yorkshire Supertram and the
Midland Metro. The first stage of the Midland
Metro, between Birmingham and
Wolverhampton, was opened in May 1999, and
two extensions are under consideration. More
light rail schemes have been proposed, but the
Government has indicated that light rail is likely
to be a cost-effective option in only a few places,
as in the case of the 13-km (8-mile) Nottingham
Express Transit system which will link Hucknall
to the centre of Nottingham from 2002.
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
371
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
loop in central Glasgow. Traditional trams
still operate in Blackpool and Llandudno.
Over 100 other passenger-carrying
railways, many concerned with the
preservation of steam locomotives, are to be
found throughout Great Britain. Most are
operated on a voluntary basis and provide
limited services for tourists and railway
enthusiasts. They generally run on former
branch lines, but there are also several narrow-
gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for leisure boating
and general recreation, as well as playing a
significant role nationally as a focus for
regeneration, in land drainage and water supply,
and for freight-carrying. Most waterways are
now used primarily for leisure. Research
indicates that the canals are visited by 10 million
people a year, representing 160 million visits, of
which 90% are by sightseers and walkers.
British Waterways, a public corporation
sponsored by the DETR, manages 3,200
kilometres (2,000 miles) of waterways, making
up the greater part of the canal and navigable
river system in Great Britain.
The Government is keen to see greater use
of waterways. In February 1999 it
announced a series of measures to help
British Waterways further develop the
canals. These included:
• an increase in grant, by £8 million to
nearly £59 million a year, to enable
British Waterways to deal with a
backlog of maintenance work;
• proposals for British Waterways to
collaborate with the private sector on
developing Public-Private Partnerships
in its property, water transfer and
maintenance operations, and to
collaborate with local authorities and
other public sector partners on local
canal improvements; and
• plans for British Waterways to
consult on a membership scheme
linked to a charitable trust.
The DETR is encouraging more passenger
and freight transport on the inland
waterways, including the development of
river services to the millennium celebrations
at Greenwich (see p. ix) as a means of
revitalising passenger transport on the
Thames. Two operators will run river
transport services and invest £6 million in
new vessels, while £15 million is being
invested in new and upgraded piers.
Several stretches of canal are being
restored. One example is the £78 million
Millennium Link project (see p. xii) to
connect again Glasgow and Edinburgh by
canal; British Waterways is working in a
partnership consortium of public sector and
voluntary bodies.
SHIPPING
The UK accounts for 6% of world merchant
shipping; the shipping industry is a major
service-sector exporter and supports a wide
range of shore-based, maritime-related
facilities in the City of London and elsewhere
in the UK. About 95% by weight (75% by
value) of the UK’s foreign trade is carried by
sea. The UK shipping fleet contains a number
of world-leading operations in sectors such as
cruising, container services, tanker and dry
bulk carriers, offshore support and other
specialist activities. Nevertheless, the UK fleet
has declined considerably in tonnage terms in
the last 25 years. This reflects changing trade
patterns, removal of grants, and greater
competition, both from overseas shipping
lines and from ships operating under ‘flags of
convenience’ (open shipping registers which
have no effective national link between the flag
state and the ships on its register, and which
often have less rigorous controls on matters
such as safety standards).
At the end of 1998 there were 616 UK-
owned merchant trading ships of 100 gross
tonnes or more, with a total tonnage of 9.8
million deadweight tonnes. There were 159
vessels totalling 4.4 million deadweight tonnes
used as oil, chemical or gas carriers, and 457
vessels totalling 5.3 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship. In all, 72% of
UK-owned vessels (68% by tonnage) are
372
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
registered in the UK or British Overseas
Territories such as Bermuda.
In December 1998 the Government
announced a series of measures for reviving
the shipping industry and reversing the
downward trend in the UK fleet. The
implementation of these measures, announced
in August 1999, includes:
• a new, more attractive fiscal regime,
under which shipping would be taxed on
the basis of tonnage, as has been adopted
by a number of other countries;
• more training and career opportunities
for seafarers, and a new ‘minimum
training obligation’, involving a formal
commitment by shipping companies to
train seafarers as a condition of owners’
eligibility for the new tax on tonnage; and
• a new role for the Maritime and
Coastguard Agency (see below) in
promoting the use of the British flag
alongside its existing role of maintaining
the high standards of the UK register.
Cargo Services
International revenue earned by the UK
shipping industry in 1998 was £3.5 billion:
£2.8 billion from freight—£2.3 billion on dry
cargo and passenger vessels and £531 million
on tankers and liquefied gas carriers—£179
million from charter receipts and £462 million
from passenger revenue.
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services
from the UK are containerised. British
tonnage serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of companies. P&O
Nedlloyd (owned by P&O and Royal Nedlloyd
of the Netherlands) is among the three largest
container carriers in the world. Besides the
carriage of freight by liner and bulk services
between the UK and the rest of Europe, many
roll-on, roll-off services carry cars, passengers
and commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
Around 53 million passenger journeys a year
take place on international and domestic ferry
services linking the UK with Ireland and with
mainland Europe. Domestic passenger and
freight ferry services run to many of Britain’s
offshore islands, such as the Isle of Wight,
Orkney and Shetland, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland. Traffic from southern
and south-eastern ports accounts for a large
proportion of traffic to the continent.
P&O European Ferries is the largest ferry
operator in north-west Europe, with a fleet of
51 ships operating on 22 routes around the
UK. Two 60,600-tonne ferries, the largest in
the world, have been ordered for the Hull to
Rotterdam route from 2001. Cross-Channel
services are operated by roll-on, roll-off
ferries, hovercraft (run by Hoverspeed), high¬
speed catamarans and high-speed monohulls.
Capacity has been reduced following the
merger in 1998 of P&O’s cross-Channel
operations with those of Stena Line to form
P&O Stena Line.
P&O Cruises Ltd is one of the three leading
cruise operators in the world. In 1998 P&O’s
US cruise subsidiary, Princess Cruises,
handled 4.4 million passengers and took
delivery of the then world’s largest cruise ship,
the 109,000-tonne Grand Princess.
Maritime Safety
The DETR’s policies for improving marine
safety and pollution control are implemented
by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency,
which inspects UK ships and foreign ships
using UK ports to ensure that they comply
with international safety, pollution prevention
and operational standards. In 1998, 169
overseas-registered ships were detained in
UK ports.
In 1998 HM Coastguard co-ordinated
action in 11,553 incidents (including cliff
rescues), in which 14,366 people were helped.
In an emergency it co-ordinates facilities, such
as its own helicopters; cliff rescue companies;
lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body); aircraft,
helicopters and ships from the armed forces;
and merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
Some locations around the UK are
potentially hazardous for shipping. Measures
to reduce the risk of collision include the
separation of ships into internationally agreed
373
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
shipping lanes, as applies in the Dover Strait,
one of the world’s busiest seaways, which is
monitored by radar from the Channel
Navigation Information Service near Dover.
There are over 1,000 marine aids to navigation
around the UK coast and responsibility for
these rests with the general lighthouse
authorities: Trinity House Lighthouse Service
(for England and Wales), the Northern
Lighthouse Board (for Scotland and the Isle of
Man) and the Commissioners of Irish Lights
(which covers the whole of Ireland).
In 1998 a new EC directive was agreed
requiring roll-on, roll-off ferries to undergo
safety checks before entering service and to
carry voyage data recorders (‘black boxes’).
PORTS
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation.
There are three broad types of port: over 90
trust ports owned and run by boards
constituted as trusts; those owned by local
authorities (predominantly small ports, but
including a few larger ones, such as Sullom
Voe and Portsmouth); and company-owned
facilities. Major ports controlled by trusts
include Aberdeen, Dover, Milford Haven and
Tyne.
Associated British Ports (ABP) is the UK’s
largest port owner and operates 23 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Ipswich, Newport, Southampton and
Swansea. Altogether they handled 122 million
tonnes of cargo in 1998, when ABP invested
£46 million in its ports and transport business.
Other major facilities owned by private sector
companies include Felixstowe, Harwich and
Thamesport (all owned by the Hong Kong
group Hutchison Whampoa), Clyde, Forth,
Liverpool, Medway and Manchester.
The Government intends to issue a paper
on UK ports policy, which will involve a
greater role for ports in the promotion of
environmentally sustainable transport and
the regeneration of local communities, and
reflect its view that all ports should be
publicly accountable for their statutory
powers and duties. Responses to a separate
consultation paper on trust ports are under
consideration.
Port Traffic
In 1998 traffic through major UK ports (those
handling over 2 million tonnes a year)
amounted to 530 million tonnes: 173 million
tonnes of exports, 198 million tonnes of
imports and 159 million tonnes of domestic
traffic (which included offshore traffic and
landings of sea-dredged aggregates). Minor
ports handled an additional 38 million tonnes.
The UK’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are shown in Table 22.3.
Forth, Milford Haven and Sullom Voe
(Shetland) mostly handle oil, while the
principal destinations for non-fuel traffic are

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
London, Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham,
Tees and Hartlepool, and Liverpool.
Container and roll-on, roll-off traffic in the
UK was 133 million tonnes in 1998 and now
accounts for 71% of non-bulk traffic. By far
the most important port for container traffic is
Felixstowe (which handles 42%), followed by
London (11%) and Southampton (9%).
Dover is the leading port for roll-on, roll-off
traffic. It is also the major arrival and
departure point, handling around half of
international sea passenger movements to and
? from the UK.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at
Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint. Belfast handles over 60% of
Northern Ireland’s seaborne trade.
CIVIL AVIATION
UK airlines are entirely in the private sector,
as are many of the major airports. Air traffic is
continuing to grow rapidly. In 1998 UK
airlines flew a record 1.3 billion aircraft
kilometres, 71% higher than in 1988: 886
million kilometres on scheduled services and
410 million kilometres on non-scheduled
flights. They carried 62 million passengers on
scheduled services and 31 million on charter
flights. Passenger seat occupancy was 77%,
being much higher on charter flights (90%)
than on scheduled services (71%). It is also
higher for international flights (78%) than
internal services (62%).
The Government wishes to achieve further
liberalisation of international air services in
bilateral negotiations with other countries. A
new policy on airports, covering the next 30
years, is being prepared. Meanwhile, a series
of studies on regional airports is in progress.
Day-to-day responsibility for the regulation
of civil aviation rests with the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA).
Airlines
British Airways
British Airways is the world’s eighth largest
carrier in terms of passengers carried, and the
largest international airline. During 1998-99
its turnover from airline operations was £8.9
billion, and the British Airways group, which
employs over 55,000 people worldwide,
carried 45 million passengers.
The airline’s scheduled route network
serves 168 destinations in 87 countries and its
main operating base is London’s Heathrow
Airport. British Airways has recently formed
the ‘Oneworld’ alliance (the world’s largest
airline alliance, handling over 200 million
passengers a year) with American Airlines,
Canadian International Airlines, Cathay
Pacific and Qantas; three other airlines have
agreed to join the alliance. The British
Airways group has a fleet of 281 aircraft,
including seven Concordes, 59 Boeing 737s,
79 Boeing 747s, 53 Boeing 757s, 28 Boeing
767s and 26 Boeing 777s. It is acquiring 39
Airbus A319s, the first of which will be
delivered in October 1999. British Airways has
adopted a new fleet strategy, concentrating on
profitable business while reducing capacity on
less profitable services.
Other UK Airlines
British Midland is the second largest scheduled
carrier and operates an extensive network of
scheduled services with 37 aircraft, which
carried 6 million passengers in 1998. Britannia
Airways is the world’s biggest charter airline
and carried 8.2 million passengers in 1998 on
its 36 aircraft. Virgin Atlantic operates
scheduled services to 15 overseas destinations
with 25 aircraft, and in May 1999 launched a
new service to Shanghai. Low-fare, ‘no-frills’
airlines are expanding their services; operators
in the UK include Easyjet and the British
Airways subsidiary Go.
Airports
Of over 150 licensed civil aerodromes in the
UK, nearly one-quarter handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. In 1998 the
UK’s civil airports handled a total of 143.4
million passengers (142.2 million terminal
passengers and nearly 1.3 million in transit),
and 2.0 million tonnes of freight.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international travellers and is the UK’s most
important for passengers and air freight,

handling 60.4 million passengers (excluding
those in transit) and 1.2 million tonnes of
freight in 1998. Gatwick is also one of the
world’s busiest international airports and has
the world’s busiest single runway.
Ownership and Control
BAA pic is the world’s largest commercial
operator of airports. In the UK it owns and
operates seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted and Southampton in southern
England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Aberdeen in Scotland—which handled 112.5
million passengers in 1998-99. Overseas, BAA
manages all or part of eight airports: four in
the United States, Naples Airport in Italy,
Melbourne and Launceston airports in
Australia, and Mauritius. It also manages
commercial facilities at its airports, and is a
major international duty-free retailer.
The UK’s second largest operator is TBI,
which controls Belfast International and
Cardiff. In May 1999 it acquired Airport
Group International, so that it now has an
interest in 29 airports worldwide. Manchester
and Newcastle airports are among those
owned by local authorities.
All UK airports used for public transport
and training flights must be licensed by the
CAA for reasons of safety. Stringent
requirements, such as adequate fire-fighting,
medical and rescue services, have to be
satisfied before a licence is granted. Strict
security measures are in force at UK
terminals; these were tightened in May 1999
following a review of airport security.
Regulations require airlines to account for,
and authorise for carriage, every item of hold
baggage placed on board international flights
originating in the UK.
Airport Development
At Heathrow, BAA has put forward plans for
a fifth terminal, which could eventually cater
for 30 million passengers a year. A planning
inquiry into the proposals was concluded in
spring 1999. If approval is granted, the new
terminal could be operational by 2006.
Connections to Heathrow have been improved
following the opening in 1998 of the £450
million Heathrow Express rail link to central
London. BAA is planning to invest over £200
million at Stansted in the next five years to
increase its capacity to around 15 million
passengers a year, and £100 million a year
over the next ten years at Gatwick, mainly to
expand terminal facilities and raise annual
capacity to around 40 million passengers.
Full-scale redevelopment of the passenger
terminal at Edinburgh Airport is in progress.
Among other large-scale improvements at UK
airports are:
376
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
• a second runway at Manchester Airport,
the first full-length runway to be built in
the UK for 20 years, which is expected to
open in 2000;
• a £37 million investment programme to
provide a new terminal at Bristol Airport;
and
• a £30 million expansion scheme at
Belfast City Airport.
Air Traffic Control
Civil and military air traffic control over the
UK and the surrounding seas, including much
of the North Atlantic, is undertaken by
National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS, a
subsidiary of the CAA), working in
collaboration with military controllers. Air
traffic control facilities are expanding to meet
the continuing growth in air traffic. All civil
and military en route air traffic control
operations in the UK will eventually be
concentrated at two sites:
• a new air traffic control centre, at
Swanwick (Hampshire), which will
handle traffic over England and Wales
and is expected to open in 2002; and
• a new Scottish centre at Prestwick, which
will handle traffic over Scotland and
Northern Ireland and replace the existing
Prestwick centre in 2005-06.
The Government has announced a new
Public-Private Partnership for NATS,
involving the sale of 51% to the private sector,
to help finance further investment and improve
passenger safety. Air safety regulation,
however, will remain with the CAA.
Air Safety
The CAA imposes very high safety standards
on UK airlines. It certifies aircraft and air
crews, licenses air operators and air travel
organisers, and approves certain air fares and
airport charges. To qualify for a first
professional licence, a pilot must undertake a
full-time course of instruction approved by
the CAA—or have acceptable military or
civilian flying experience—and pass ground
examinations and flight tests. Every company
operating aircraft used for commercial air
transport purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which the CAA grants
when it is satisfied that the company is
competent to operate its aircraft safely. All
aircraft registered in the UK must be granted
a certificate of airworthiness by the CAA
before being flown.
The CAA works closely with the Joint
Aviation Authorities (JAA), a European
grouping of aviation safety regulation
authorities. The Government and the CAA
support the concept of a new European
Aviation Safety Authority, which would build
on the work of the JAA.
The DETR’s Air Accidents Investigation
Branch investigates accidents and serious
incidents occurring in UK airspace and those
that happen overseas to aircraft registered or
manufactured in the UK.
Communications
Telecommunications is one of the most
rapidly expanding sectors of the UK economy.
Growth has been particularly strong in new
services, such as those provided over the
Internet—there are an estimated 7 million
users in the UK. A report for the Department
of Trade and Industry found that business use
of the Internet grew by 27% in 1998; 51% of
UK companies have their own website; 72%
use electronic mail; and usage of e-mail rose
by 24% in 1998. Postal services remain
important, and the volume of conventional
mail continues to increase.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
The UK was one of the first countries to
introduce competition in its
telecommunications network, when British
Telecom (BT) became a private sector
company in 1984. Britain now has one of the
world’s most open telecommunications
markets, with nearly 400 licences issued to
more than 300 different providers.
Services
Effective competition exists in most large
urban areas of the UK, as new fixed link
377
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
operators have extended their networks,
resulting in a wider choice of supplier for
users and lower prices. Competitors to BT
have increased their share of the market,
especially the business market (see Table
22.5). Cable companies now have 21% of the
business market in international calls and
other companies 42%, with BT’s share 37%.
Telephone traffic has been rising quickly,
with calls from fixed links growing by 14% a
year, stimulated by price cuts and greater
marketing by operators. Calls to mobile
telephones in particular are growing rapidly,
by over 50% a year. Exchange lines are
continuing to increase, with business exchange
lines rising at a faster rate than residential
lines. BT still has a relatively high proportion
of exchange lines—85% of residential lines
and nearly 90% of business lines. However,
cable operators are gaining customers in the
residential market and among small
businesses. There are around 16 million
mobile telephone users, about 70% more than
in 1998.
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL)
OFTEL, a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory
body for the telecommunications industry. It
is headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions
include:
• ensuring that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• promoting effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• providing advice to the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry on
telecommunications matters; and
• investigating complaints against public
telecommunications operators.
Rapid developments in the sector are
changing the emphasis of OFTEL’s work. It is
moving away from detailed regulation in basic
domestic telecommunications services and
looking to ensure that competition applies in

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
international and mobile services, and to
considering the effects of the convergence of
the telecommunications and broadcasting
sectors.
Service Providers
BT
BT is currently the UK’s biggest
telecommunications company, with a turnover
in 1998-99 of £18.2 billion. It runs one of the
world’s largest public telecommunications
networks, including over 20 million residential
lines and 8 million business lines (see Table
22.5). It has 7,500 local telephone exchanges,
69 main switching units, and over 142,000
public payphones, and employs 124,700
people. Originally BT handled mainly fixed-
voice telephone calls, but its traffic in data
communications—including e-mail, the
Internet and electronic commerce—is growing
by over 30% a year and now exceeds voice
traffic on its network. BT is planning
investment of £5 billion in data and
multimedia services.
BT has extensive international interests
through its ‘Concert’ operation. Concert
Communications Services has over 4,700
major corporate customers in 52 countries. In
1998 BT and AT&T (one of the largest
telecommunications companies in the United
States) announced their intention to create a
joint venture combining their international
assets, network and traffic (including the
Concert services), which would serve 237
countries and territories. The new venture is
expected to begin operating later in 1999 if
regulatory approval is received.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic has operations in 50
countries and employs over 50,000 people.
Turnover in 1998—99 (excluding associated
companies and joint ventures) was £7.9
billion, of which 32% came from its interests
in Hong Kong. Around 73% of its revenue
comes from business customers, and in 1999
the company adopted a new strategy to
concentrate on the business sector, especially
in data, Internet and other advanced services;
revenue from these services is growing by
30% a year. It has recently acquired the
Internet assets of the US telecommunications
company MCI, giving it a leading position in
the US Internet market, as well as acquiring
the Japanese international communications
company IDC. It has also sold its submarine
cable laying and maintenance business, and
has agreed to sell its interest in the One 2 One
mobile telephone operator. It has announced
additional capital expenditure, including £610
million over three years to build a fully
integrated voice and data network linking over
40 cities in Europe and £410 million on
developing its US Internet network.
In the UK, Cable and Wireless pic has a
53% stake in Cable & Wireless
Communications, currently the largest
provider of integrated communications and
television services in the UK. Under a deal
reached with NTL in July 1999, the operations
of Cable & Wireless Communications will be
split probably early in 2000, with Cable and
Wireless pic acquiring full ownership of
business services operations; currently Cable &
Wireless Communications provides services to
over 150,000 business customers, while 1.1
million residential homes take direct telephony
or cable television from the company. NTL
will acquire the residential business of Cable &
Wireless Communications.
Vodafone AirTouch
Vodafone AirTouch is the UK’s biggest
mobile telephone operator, with over a third of
the market. It was formed in 1999 following a
takeover by Vodafone of the US mobile
telephone group AirTouch. The new
company, with over 23 million subscribers in
23 countries, has become the largest mobile
telecommunications company in the world.
Other Operators
Other public telecommunications operators
include:
• COLT Telecom, which has high-
capacity optical fibre networks in 19
major European cities in nine countries;
379
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• Energis, which is concentrating on
enhanced voice and advanced data
services, with a network of over 6,500
kilometres (4,040 miles) across the
National Grid electricity transmission
infrastructure;
• Kingston Communications, the long-
established network operator for the
Kingston upon Hull area—it was floated
on the London Stock Exchange in July
1999, with the local council retaining a
minority stake; and
• ScottishTelecom, a division of
ScottishPower.
Following a substantial consolidation among
the cable operators, the three main companies
are currently Cable & Wireless
Communications (see p. 379), Telewest and
NTL. By the end of 1998 cable operators had
installed around 4.3 million telephone lines in
the UK, and 12 million homes were able to
receive broadband cable services.
Mobile Communications
Around a quarter of people in the UK have a
mobile telephone. Mobile telephone usage is
continuing to grow strongly, helped recently
by rising sales of pre-paid schemes, under
which customers pay for their calls in advance
by purchasing vouchers. Vodafone AirTouch
and BT Cellnet are the two largest operators,
with 6 million and 4.8 million subscribers
respectively.
The UK was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
digital services. The two PCN operators are
Orange, with 2.8 million customers, and
One 2 One (which, it was announced in
August 1999, is to be acquired by Deutsche
Telekom from Cable and \\ ireless and
MediaOne of the US), with 2.5 million
subscribers. Early in 2000 the Government
will offer for sale by auction licences to run the
third generation of mobile telephones, which
will provide high-speed access to a large
number of entertainment and information
services. Five licences will be auctioned, with
one reserved for a new entrant to the market.
Dolphin Telecommunications is due to
launch later in 1999 the first mobile telephone
network using the TETRA technology, which
enhances the variety and quality of available
services, including advanced speech and data
facilities, and greater security.
Other licences awarded include four to
operate national paging networks and four to
run mobile data networks.
Internet Service Providers
There are around 300 Internet service
providers (ISPs) in the UK offering access to
the Internet. Internet use has recently been
stimulated by the arrival in the market of ISPs
offering free access to the Internet. The
biggest ISP is Freeserve, which was launched
by the retailer Dixons in 1998 and has some
1.3 million users.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail. Today, its Royal Mail
service delivers to 26 million addresses in the
UK, handling 77 million letters each working
day. In 1998-99 it processed 18.1 billion
inland letters and 873 million outgoing
international letters. Mail is collected from
112,000 posting boxes, and from post offices
and large postal users. The Post Office
employs 201,000 people.
The postal market is undergoing rapid
change. In a White Paper (see Further
Reading), issued in July 1999, the
Government set out its plans to transform the
Post Office and the postal market in the UK.
The measures give the Post Office greater
commercial freedom to operate at arm’s length
from the Government and to invest in new
business opportunities. The new freedoms are
part of a package of measures which also
includes the introduction of greater
competition and tough new regulation to
promote the interests of consumers and ensure
fair competition. The new regulator—the
Postal Services Commission—will take up its
duties on 1 April 2000. One of its first tasks
will be to consider the effects of a reduction in
the Post Office’s current monopoly on letters
380
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
and packets costing less than or weighing
less than 350g, and to make recommendations
to the Government on an appropriate
threshold.
Royal Mail has invested substantially in the
latest mail-sorting technology. High-speed
mail-handling machinery—the Integrated
Mail Processor—should enable automatic
handling of 90% of letter mail by 2000.
Automatic sorting utilises the information
contained in the postcode; the UK postcode
system is one of the most sophisticated in the
world, allowing mechanised sorting down to
part of a street on a postman’s round and, in
some cases, to an individual address (see map
opposite p. 5).
International Services, part of the Post
Office, has its own mail-handling centre at
Heathrow, which handles about four-fifths of
outward airmail. It uses 1,400 flights a week to
send mail direct to over 300 destinations
worldwide. Taking advantage of its new
commercial freedoms, the Post Office is
already expanding overseas, through the
acquisition earlier in 1999 of German Parcel,
the third largest private carrier in Germany.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions, with a total value of
£154 billion in 1998-99. It acts as an agent for
Royal Mail and Parcelforce Worldwide,
government departments, local authorities and
Alliance & Leicester Giro banking services.
There are about 19,000 post offices in the UK,
of which around 600 are operated directly by
the Post Office. The remainder are franchise
offices or are operated on an agency basis by
sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a variety of specialist
services. Parcelforce Worldwide provides a
door-to-door overnight delivery service
throughout the UK and an international
service to over 240 countries and territories. It
handles 138 million items a year. ‘Datapost
Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery within or
between major UK cities. The Philatelic
Bureau in Edinburgh is an important outlet
for the Post Office’s philatelic (postage stamp)
business, including sales to overseas collectors
or dealers.
Private Courier and Express Services
Private sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive door-to-
door deliveries, subject to a minimum fee,
currently of £1. The courier/express service
industry has grown rapidly and the annual
revenue earned by the carriage of these items
is estimated at about £2 billion. The UK is a
major provider of monitored express deliveries
in Europe, with London one of the main
centres for air courier/express traffic.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
23 The Economy
Structure and Performance 382 Industrial and Commercial Policy 389
Economic Strategy 388 Corporate Affairs
The UK economy has been affected by the downturn in the global economy,
with a slowing in the rate of economic growth. However, employment has been
rising and inflation is running at a historically low level. Interest rates are lower
than in 1998, and there are indications of a revival of confidence among
business and consumers.
The Government’s economic policies are directed towards the achievement
of high and stable levels of growth and employment, with the aim of enabling
everyone to share in higher living standards and greater job opportunities. It is
working to increase UK competitiveness through promoting enterprise and
innovation, creating strong and competitive markets, and developing an
effective legal and regulatory framework for business.
STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE
The value of all goods and services produced
for final consumption in the economy is
measured by gross domestic product. In 1998
GDP at current market prices totalled £843.7
billion. Between 1995 and 1998 GDP at
constant prices increased by 8.5% (see Table
23.1). Values for two of the main economic
indicators are shown in the charts on p. 383.
Output
Long-term economic growth in the UK has
averaged around 2.25% a year. The recession
of the early 1990s was followed by a recovery
in output. GDP grew by 3.5% in 1997, but by
2.2% in 1998, reflecting a slower rise in
domestic demand—under the influence of
tighter monetary and fiscal policy—and a
negative contribution to overall growth from
net trade as a result of the strengthening in
sterling and the slowdown in the global
economy. Slower growth is expected in 1999,
mainly as a result of weaker growth in UK
export markets, and GDP is forecast by HM
Treasury (in the 1999 Budget forecast) to rise
by 1% to 172%. However, growth is expected
to be stronger in 2000.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector (see
chapter 30), and this pattern has continued
during the 1990s. In 1998 service industries’
output increased by 3.7%, with particularly
strong growth in transport, storage and
communications (6.5%) and business services
and finance (5.3%). Manufacturing (see
chapter 28) now contributes less than a
quarter of GDP, compared with over a third
in 1950. Manufacturing growth has been well
below that of services, and in 1998 as a whole
manufacturing output rose by 0.4%, with

Over the past 25 years the UK has
experienced lower economic growth than its
major competitors. In terms of purchasing
power, income per head in 1998 was below that
of the other G7 countries. Productivity is also
lower than in many other industrialised
countries, partly reflecting earlier low levels of
investment (see below). Data from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) shows the UK’s
productivity gap with the United States, France
and Germany is substantial—up to a third.
Investment
In recent decades the UK’s capital investment
has accounted for a smaller share of GDP than
other industrialised countries—around 17%
of GDP, compared with the OECD average of
21%. This has left a legacy of low capital stock
per worker. In November 1998 a survey for

though—notably oil, pharmaceuticals, water

largest UK investors were Shell, BT, BP,
Cable & Wireless, and British Airways.

at constant 1995 prices increased by 9.9% to
£144 billion (see Table 23.3), representing £148
billion at current prices.
Business investment has been rising strongly
since 1995, and in 1998 was up by 12.5% at
constant prices, the highest rate of growth since
1988. The rise was heavily concentrated in
private sector services, where investment rose
by 18.8%, while manufacturing investment
increased by only 3.8%.
General government investment has declined
in recent years. However, it rose by 8.2% in
1998 and is forecast to rise substantially over the
next three years (see p. 402).
Business Structure
The UK has around 3.7 million businesses.
They include many big companies—of the top
500 European companies recorded by the
Financial Times in 1998, around 150 were UK-
based. About 3,000 UK businesses employ
over 500 people and account for 38% of total
employment by UK businesses and a similar
proportion of turnover. In some sectors a
small number of large companies and their
subsidiaries are responsible for a substantial
Expenditure on acquisitions overseas by
UK companies reached a record £54
billion in 1998, when the UK overtook the
United States to become the largest buyer
of overseas firms in that year. This
primarily reflected the merger between
British Petroleum (BP) and Amoco of the
US to form BP Amoco. Other recent
large-scale cross-border mergers and
acquisitions involving UK companies
include the merger between Zeneca and
Astra of Sweden in April 1999 to form
AstraZeneca (one of the world’s largest
pharmaceuticals companies) and the
takeover by Vodafone of AirTouch of the
US to form Vodafone AirTouch. The UK
has also attracted large-scale inward
investment, including acquisitions by
overseas companies. The cumulative value
of inward investment in the UK is now
almost £200 billion, while inward direct
investment totalled £38 billion in 1998.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Small firms play an important part in the UK
economy, around 45% of the workforce work for
companies employing fewer than 50 people.
Around 2.3 million businesses are sole traders or
partners without employees, while a further
900,000 businesses employ one to four people.
Together these 3.2 million enterprises account
for 89% of the number of businesses, 24% of
business employment and 16% of turnover.
Private sector firms predominate in the
economy. The public sector has become much
less significant following the privatisation since
1979 of some 100 public sector businesses,
including gas, electricity supply, coal and
telecommunications. The remaining major
nationalised industries are the Post Office,
London Transport, BNFL (British Nuclear _
Fuels) and the Civil Aviation Authority.
Household Income and Expenditure
Total resources of the household sector
(including non-profit institutions serving
households) rose by 4.5% in 1998 to nearly
£825 billion. Gross disposable income—after
deductions, including taxes and social
contributions—totalled £566 billion. In real
terms, households’ disposable income in 1998
was similar to that in 1997. Household net
financial wealth continues to grow strongly,
and in 1998 amounted to £2,072 billion.
Wages and salaries accounted for nearly 60%
of household primary income in 1998 and rose
by almost 7% during the year.
In 1998, 94% of after-tax household
income was spent and 6% saved. The
household saving ratio fell from 9.3% in 1997
to 6.4% in 1998. This fall, to what is a more
normal level, reflected households using
savings to support their spending during a
period of temporarily slower income growth.
Households’ final consumption
expenditure accounted for 75% of total final
consumption expenditure in 1998, and
amounted to £525 billion at current market
prices. In terms of constant prices, it grew by
3.3% in 1998, although there was an
underlying slowing in consumer demand
through the year. Expenditure on services,
however, remained relatively strong, rising by
4.4% in real terms in 1998. Expenditure on
durable goods was 6.5% higher than in 1997.
Table 23.5 shows the changing pattern of
households’ final consumption expenditure.
Over the longer term, as incomes rise, people
tend to spend increasing proportions of their
disposable income on durable goods and
certain services. Spending on leisure pursuits
and tourism, communications, health and
financial services have all shown significant
growth in recent years. Declining proportions
are being spent on food and alcoholic drink,
tobacco, and fuel and power.
Inflation
The two main measures of retail price
inflation used in the UK are:
• the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which
records the price of goods and services
purchased by households in the UK and
is used to calculate what is often referred
to as ‘headline’ inflation; and
• the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX), which is used to
calculate ‘underlying’ inflation and is the
target measure used by the Government
(see p. 388).
The Office for National Statistics is engaged
in a three-year programme to examine the RPI
series and potential ways of improving its
relevance to the UK economy.
Underlying annual inflation in the last 20
years has fluctuated considerably, with a peak
of 20.8% in the year to May 1980. However, it
has been much lower in the 1990s, and since
1993 it has been in a relatively narrow range,
from 2%-3.5%. In 1998 it averaged 2.6%—the
RPI was 3.4%—and it has been close to the
government target in recent months. Sharp falls
in import prices—reflecting the appreciation in
sterling since summer 1996 and relatively low
world commodity prices—have contributed to
the low level of inflation. The impact of these
factors is also evident in the data on producer
prices. Input prices for materials and fuel
purchased by manufacturing industry fell by
17.3% in the two years to December 1998. The
index has fluctuated since then, but remains
below the levels recorded as far back as 1992.
Output price inflation has also remained low,
with prices of manufactured products in the UK
rising by just 1.3% in the year to August 1999.

W ithin the RPI, the price of tobacco has
recently been rising at well above the average
rate, reflecting both higher levels of duty and
increases in manufactures’ prices. However, in
August 1999 a number of items—including
mortgage interest payments, leisure goods,
consumer durables, clothing and footwear,
telephone services, and gas and electricity—
were cheaper than a year earlier.
Another measure of inflation is the
harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP),
which is calculated in each EU member state
for the purposes of international comparison.
In 1998 the HICP for the UK was 1.5%.
During most of 1998 and 1999 the UK’s
HICP has been slightly above the EU average.
Labour Market
In spite of the slowdown in economic growth,
employment in the UK in early 1999 was
rising faster than a year previously, and
economic inactivity was falling as more people
found jobs or sought work. Employment in
the three months to June 1999 was 27.4
million, 347,000 higher than a year earlier (see
chapter 11). Unemployment has fallen in
recent years and is below that in many other
European countries, while long-term and
youth unemployment have both declined
substantially. In the three months to June
1999, according to the International Labour
Organisation measure, unemployment was 1.8
million, 6.0% of the workforce.
Overseas Trade
International trade plays a key role in the UK
economy (see chapter 25). The UK is the fifth
largest exporter of goods and services, and
exports accounted for 27% of GDP in 1998.
Other EU countries took 58% of UK exports
387
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
of goods in 1998 and supplied 55% of
imported goods.
Although the UK’s surplus on the current
account (see p. 415) fell from £6.3 billion in
1997 to £0A billion in 1998, this was the first
time since 1984 and 1985 that two consecutive
annual surpluses had been recorded. The
deficit on trade in goods rose to £20.8 billion,
with global developments—notably the
financial crisis in Asia—adversely affecting
UK exports. However, this deficit was more
than offset by the combined effects of record
surpluses on both trade in services (£12.3
billion) and on investment income (£15.1
billion).
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The main elements of the Government’s
economic strategy, which is designed to
improve the underlying rate of growth and
employment, are:
• ensuring economic stability, as a platform
for long-term sustainable growth;
• raising productivity through promoting
enterprise and investment;
• increasing employment opportunity (see
chapter 11); and
• creating a fairer society.
HM Treasury is the department with prime
responsibility for the Government’s monetary
and fiscal frameworks. It is also responsible for
economic policy, which it carries out in
conjunction with other government
departments, such as Trade and Industry;
Education and Employment; and the
Environment, Transport and the Regions.
Economic Stability
The Government considers that economic
stability is vital for the achievement of its
central economic objective of high and stable
levels of growth and employment. It has
introduced new7 frameworks for both monetary
and fiscal policies to ensure low inflation and
sound public finances.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC, see p. 510) is responsible
for setting interest rates to meet the
Government policy on membership of the
European single currency (see p. 80) was
set out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
in October 1997. The determining factor
underpinning any government decision on
membership of the single currency is
whether the economic case for the UK
joining is clear and unambiguous.
To make that assessment of the national
economic interest, the Government has set
out five economic tests which will have to
be met before any decision to join can be
taken. These are:
• whether the UK economy has
achieved sustainable convergence with
the economies of the single currency;
• whether there is sufficient flexibility
in the UK economy to adapt to
economic change;
• the effect membership would have on
investment in the UK;
• the impact membership would have on
the UK financial services industry; and
• whether joining the single currency
would be good for employment.
The Government has said that, barring
some fundamental and unforeseen change
in economic circumstances, making a
decision during this Parliament to join is
not realistic. However, preparations should
be made in this Parliament so that, should
the economic tests be met, a decision to
join a successful single currency can be
made early in the next Parliament. In
February 1999 HM Treasury issued a
National Outline Changeover Plan for the
UK, a consultative document setting out
the practical steps that would need to be
taken by business and the public sector if
the UK were to join the single currency.
Government’s inflation target of 2.5%, as
defined by the 12-month increase in RPIX.
This new framework has put monetary policy
on a long-term footing, and is one of the most
transparent and accountable in the world.
Between October 1998 and June 1999 the
MPC cut short-term interest rates from 7.5%
to 5%, although it raised the rate to 5.25% in
388
THE ECONOMY
September 1999. However, interest rates
remain at historically very low levels.
International Stability
The UK Government is playing a major part
in promoting economic stability around the
world. The aim is to reduce the likelihood of
future global uncertainties, such as those
which occurred in 1998 when the world
economy was affected by exceptional
movements in financial markets, initiallv in
parts of Asia but spreading to other areas, such
as Russia and Latin America. A series of
reforms being adopted by G7 countries,
including the establishment of a Financial
Stability Forum and the implementation of
codes of good practice on fiscal policy,
monetary and financial policy, corporate
governance, and accounting, are expected to
help reduce the volatility of financial markets
and increase the prospects for international
economic stability and prosperity.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is guided by two strict rules
designed to deliver sound public finances:
• the golden rule—over the economic cycle
the Government will borrow only to
invest and not to fund current spending;
and
• the sustainable investment rule—public
sector net debt as a proportion of GDP
will be held at a stable and prudent level
over the economic cycle.
These rules mean that current taxpayers pay
for current spending, and they require public
borrowing to be kept under firm control.
The Code for Fiscal Stability, set up under
the Finance Act 1998, requires fiscal and debt
management policy to be carried out in
accordance with five key principles:
• transparency in setting fiscal policy
objectives, the implementation of fiscal
policy and the presentation of the public
accounts;
• stability in the fiscal policy-making
process and in the way that fiscal policy
affects the economy;
• responsibility in the management of the
public finances;
• fairness, including between present and
future generations; and
• efficiency in the design and implementation
of fiscal policy, and in managing both sides
of the public sector balance sheet.
The fiscal policy framework is being
strengthened by a new way of planning and
controlling public expenditure (see p. 402).
The Budget
The Budget is the Government’s main
economic statement of the year and is usually
issued in March. In a major speech to
Parliament, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
reviews the nation’s economic performance and
describes the Government’s economic
objectives and the tax and spending policies it
intends to follow in order to achieve them. The
1999 Budget report comprised two documents:
• the Economic and Fiscal Strategy
Report, setting out the Government’s
long-term strategy and objectives; and
• the Financial Statement and Budget
Report, providing a summary of each
Budget measure and an analysis of the
economic and public finance forecasts.
In advance of the spring Budget, the
Government now publishes a Pre-Budget
Report. As well as setting out economic and
fiscal developments and prospects, it describes
the direction of government policy and sets
out for consultation measures that are under
consideration for the forthcoming Budget.
INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL
POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) aims to increase UK competitiveness
and scientific excellence in order to generate
higher levels of sustainable growth and
productivity. It has four specific objectives:
• to promote enterprise, innovation and
higher productivity;
• to make the most of the UK’s scientific,
engineering and technological capabilities;
389
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• to create strong and competitive markets;
and
• to develop a fair and effective legal and
regulatory framework.
Measures to help achieve these objectives are
described below. DTI responsibilities on
export promotion are covered in chapter 25,
technology and innovation in chapter 26, and
consumer protection and the regulation of
financial services in chapter 30, while those
on industrial relations are described in
chapter 11.
Competitiveness
The Government set out its new industrial
policy in the White Paper on competitiveness,
Our Competitive Future: Building the
Knowledge Driven Economy, published in
December 1998. Its aim is for UK business to
close the performance gap with its
competitors, in terms of productivity and of
the ability to produce innovative new products
and create higher-value services. It envisages
harnessing the UK’s distinctive capabilities of
knowledge, skills and creativity to achieve this
objective. Among the government measures to
implement this policy are:
• measures to strengthen the UK's
capabilities, including an additional £1.4
billion to modernise the science and
engineering base, promotion of the
commercialisation of university research,
a proposed tax credit for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on
research and development (R&D), a new
Enterprise Fund to support the financing
of small businesses with growth potential,
including a new Venture Capital
Challenge for investment for early-stage
high-technology businesses;
• the promotion of collaboration, between
businesses and within regions, for
example, encouraging the adoption of
business ‘clusters’; and
• measures to make markets more competitive,
including implementing the Competition
Act 1998, and introducing an Electronic
Communications Bill and other measures
to liberalise communications markets.
To measure the UK’s progress in
improving competitiveness, a Competitiveness
Index containing a series of indicators will be
published in autumn 1999. A Competitiveness
Council of business people is advising on the
Index and related issues.
Business Support Services
The DTI promotes enterprise and innovation
through encouraging successful business
start-ups and offering businesses a number of
support services. Most support is designed to
assist business, especially SMEs, to expand
and invest, and to adopt best practice.
The main mechanism for delivering
business information, advice and support in
England is ‘Business Link’, a national
network of 81 local partnerships. These
provide a single local point of access for
integrated information and advisory services
tailored to the needs of businesses, and
deploy some 650 personal business advisers
and 290 specialist counsellors for export
development, design, and innovation and
technology. Business Link partners include
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs—
see p. 152), chambers of commerce,
enterprise agencies, local authorities and
other providers of business support. Business
Links are also developing partnerships with
In March 1999, as part of the Budget
statement, the Government announced its
intention to create the Small Business
Service (SBS) which will act as a strong
voice for small businesses within
government and will ensure the provision
of support programmes to suit their needs.
The specific roles have not yet been
finalised, but one function will be to
reduce the burden of regulation on small
firms and provide assistance to SMEs in
complying with regulations. Its
responsibilities will include the new
Enterprise Fund and establishing a payroll
service for new employers in order to
reduce the burden of complying with the
tax system. The SBS is expected to be
operational by April 2000.

THE ECONOMY
the new Regional Development Agencies (see
p. 11).
Elsewhere in the UK similar business
support arrangements apply:
• in Scotland, the Business Shops Network
brings together business development
organisations, local authorities and
chambers of commerce to support new
and growing businesses;
• in Wales, Business Connect covers all the
main business support agencies and has a
network of business support and front¬
line advice centres; and
• in Northern Ireland small firms are
helped by the Local Enterprise
Development Unit’s network of regional
offices.
Business Finance
In 1998 the DTI reviewed the methods of
finance available for SMEs, such as venture
capital (see p. 515). It found that there was a
tendency for firms to rely on debt finance
(such as bank loans) when equity finance
might be more appropriate, but sometimes
equity finance was difficult to obtain. It
therefore plans to set up by the end of 1999 a
new Enterprise Fund to provide financial
support for SMEs with growth potential.
Funding of £180 million will be available
between 1999 and 2002 with the aim of
stimulating a contribution of £500 million
from the private sector for these firms.
The Fund will become responsible for the
Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme,
currently the DTPs main instrument for
supporting business finance. The scheme
provides a guarantee enabling authorised
lenders to loan money to SMEs lacking the
security to receive conventional finance (4,482
loans valued at £189 million were guaranteed
in 1998-99).
Among other measures designed to
encourage investment are the Enterprise
Investment Scheme (EIS) and Venture
Capital Trusts (VCTs). These schemes seek to
encourage individuals to invest in smaller
unlisted trading companies in return for
various tax reliefs and are designed to help
smaller UK early-stage and expanding firms.
The EIS allows ‘business angels’1 to take a
position on the board of the investee company.
VCTs are similar to an investment trust (see
p. 517) and are quoted on the London Stock
Exchange. Under a new Venture Capital
Challenge scheme (part of the Enterprise
Fund), funding of £20 million will be
available from the Capital Modernisation
Fund (see p. 402) for investment in new funds
for early-stage high-technology businesses in
partnership with project investors. Other
measures, which will apply from 2000 and are
designed to provide incentives for investors
and entrepreneurs to encourage investment,
include:
• an Enterprise Management Incentives
scheme, which will provide tax relief for
certain forms of equity-based
remuneration in small higher-risk trading
companies;
• a new tax incentive to promote corporate
venturing through promoting inter-firm
collaboration and improving the flow of
investment to early-stage companies from
larger firms; and
• a tax credit for spending by SMEs on
R&D.
Design, Quality and Standards
Through the independent Design Council, the
DTI supports the effective use of design and
design management techniques, which can
make a significant contribution to the creation
of successful products, processes and services,
and to improving competitiveness. As
advocate for design at the national level, the
Design Council undertakes research into
design issues, and develops design tools for
use by industry, business, education and
government, and publicises the results. It
liaises with Scottish Design, the Welsh Design
Advisory Service and the Northern Ireland
Design Directorate on national initiatives. A
separate design service offers support for

Millennium Products
‘Millennium Products’ is a Design Council
initiative which aims to identify, encourage
and promote innovative British products
looking forward to the new millennium.
Hundreds of products have been selected,
including a new evacuation system for
ships, a gas-powered lorry, a prosthetic

industry through Business Links in England,
with financial support from the DTI.
Quality is important throughout the business
cycle—design, production, marketing and
delivery to customers. Conformity assessment,
such as certification to the international
standard for quality management—BS EN ISO
9000 (which includes ISO 9001, the standard
embracing design development)—is a key
method of improving quality and
competitiveness. In order to increase customer
confidence, many suppliers rely on independent
conformity assessment of their management
systems or products and services. The
competence and performance of organisations
undertaking such certification are officially
accredited by the DTI-sponsored United
Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).
Companies certified by UKAS-accredited
bodies are permitted to use the national
accreditation marks, including the ‘tick and
crown’ for BS EN ISO 9000 certification.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System. This
provides, through several DTI-funded
standards, laboratories and other contractors,
many of the physical measurement standards
and associated calibration facilities necessary
to ensure that measurements in the UK are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy (see p. 432).
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the
national standards body and is the British
member of the European and international
standards organisations. It works with
industry, consumers and government to
produce standards relevant to the needs of the
market and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. The Kitemark is BSI’s
registered product certification trade mark.
Government support for BSI is directed
particularly towards European and
international standards, which account for
over 90% of its work. The Government is
reviewing with BSI the action that might be
taken to speed up the process of setting
standards, both within the UK and
internationally.
Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export,
Technological and Environmental
Achievement recognise outstanding
performance in their respective fields. In 1999,
82 Awards were made for Export
Achievement, 14 for Technological
Achievement and five for Environmental
Achievement. Awarded annually, they are
valid for five years and are granted by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister,
who is assisted by an advisory committee
consisting of senior representatives from
business, trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in the UK with at least two full-time
employees is eligible to apply so long as it
meets the scheme’s criteria. Following a
review, from 2000 the Awards will be renamed
The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise, with
three categories: international trade,
innovation and environmental achievement.
Other awards include the Export Award for
Smaller Businesses (for firms employing fewer
than 200 people) and the MacRobert Award
for engineering made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological
innovation.
The Millennium Bug
The Government is working to ensure that
both the private sector and the public sector
are fully aware of the ‘Millennium Bug’, the
century date change problem which arises in
392
THE ECONOMY
information technology (IT) systems and
electronic equipment where the year is
represented by two digits rather than four (e.g.,
‘99’ instead of 1999). As the year changes from
1999 to 2000, there is the possibility that two-
digit systems might malfunction, for example,
by reverting to the year 1900, or cease to
operate. Costs involved in overcoming the
Millennium Bug can be substantial. The UK
Government has estimated that expenditure of
£430 million will be needed to fix IT systems in
central government departments and agencies.
The Government has set up ‘Action 2000’, a
company which is charged with raising
awareness of the problem, providing practical
advice to businesses and encouraging them to
tackle the problem. Action 2000 has set up a
National Infrastructure Forum bringing
together the major providers of essential
services to share best practice. According to
Action 2000’s latest assessment in July 1999,
the providers of the main UK utilities
(including gas, electricity and water supply),
telecommunications and financial services have
made significant progress to ensure that there
will be no material disruption to these essential
services. Other key sectors, such as food
supply, health and transport, are also taking
appropriate measures to ensure that services are
not disrupted. However, research by Action
2000 has found that some businesses—
especially SMEs—need to take further action
to avoid possible disruption to their operations.
Education and Training
Education and training are central to ensuring
the UK’s competitiveness by creating and
maintaining a flexible, highly skilled and
highly qualified workforce. The Government
has announced a number of measures to
increase education and training opportunities
and to modernise skills (see chapters 10 and
11), including:
• the new University for Industry, to be
launched in 2000, which is expected to
play a key role in boosting
competitiveness by raising people’s skill
levels and employability by using modern
information and communications
technologies; and
• a new national information technology
strategy to encourage the wider use of
computers in business, education and the
community—a planned network of up to
1,000 IT learning centres will be targeted
at developing partnerships with business
to meet future skill needs.
A network of 78 business-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and
Wales and 22 local enterprise companies
(LECs) in Scotland, run by Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 394), provide training,
vocational education and enterprise
programmes on behalf of the Government and
offer advisory and training services to
businesses. TECs and LECs also have a role in
regeneration and economic development
activities locally (see chapter 21). In Northern
Ireland, training schemes are run by the
Training and Employment Agency (see p. 153).
Regional Development
Regional policy is designed to promote
economic growth and competitiveness in all
areas of the UK, working in partnership with
businesses, local authorities, voluntary groups
and others. Where additional help is needed, it
is focused on the Assisted Areas, which cover
around 34% of the UK’s working population.
The promotion of inward investment (see
p. 422) is a key element in the Government’s
regional policy.
The main instrument of government
support to industry in the Assisted Areas in
Great Britain is Regional Selective Assistance
(RSA), which is designed to help:
• create and safeguard jobs;
• attract international investment; and
• improve the competitiveness of
disadvantaged areas.
In 1998—99 the DTI spent an estimated £112
million on RSA grants in England, covering
around 870 projects with the expected creation
or safeguarding of around 28,000 jobs; total
investment in the projects is expected to be
some £1.5 billion. RSA is being changed to
focus support more on high-quality,
knowledge-driven projects providing skilled

One important role of the new RDAs is
facilitating the development of business
‘clusters’. These already exist in many
industries, for example, the traditional
concentrations of the steel industry around
Sheffield and the chemicals industry on
Teesside. Businesses can benefit from
shared infrastructure and close links to
training and research institutions, and
clusters tend to be conducive to the
creation and development of small start-up
firms. One example of a modern industry
growing up around a series of clusters is
the biotechnology industry, developing
around centres of research excellence,
including Oxford and Cambridge. The
DTI has established a team of experts to
examine the growth of biotechnology
clusters in the UK and how the UK can
maintain its competitive position in this
fast-growing sector (see p. 474).

Eight new Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) became fully operational in April
1999—a ninth, for London, will come into
operation in 2000 (see also chapter 2). They
are developing strategies to improve their
regions’ economic performance and enhance
competitiveness. The RDAs are working with
the Government Offices for the Regions,
chambers of commerce, TECs, Business Links
and other economic development bodies. The
activities of the RDAs include:
• encouraging innovation and the
exploitation of technology, including co¬
ordinating the development and
implementation of regional innovation and
technology action plans with local partners;
• reviewing business support in their areas;
• providing finance, including establishing
new regional venture capital funds to
provide equity finance to small
businesses with growth potential;
• promoting inward investment; and
• promoting a strategic use of EU
structural funds in their regions.
Scotland
In Scotland a range of schemes is operated by
the Scottish Executive Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Department, which has
overall responsibility for development of the
Scottish economy, and emphasis is given to
the links between education and enterprise.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise are the lead economic development
agencies in lowland and highland Scotland
respectively, operating mainly through the
network of LECs (see p. 152). Their duties
include:
• promoting industrial efficiency and
competitiveness;
• attracting inward investment and
encouraging exports;
• giving financial and management support
to new businesses and helping existing
ones to expand;
• improving the environment by
reclaiming derelict and contaminated
land; and
• increasing job opportunities and skills.
In early 1999 the Government announced
new economic strategies for both bodies, and
these will be used as a foundation for their
future operation by the Scottish Parliament.
The Scottish Enterprise Strategy emphasises
the importance of innovation and the value of
strong domestic enterprises, and will use a
cluster-based approach to help develop
industries which are likely to be particularly
successful. The Highlands and Islands
Enterprise Strategy aims to enable the people
of the Highlands and Islands to realise their
full potential by strengthening communities,
developing skills and stimulating businesses,
while encouraging more firms to compete on
an international basis. Both strategies intend
to safeguard environmental and social assets
and stress the importance of social inclusion.

THE ECONOMY
Wales
The purposes of the Welsh Development
Agency (WDA—see p. 31) are to further
economic and social development, promote
efficiency in business and international
competitiveness, and improve the
environment of Wales. It is focusing on
developing stronger regional clusters (such as
supply and services chains), increasing
standards and efficiency, and helping Welsh
companies to exploit new technology. The
WDA’s programmes are being developed in
line with Pathway to Prosperity: A New
Economic Agenda for Wales (see p. 31). It is co¬
ordinating an Entrepreneurship Action Plan,
with the aim of fostering a stronger enterprise
culture in Wales. Support for enterprise
programmes has been raised, with a target of
creating at least 1,000 new entrepreneurs in
1999—2000 by helping them to set up high-
quality ventures. Three new investment
schemes were announced in March 1999 to
provide venture capital for SMEs, including a
£6 million venture capital fund, run jointly by
the WDA and National Westminster Bank, to
provide support for innovative developments
focusing on new technology, and a fl million
WDA small loans fund.
Northern Ireland
A review of Northern Ireland’s economic
strategy, Strategy 2010 (see p. 20), has been
produced by a steering group for
consideration by the new Northern Ireland
Assembly. Support for industrial development
is currently implemented through:
• the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with overseas companies
considering Northern Ireland as an
investment location, as well as the
development of local companies with
more than 50 employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, which provides advice and
assistance on R&D, innovation and
technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training
and management development.
European Union Regional Funding
The EU seeks to promote economic and social
cohesion, reducing disparities between the
regions and countries of the Union. The
principal responsibility for helping poorer areas
remains with national authorities, but the EU
complements schemes by awarding grants and
loans from various sources, including the
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
EU Structural Funds, especially the ERDF,
play an important role in regional development,
and the UK received ff billion from the Funds
in 1994-99. The highest level of assistance is
available to areas with ‘Objective F status,
where GDP is less than 75% of the EU average.
Changes in the areas qualifying for help are due
to take effect for the period 2000 to 2006. In the
UK Merseyside has retained its Objective 1
status, while Cornwall, West Wales and the
Valleys, and South Yorkshire have qualified for
Objective 1 status for the first time, so that just
under 9% of the UK population is now in
Objective 1 areas. In recognition of the special
position of Northern Ireland and the structural
problems faced by the Highlands and Islands,
both areas will receive special enhanced
transition packages after 1999, with funding
levels broadly equivalent to Objective 1 status.
The funding amounts to around £900 million
for Northern Ireland and £200 million for the
Highlands and Islands. Substantial aid is also
available to areas qualifying for ‘Objective 2’
status; this Objective supports the economic and
social conversion of areas facing structural
difficulties, in particular, areas undergoing
change in the industrial or service sectors,
declining rural areas, urban areas in difficulty
and depressed areas dependent on fisheries.
About 13.7 million people in the UK will be
covered by Objective 2 funding and the
Government is consulting on the areas which
will qualify for Objective 2 status.
Competitive Markets
The Government seeks to improve the
openness and effectiveness of markets, both
395
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
within the UK and internationally, and
believes that effective competition is the best
stimulus to innovation and efficiency. A new
competition regime is being introduced in the
UK under the Competition Act 1998, which
will come fully into effect on 1 March 2000,
with the aim of providing better protection,
both to consumers and to businesses.
Competition Act 1998
The Competition Act 1998 strengthens
competition law so that it is more effective in
dealing with anti-competitive practices. It is
modelled on EC competition law and provides
a strong deterrent against anti-competitive
practices and agreements such as cartels, and
against abuse of a dominant market position.
The Act prohibits agreements, practices and
conduct which have a damaging effect on
competition. The main enforcement authority
will be the Director General of Fair Trading
(head of the Office of Fair Trading—OFT),
who will have strong powers of investigation.
The Act will also be enforced by the utility
regulators in their sectors (see p. 398).
Financial penalties of up to 10% of a firm’s
UK turnover may be imposed, and those
affected by anti-competitive behaviour in
breach of the law may be able to claim for
damages in the courts.
Agreements will not fall within the scope of
the Act unless they have an appreciable effect
on competition. This, coupled with the
absence of any notification requirement, will
mean that the vast majority of firms will be
freed from the burden of notifying to the OFT
harmless, insignificant agreements, which is a
feature of the existing regime. In general, an
agreement is unlikely to be considered as
having an appreciable effect if the combined
market share of the parties to the agreement is
less than 25%. Nevertheless, agreements to fix
prices, to impose minimum resale prices or to
share markets will generally be seen as capable
of having an appreciable effect even where the
combined market share is below 25%. In
determining whether or not an undertaking is
in a dominant market position, the OFT, as a
general rule, is unlikely to consider an
undertaking as dominant if its market share is
under 40%.
A new body, the Competition Commission,
replaced the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) in April 1999. It has two
main arms:
• a reporting arm, which will take over the
MMC’s monopolies and mergers
functions under the Fair Trading Act
1973; and
• an Appeal Tribunals arm, which will hear
appeals against decisions of the Director
General of Fair Trading and the
regulators on the prohibitions of anti¬
competitive agreements and abuse of a
dominant position.
Monopolies and Mergers
The framework under the Fair Trading Act
1973 for dealing with scale and complex
monopolies2 is being retained alongside the
Competition Act. The Director General of Fair
Trading and those utility regulators which have
parallel powers to apply the monopoly
provisions of the 1973 Act may examine such
monopolies and make a reference to the
Competition Commission to establish whether
a monopoly operates, or may be expected to
operate, against the public interest.
Under the current framework, a merger
generally qualifies for investigation if it
involves the acquisition of assets of more than
£70 million or the creation or enhancement of
a 25% share of the supply of a particular good
or service in the UK or a substantial part of it.
Qualifying mergers are considered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, who then
advises the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry. There is a voluntary procedure for
pre-notification of proposed mergers. If there
are reasonable grounds for believing that a
merger could have a detrimental effect on
competition, the Director General can advise
the Secretary of State to refer it to the
Competition Commission. Alternatively, the
2 A complex monopoly is defined as a situation in which at
least two firms together supply 25% or more of a particular
good or service in the UK in a way that may distort
competition. A scale monopoly is defined as a situation in
which the action of a single firm supplying at least 25% of a
particular good or service may distort competition.
396
THE ECONOMY
A recent example of a merger that was not
allowed to proceed was the proposed
acquisition of Manchester United Football
Club by the media group BSkyB. In x^pril
1999 the Secretary of State accepted the
findings and recommendations of the
MMC and the Director General of Fair
Trading that the merger might be expected
to operate against the public interest (as it
would affect competition and innovation
between broadcasters and would damage
the long-term interests of British football)
and that it should be prohibited.
Director General may be asked to obtain
suitable undertakings from the companies
involved to remedy the adverse effects
identified. Most mergers are cleared without
being referred to the Competition Commission.
If the Competition Commission finds that a
merger could be expected to operate against
the public interest, the Secretary of State can
prohibit it or allow it subject to certain
conditions being met. Where the merger has
already taken place, action can be taken to
reverse it. There are special provisions for
newspaper and water company mergers.
The DTI issued a consultative document in
August 1999 on reforming the regulation of
mergers, so that decisions w ould normally be
taken by the competition authorities against a
competition-based test. Ministers would only
be involved in making decisions in a small
minority of cases w here specified public
interests, such as defence and national
security, are at issue.
Certain mergers with an EC dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they w ould create
or strengthen a dominant position which
would significantly impede effective
competition w ithin the EU or a substantial
part of it; alternatively, it may negotiate
undertakings to correct the adverse effect.
EU Single Market
The Government is w orking with the EU to
ensure effective competition in international
markets. Within the EU it is looking to
improve the operation of the single market
(see p. 419) and will support further measures
to strengthen competition. The Government
has set a target of implementing 98% of single
market measures by the end of 2000.
Information and Communications
Technology
The Government is keen to ensure that the
UK benefits fully from the rapid
developments in information and
communications technology, including the
growth of the Internet and of electronic
commerce (‘e-commerce’). Already, the UK
leads the world in some areas (such as digital
broadcasting) and in the delivery of certain
financial and business information on-line
services, while 52% of UK firms use e-mail.
The Government’s strategy is to ensure that
by 2002 the UK provides the best
environment in the world to do business
electronically, and it has appointed an ‘e-
envoy’ to take forward this strategy and
promote the UK overseas on e-commerce
issues. It is w orking to maintain the UK’s
communications infrastructure and to develop
a suitable regulatory framework.
xA.n Electronic Communications Bill is
planned, which w ill facilitate the development
of electronic trading and enhance public
confidence in the technologies concerned. It
will make it possible to remove the legal
barriers to using electronic means of
communicating, instead of pen and paper, and
w ill reduce uncertainty over the legal status of
electronic signatures and writing. A statutory
approvals system is to be established for
businesses providing electronic signature and
similar services, to ensure that suitable
standards of quality and service are maintained.
The DTI is working to ensure that all UK
businesses make the best use of information
and communications technologies to enhance
their competitiveness. Its Information Society
Initiative is providing businesses, especially
SMEs, with practical help and guidance to
enable them to exploit the opportunities for
doing business electronically. An extra £20
million is being invested over the next three
years with the aim of tripling, to 1 million, the
397
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
number of small businesses in the UK which
can trade electronically.
CORPORATE AFFAIRS
Corporate Structure
Nearly 1.4 million companies are registered
with the Registrar of Companies—all UK
companies must register, as must companies
incorporated overseas with a place of business
or branch in the UK. Most corporate
businesses are ‘limited liability’ companies,
where the liability of members is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee).
Companies may be either public or private;
around 13,500 are public limited companies
(pics), of which 2,450 have their shares listed
on the London Stock Exchange (see p. 518). A
company must satisfy certain conditions
before it can become a public limited company
(pic). It must be limited by shares or
guarantee, have a share capital and meet
specified minimum capital requirements. All
other UK companies are private companies
and are generally prohibited from offering
their shares to the public.
Company Law and Corporate
Governance
Laws relating to companies are designed to meet
the need for proper regulation of business, to
maintain open markets and to create safeguards
for those wishing to invest in companies or do
business with them. They take account of EC
directives on company law, and on company and
group accounts and their auditing.
During the 1990s three major committees—
the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel
committees—have reported on a range of
corporate governance issues, including best
practices and directors’ pay. As a result,
principles of good governance and a code of best
practice have been added to the London Stock
Exchange’s listing rules. Companies listed on
the Stock Exchange are required to state in their
annual report and accounts whether they are
complying with the code’s provisions, and give
reasons for areas of non-compliance.
The DTI has initiated a fundamental review
of company law, with the aim of producing a
modern framework which is clear and
accessible, and promotes competitiveness.
The review is being directed by a steering
group of independent experts, and its final
report is due in 2001. In February 1999 the
group issued a consultative document
explaining the strategy that it intended to
adopt in the review and outlining its
proposals for future work. Provisional
proposals contained in the consultation
document include:
• restructuring company law to make it
more accessible for those running
smaller firms;
• simplifying some technical areas of
company law, such as the rules on
company formation; and
• using modern methods of information
and communications technology to
improve communications between
companies and their shareholders.
Regulation of Business
In its Modernising Government White Paper,
issued in March 1999 (see p. 57), the
Government announced a new policy on
removing unnecessary regulation. The DTI
works to minimise regulatory burdens on
business, and considers the use of non-
regulatory solutions where these may be most
appropriate. An independent Better Regulation
Task Force advises the Government on action
to improve the effectiveness and quality of
existing regulations, while making sure that they
remain necessary, are fair—especially to small
businesses and the consumer—affordable, and
simple to understand and administer.
Utility Regulation
Special arrangements cover the privatised
utilities—including telecommunications,
electricity, gas, water, and railways—where
independent regulators have powers and
duties to promote competition and the
interests of consumers. One of the regulators’
duties is the setting of prices.
398
THE ECONOMY
Following a review of the regulation of gas,
electricity, telecommunications and water, the
Government is introducing a number of
changes to the regulatory framework, including:
• a new primary duty on the regulators to
protect and promote the interests of
consumers through competition
wherever possible and appropriate;
• new independent consumer councils for
the energy, telecommunications and
water sectors;
• measures to bring about a more
competitive market for gas and electricity,
including provision for separate licensing
of supply and distribution in electricity;
• a merger and alignment of gas and
electricity regulation, and the creation of
a single energy regulator; and
• measures to improve the transparency,
consistency and accountability of
regulation.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in the
UK, directly or indirectly representing around
250,000 companies and 180 employers’
organisations and trade associations. The CBI
aims to help create and sustain the conditions
in which business can compete. It campaigns
to lessen the administrative and regulatory
burdens on business, tackle handicaps on
competition and improve the performance of
companies. It offers members a range of advisory
services. It has 13 regional offices and an office
in Brussels. The CBI is the British member of
the Union of Industrial and Employers’
Confederations of Europe (UNICE).
Chambers of commerce represent business
views to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development, for example, through regeneration
projects, tourism, inward investment promotion
and business services, including overseas trade
missions, exhibitions and training conferences.
The British Chambers of Commerce represents
about 120,000 businesses, through 60 approved
chambers of commerce. It offers commercial and
export-related services to its members.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has
around 48,000 members in the UK. It
provides business advisory services on matters
affecting company directors, such as corporate
management, insolvency and career
counselling, and represents the interests of
members to authorities in the UK and EU.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the
largest pressure group promoting the interests
of the self-employed and small firms. The
Federation has 150,000 members, and
provides them with expert information and
guidance on subjects such as taxation,
employment, health and safety, and insurance.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members in dealings with
government departments

Taxes and social security contributions as a proportion of gross national
product (GNP) in the UK are now lower than in the mid-1980s, in contrast to
the position in many other advanced industrialised countries. Lower rates of
income tax and corporation tax have been introduced in the UK. Nearly three-
fifths of public expenditure is on social security, health and education. Public
expenditure has been thoroughly reviewed, with more spending planned in
priority areas, notably health and education. The largest single expenditure
programme is on social security.
Between 1986 and 1996 taxes and social
security contributions as a proportion of
GNP declined in the UK from 37.5% to
35.5%, while the European Union (EU)
average rose from 40.4% to 44.4%. The
UK’s share is also below the average for the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (see diagram). When
the comparison is restricted to taxes, the
share of GNP for the UK is 29.3%, slightly
above the OECD average and around the
average for the EU.
The Comprehensive Spending Review,
completed in July 1998, set out the
Government’s plans for current public
expenditure to grow by 21A% a year on
average in real terms over the next three years,
and for public sector net investment to rise
substantially over this period (see Table 24.1).
A new regime for planning and expenditure
has been adopted and supports the
Government’s fiscal policy framework (see
chapter 23). It involves firm three-year plans
to enable departments to plan ahead and
provide a more stable foundation for managing
public services, and a distinction between
current and capital spending, through separate
budgets.

In the first decade of the 20th century,
excise duties accounted for 45% of central
government tax revenue, property and
income tax 21% and death duties 12%. In
1998-99 the main categories of revenue
were income tax (net of tax credits),
estimated at £85.5 billion (26% of current
receipts), social security contributions
£54.9 billion (16%), value added tax
(VAT) £51.7 billion (15%), fuel, alcohol
and tobacco duties £35.7 billion (11%) and
corporation tax £29.8 billion (9%).
Defence accounted for over half of
public expenditure in the first decade of
the 20th century. For 1999-2000 its share
of public spending will be around 6%,
while other main components will be:
• social security—£102 billion (29%);
• health—£61 billion (17%);
• education—£41 billion (12%); and
• debt interest—£26 billion (7%).
MAIN PROGRAMMES AND
PRIORITIES
The government departments with the largest
spending programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (with
forecast expenditure of £99.1 billion on
benefits in 1999-2000);
• the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)—
£43.9 billion, of which £34.2 billion is on
local government (the largest part of
which is spent on education) and regional
policy;
• the Department of Health (£40.3 billion);
and
• the Ministry of Defence (£22.3 billion).
Local authorities are estimated to spend
about £82.4 billion in 1999—2000, around a
quarter of public expenditure. The main
categories of expenditure are education, law
and order, personal social services, housing
and other environmental services, and roads
and transport.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Following the Government’s
Comprehensive Spending Review, extra
resources have been allocated to two of the
Government’s main priorities: education and
health. Expenditure on education is planned
to rise by over 5% a year across the UK in real
terms, representing extra expenditure of £19
billion over the three years from 1999-2000.
This involves doubling the capital budget for
schools, expanding further education and
higher education, and expenditure on the new
University for Industry and the lifelong
learning initiative (see chapter 10). Around
£21 billion of additional resources are being
provided to modernise the National Health
Service (NHS), including a major hospital
building programme (see chapter 13). Other
areas receiving extra resources are:
• the regeneration of the UK’s cities and
housing resources, for which an extra
£4.4 billion is being allocated;
• public transport, with an extra £1.7
billion to modernise the road and rail
network over the next three years; and
• science, where £1.1 billion is being
invested to modernise the UK’s research
capabilities.
A new Investing in Britain Fund has been
set up to provide for the renewal and
modernisation of the UK’s public sector
capital stock. Net public investment is
planned to rise to £10 billion by 2001-02 (see
Table 24.1). Over £2.5 billion of the Fund
will be overseen by HM Treasury in a Capital
Modernisation Fund, which will be allocated
to departments on a competitive basis.
Control of Spending
A new regime for controlling public
expenditure has replaced the annual spending
round, under which government departments
used to submit their bids for expenditure for
the following year. Instead, departments have
firm plans for 1999—2000 and the following
two financial years. These plans will be rolled
forward in 2000 in the next spending review,
which is expected to be the first round of
budgeting conducted on the basis of resource
accounting information (see p. 403).
The March 1999 Budget contained a series
of measures involving planned investment
of £1.1 billion over the next three years,
which will be financed from the Capital
Modernisation Fund:
• up to £470 million to support the
Government’s national information
technology strategy (see p. 393),
including a challenge fund to create a
network of up to 1,000 IT-based
learning centres;
• £430 million to modernise accident
and emergency departments in NHS
hospitals and to improve patient care;
and
• £170 million to tackle crime and
make communities safer.
A new concept—Total Managed
Expenditure—covers all public sector spending
(see Table 24.2). Within this concept, current
and capital expenditure are planned and
managed separately. Around half of Total
Managed Expenditure is managed through
Departmental Expenditure Limits, involving a
tightly drawn control figure for each
department, which is set in cash terms. The
other half is Annually Managed Expenditure,
covering expenditure such as social security
benefit payments, which cannot reasonably be
subject to limits covering more than one year.
However, this is subject to rigorous scrutiny as
part of the Budget process.
Other reforms have been introduced to
improve the effectiveness of public spending.
Public service agreements are being adopted
across the Government covering departmental
objectives and measurable efficiency and
effectiveness targets. By mid-1999, over 30
agreements were in force. Departmental
performance against the targets is being
scrutinised by a Cabinet Committee, which is
chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and supported by a Public Services
Productivity Panel of experts from outside
government. Each department has produced
its own investment strategy, which will be
taken into account in the allocation of
resources from the Capital Modernisation
Fund.

A new Office of Government Commerce
will be set up as an office of HM Treasury in
April 2000 with the aim of maximising the
Government’s buying power; this is expected
to lead to substantial efficiency savings.
New Accounting and Budgeting
Procedures
Cash-based government accounts are being
replaced by more commercial ‘resource
accounting’ and budgeting methods. This is
designed to improve efficiency and focus more
on departmental objectives and outputs in
terms of resources used rather than the money
available for spending. The first full set of
published audited resource accounts for
government departments will be for 1999-
2000. The Government has announced its
intention to conduct the spending review in
2000 on a resource basis. Planning and
controlling public expenditure on a resource
accounting basis will be fully implemented for
2001-02, subject to parliamentary approval.
Examination of Public Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
question ministers and officials.
The Public Accounts Committee considers
the accounts of government departments,
executive agencies and other public sector
bodies, and reports by the Comptroller and
Auditor General on departments and their use
of resources. It submits reports to Parliament.
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO’s
responsibilities include certifying the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinising the
efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examining revenue accounts and
inventories; and reporting the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
Public-Private Partnerships
The Government sees Public-Private
Partnerships as a key factor in the delivery of
high-quality public services, by bringing in
private sector management, finance and
ownership to improve the value for money,
403
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
efficiency and quality of these services. An
important element is the Private Finance
Initiative (PFI), introduced in 1992, in which
the public sector specifies, in terms of the
outputs required, the service or information
technology (IT) needed, and private sector
companies compete to provide these
requirements. By May 1999 PFI projects with
a capital value of around £12 billion in total
had been signed, and £11 billion of private
sector investment in PFI schemes is expected
in the three years to March 2002. Many of
these schemes are in the transport sector (see
chapter 22), including the Channel Tunnel
Rail Link; a number of‘design, build, finance
and operate’ road projects; and the Croydon
Tramlink. Other significant projects include
22 new hospitals, six new prisons and an IT
partnership project for the Employment
Service.
The Government emphasises the
importance of good industrial relations, and
encourages consultation on projects with staff
and other interested parties. New guidance on
protecting the pension arrangements of staff
transferring to the private sector was
published in June 1999.
The Government is taking forward Public-
Private Partnerships for many of the
remaining commercial organisations in the
public sector, including London
Underground, National Air Traffic Services
and British Waterways (see chapter 22); the
Tote (see p. 299); and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (see p. 93).
A taskforce in HM Treasury acts as a focal
point for all PFI activities and as a provider of
advice and assistance to departments. From
April 2000 it will form part of the new Office
of Government Commerce (see p. 403). The
Government will also be creating in 2000 a
new body, Partnerships UK, to help increase
and improve investment from private sources
in the UK’s public services.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
The Government finances its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. Public sector finances have improved.
In 1998-99 there was a current budget surplus
(excluding windfall tax and associated
spending) of £7.3 billion, compared with a
deficit of £5.3 billion in 1997-98, and current
budget surpluses totalling £34 billion are
forecast over the next five years. Public sector
net debt fell from 44.1% of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1996-97 to 40.6% at the
end of 1998-99—amounting to some £349
billion. It is projected to fall below 40% of
GDP in 1999-2000 and to under 35% by
2003-04. Public sector net borrowing
(excluding the windfall tax and associated
spending) fell from £9.9 billion in 1997—98, so
that there was a net repayment of £2.5 billion
in 1998-99. General government gross debt
was about 47% of GDP in 1998—99. The
Government’s financing requirement for
1999-2000 is forecast to be about £21 billion,
to be met mostly from sales of gilt-edged stock
(‘gilts’).
The Government’s debt management
policy is to minimise the cost of meeting its
financing needs over the long term, taking risk
into account. Major changes in the
management of government debt are being
implemented, with the transfer of government
responsibility for debt and cash management
from the Bank of England to HM Treasury.
Responsibility for the sale of gilts and the
management of the gilts market now rests with
a Treasury agency, the United Kingdom Debt
Management Office (DMO), which is also due
to take over cash management operations in
1999-2000.
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument, government
bonds, is known as gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as
there is no risk of default. Gilts are widely
traded; holdings of marketable gilts total almost
£300 billion. Pension funds and life insurance
companies have the largest holdings. The
annual Debt Management Report sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming year.
Gilt issues are primarily by auction. This
used to be broadly monthly, but the frequency
has been reduced, reflecting lower
government borrowing. Gilts include
‘conventionals’, which generally pay fixed
rates of interest and redemption sums; and
index-linked stocks, on which principal and
interest are linked to movements in the Retail
404
PUBLIC FINANCE
Prices Index. The DMO is implementing a
series of reforms designed to improve the
efficiency of the gilts market. For example, the
first auction of index-linked gilts was held in
November 1998.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax;
• taxes on capital, which include
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, council
tax and non-domestic rates;
• taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT (value added tax) and customs and
excise duties; and
• National Insurance contributions (see
chapter 12), which give entitlement to a
range of benefits, including the
Retirement Pension and Jobseeker’s
Allowance.
Taxation Policy
The general principles underlying the
Government’s taxation policy are that the tax
system should:
• encourage employment opportunities and
work incentives for everyone;
• promote savings and long-term
investment; and
• be fair, and be seen to be fair.
Tax Measures in the 1999 Budget
Changes to taxation announced in the Budget
in March 1999 are intended to encourage
work, raise productivity, protect the
environment and provide help to those who
need it most (especially families and children).
Measures to Encourage Work and Support
Families
Reforms to the tax and benefits system are
designed to support families and ensure that
work and opportunity are encouraged and
rewarded rather than being discouraged, as
currently happens for some people who find
that their income from working is only slightly
higher than it would be if they were
unemployed. The main measures are:
• lower rates of income tax—a new starting
rate of 10% from April 1999 (the lowest
rate of income tax in the UK since 1962)
and a reduction in the basic rate from
23% to 22% from April 2000;
• a major reform to National Insurance
contributions (NICs), so that by April
2001 the threshold of earnings below
which people do not pay NICs will be the
same as that for the personal allowance
for income tax—this is expected to
eliminate NICs for about 900,000 people,
although benefit entitlement will be
protected;
• a new Children’s Tax Credit, from April
2001, which will succeed the married
couple’s and related allowances to be
abolished in April 2000; and
• a series of measures to help pensioners,
including higher personal tax allowances,
a rise in the winter fuel allowance from
£20 to £100 and an increase in the
minimum income guarantee for
pensioners.
Raising Productivity
The Budget contained a number of measures
designed to boost productivity through greater
investment, innovation and stronger
competition. A new 10% rate of corporation
tax for small businesses will apply from April
2000, and the 40% capital allowance for small
and medium-sized businesses has been
extended until July 2000. Previously
announced changes to corporation tax took
effect in April 1999, reducing the main rate to
30% (the lowest main corporate tax rate
among the major EU economies) and the small
companies’ rate to 20%. Other measures
announced include a research and
development tax credit for small and medium¬
sized firms and a new Employee Share
Ownership scheme, both of which will be
introduced in the 2000 Budget.
405
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Protecting the Environment
Budget measures to protect the environment
(see also p. 314) include:
• a new climate change levy from April
2001 to encourage energy efficiency in
business;
• a major reform in the taxation of
company cars from April 2002;
• a lower rate of vehicle excise duty (VED)
for cars with small engines (up to 1,100
cc), with VED for new cars from autumn
2000 being determined primarily by their
carbon dioxide emissions; and
• rises in the rate of landfill tax.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects
taxes on income, profits and capital, and
stamp duty. In April 1999 it also became
responsible for NICs when it merged with the
Contributions Agency, formerly an agency of
the Department of Social Security. HM
Customs and Excise collects the most
important taxes on expenditure (VAT and
most duties). The main local taxes—council
tax and non-domestic rates (see p. 410)—are
collected by local authorities.
Electronic transmission is already being
used to a limited extent in the collection of
taxes and duties; for example, some
accountants and other tax practitioners submit
clients’ returns electronically to the Inland
Revenue. The Finance Act 1999 will allow the
Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise
to develop new electronic services that can be
used instead of returns on paper, so that
businesses and individuals will be able to send
tax information to the collection authorities
via the Internet. By 2000—01 individual
taxpayers should be able to file their own tax
returns over the Internet.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Taxes on individual incomes are generally
progressive in that larger incomes are subject
to a greater amount of tax. Income tax is
imposed for the year of assessment beginning
on 6 April. The tax rates and bands for
1998-99 ancl 1999-2000 are shown in Table
24.3. A new 10% starting rate of income tax
took effect in April 1999, while the basic rate
is to be reduced to 22% from April 2000,
representing the lowest basic rate for nearly 70
years. The 10% starting rate applies to income
from work; the starting rate for income from
savings continues at 20%, except for
dividends (see Table 24.3). Of around 26
million income taxpayers, 1.8 million are
expected to pay tax only at the starting rate of
10% in 1999-2000, 1.2 million at 20%, 20.7
million at 23% and 2.3 million at 40%.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an
individual’s income tax liability, and the main
allowances are shown in Table 24.3. All
taxpayers are entitled to a personal allowance
against income from all sources, with a higher
allowance for the elderly. One of the most
significant reliefs covers employees’
contributions to their pension schemes, while
personal tax-free saving is encouraged through
the Individual Savings Account (ISA)
introduced in April 1999 (see p. 518).
In general, income tax is charged on all
income originating in the UK—although
some forms of income, such as child benefit,
are exempt—and on all income arising abroad
of people resident in the UK. Agreements
with over 100 countries provide relief from
double taxation, the largest network of tax
treaties in the world. UK residents working
abroad for the whole year may benefit from
100% tax relief.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted
for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay
the correct amount of tax during the year.
A self-assessment system for collecting
personal taxation has been introduced.
Around 9 million people—primarily higher-
rate taxpayers, the self-employed and those
receiving investment income (particularly
where this is paid without tax being
deducted)—are required to complete an
annual tax return for the Inland Revenue.
Taxpayers may calculate their own tax
liability, although they can choose to have the
406
PUBLIC FINANCE
In line with its policies of improving work
incentives, promoting a fair and efficient
tax system, and supporting families, the
Government has announced a number of
changes to the system of allowances. Two
of the main allowances are being
withdrawn:
• the married couple’s allowance
(MCA) and associated allowances
(including the additional personal
allowance) will be abolished from
April 2000—however, couples in
which at least one of the spouses is
aged 65 or over on 5 April 2000 w ill
be able to keep the MCA; and
• mortgage interest relief, which is
available at 10% on loans used for
house purchase up to a limit of
£30,000, will be withdrawn from
April 2000.1
A number of tax credits are being
introduced, including:
• the Working Families Tax Credit
(WFTC), which will replace Family
Credit in October 1999 (see chapter
12) and is designed to provide a
guaranteed minimum income for
working families;
• a new Children’s Tax Credit, which
w ill take effect from April 2001 and
provide an allowance worth up to
£416 a year to families with one or
more children under 16 living with
them—to target this on the most
needy families, the credit w ill
gradually be withdrawn where the
person claiming the credit is liable to
tax at the higher rate; and
• a new Employment Credit for those
aged over 50 who return to full-time
work after six months or more on
social security benefits.
1 Special provisions will be made to enable relief to
continue for elderly people who have taken out home
income plans. These plans usually involve a loan secured
on the home and enable the purchase of an annuity
providing income for the rest of a person’s life.
calculations done by the Inland Revenue if
they return the form by the end of September.
Corporation Tax
Companies pay corporation tax on their
income and capital gains after deduction of.
certain allowances and reliefs. The main rate
of corporation tax was cut to 30% in April
1999, w ith a reduced rate of 20% for small
companies (those with profits below’ £300,000
in a year). Relief is allow ed for companies w ith
profits betw een £300,000 and £1.5 million, so
that their overall rate is between the main rate
and the small companies’ rate. From April
2000 a new 10% rate of corporation tax w ill
apply to the smallest companies (those with
annual profits of up to £10,000). Some capital
expenditure—on machinery and plant,
industrial buildings, agricultural buildings and
scientific research, for example—may qualify
for relief in the form of capital allowances.
Expenditure on machinery or plant by small
or medium-sized businesses qualifies for a
first-vear allowance—40% for the year to July
2000.
A new’ system for corporation tax pavments
is being phased in over a four-year period
from April 1999, bringing the UK into line
with other major industrialised countries.
Around 20,000 large companies paying
corporation tax at the main rate now pay in
quarterly instalments, while advance
corporation tax (which had been payable by
companies distributing profits to their
shareholders) has been abolished.
Windfall Tax
The w indfall tax, a one-off tax on the excess
profits of the privatised utilities, was payable
in two instalments, in 1997 and 1998. Its
estimated yield of £5.2 billion is financing the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work programme
(see p. 154).
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production—as

aTax relief for these allowances is restricted to 15% of the allowance for 1998-99 and 10% for 1999-2000. The
additional personal allowance may be claimed by a taxpayer who is single, separated, divorced or widowed and
who has a child at home, and by a taxpayer (with a dependent child) who has an incapacitated wife or husband
living with him or her. The amounts for age-related MCAs in 1999-2000 were increased so that the value of this
allowance for people aged 65 and over would be protected. For consistency, the figures shown in 1998-99 for
these allowances reflect these increases. Only the further increase—in line with indexation—is shown in the Table.
bThe rates of tax applicable to savings income are 20% for income below the basic rate upper limit and 40,4 above
that. For 1999-2000 the rates applicable to dividends are 10% for income below the basic rate upper limit and
32.5% above that.

and gas in the UK and on its Continental
Shelf under licence from the Department of
Trade and Industry. Each licensee of an
oilfield or gasfield is charged at a rate of 50%
on the profits from that field after deduction
of certain allowances and reliefs. New fields
given consent for development on or after 16
March 1993 are not liable to PRT.
Taxes on Capital
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by
individuals and trusts on gains realised from
the disposal of assets. It is payable on the
amount by which total chargeable gains for a
year exceed the exempt amount (£7,100 f°r
individuals and £3,550 for most trusts in
1999-2000). Gains on some types of asset are
exempt from CGT. These include the
principal private residence, government
securities, certain corporate bonds, and gains
on holdings of Personal Equity Plans and
IS As. For individuals, CGT is payable at 20%
where the gains when added to an individual’s
annual income are below the basic income tax
rate upper limit, and at 40% where the total
amount exceeds this limit.
CGT was substantially changed in the 1998
Budget, to encourage longer-term holding of
assets: long-term gains are now taxed less
heavily than short-term gains. Indexation
relief to take account of the effects of inflation
no longer applies after April 1998. Instead, a
‘taper’ reduces the amount of the chargeable
gain depending on how long an asset has been
408
PUBLIC FINANCE
held. For a business asset the percentage of
the gain that is chargeable is reduced from
100% for assets held for less than one year to
25% for assets held for ten years or more. For
non-business assets the chargeable gain falls
from 100% for assets held for less than three
years to 60% for assets held for ten years or
longer.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on estates at the
time of death and on gifts made within seven
years of death; most other lifetime transfers
are not taxed. There are several important
exemptions. Generally, transfers between
spouses are exempt, and gifts and bequests to
UK charities, major political parties and
heritage bodies are also normally exempt. In
general, business assets and farmland are
exempt from inheritance tax, so that most
family businesses can be passed on without a
tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40% above
a threshold: £231,000 in 1999-2000. Only
about 3% of estates a year become liable for an
inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax (VAT)
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax, with a
standard rate of 17.5%. A reduced rate of 5%
applies on domestic fuel and power, and on the
installation of energy-saving materials in low-
income households under government schemes.
VAT is collected at each stage in the production
and distribution of goods and services. The final
tax is payable by the consumer.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT is £51,000.
Certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT, either by being charged at a zero rate or
by being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
any VAT paid to suppliers. Among the
main categories where zero rating applies
are goods exported to other countries;
most food; water and sewerage for non¬
business use; domestic and international
passenger transport; books, newspapers
and periodicals; construction of new
residential buildings; young children’s
clothing and footwear; drugs and
medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people;
and certain supplies by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any VAT but is
not entitled to reclaim the VAT on goods
and services bought for his or her
business. The main categories where
exemption applies are many supplies of
land and buildings; insurance and other
financial services; postal services; betting;
gaming (with certain important
exceptions); lotteries; much education
and training; and health and welfare.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise dutv and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Mineral oils used as road fuel are subject to
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, and the Government has a
commitment to increase the duty on road fuels
by at least 6% a year in real terms, to help to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions (see p. 314).
However, there are reduced rates to encourage
the use of more environmentally friendly
fuels, such as unleaded petrol, ultra low
sulphur diesel, and gas used as road fuel.
Kerosene not used as road or motor fuel, most
lubricating oils and oils used for certain
industrial, horticultural and marine uses are
free of duty or attract very low rates. Fuel
substitutes are taxed at the same rate as the
corresponding mineral oil.
There are duties on spirits, beer, wine,
cider and other alcoholic drinks, charged
409
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
according to alcoholic strength and volume.
Spirits used for scientific, medical, research
and industrial processes are generally free of
duty.
Cigarette duty is charged partly as a cash
amount per cigarette and partly as a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other
tobacco products is based on weight. The
Government is committed to raising tobacco
duties by at least 5% a year in real terms, as
part of its policy of discouraging smoking (see
p. 186).
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. Duty is levied
either as a percentage of gross or net stakes or,
in the case of amusement machines, as a fixed
amount per machine according to the cost of
playing and the prize level. On the National
Lottery (see pp. 121-2) there is a 12% duty on
gross stakes, but no tax on winnings.
The annual vehicle excise duty on a
privately owned motor car, light van or taxi is
£155, with a lower rate of £100 for small cars
with engines up to 1,100 cc. The duty on goods
vehicles is levied on the basis of gross weight
and, if over 12 tonnes, according to the number
of axles. This is designed to ensure that such
vehicles at least cover their share of the full
costs of road use through the tax paid (VED
and fuel duty). Duty on taxis and buses varies
according to seating capacity, and duty on
motorcycles according to engine capacity.
Lower rates of VED apply for low-emission
lorries and buses. Privately owned vehicles—
cars, taxis, motorcycles and non-commercial
vehicles—built before 1973 are exempt from
VED. A graduated VED system will apply for
cars first registered after autumn 2000, based
primarily on their carbon dioxide emissions.
Insurance premium tax is levied on most
general insurance. The UK rate was raised
from 4% to 5% in July 1999, although this
remains one of the lowest overall rates in the
EU. A higher rate of 17.5% applies on travel
insurance and on insurance sold by suppliers
of cars and domestic appliances.
Air passenger duty is charged at £10 for
flights to internal destinations and to those in
the European Economic Area and £20
elsewhere.
A landfill tax is levied of £10 a tonne, with
a lower rate of £2 a tonne for inert waste. The
Government has announced that the main rate
will rise by £ 1 a tonne a year from April 2000
until at least 2004.
Stamp Duty
Some transfers are subject to stamp duty.
Transfers of shares attract duty at 0.5% of the
cost, while certain instruments, such as
declarations of trust, have small fixed duties of
50p or £1. Transfers by gift and transfers to
charities are exempt. Recent Budgets have
raised the rate of stamp duty on the transfers
of land and property (except shares) worth
over £250,000, in order to encourage stability
in the housing market. Duty on land and
property is now payable at 1% of the total
price when above £60,000, 2.5% above
£250,000 and 3.5% over £500,000.

Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates (sometimes known as business rates); and
sales, fees and charges. About 75% of
expenditure (excluding sales, fees and charges)
is financed by government grants and
redistributed non-domestic rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years. The non-domestic rate is set
nationally by the central bodies in England,
Wales and Scotland, and collected by local
authorities. It is paid into a national pool and
redistributed to local authorities in proportion
to their population. As part of its proposals for
410
PUBLIC FINANCE
modernising local government (see chapter 6),
the Government has suggested that local
authorities should be allowed to set a
supplementary local rate, subject to a
maximum of 5% of the national rate and to
the authorities demonstrating effective
consultation and partnership arrangements
with their local businesses.
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in April
1991. Discounts are available for dwellings with
fewer than two resident adults, and those on low
incomes may receive council tax benefit of up
to 100% of the tax bill (see p. 181).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.

Trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for hundreds of years.
Although it has less than 1% of the world’s population, the UK is the fourth
largest trading nation, accounting for around 5.7% of world trade in goods and
services. As one of 15 member states of the European Union (EU), the world’s
largest established trading group, over half of the UK’s trade is with fellow EU
members. The UK has a higher degree of inward and outward investment than
any of the other G7 economies, relative to gross domestic product (GDP), and is
second only to the United States as a destination for international direct
investment. The UK is encouraging the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to take
further action to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers and to liberalise world
markets, as well as supporting work on international competition policy
principles, trade and investment and investment liberalisation in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The UK exports more per head than the
United States and Japan. Its sales abroad of
goods and services were about 21% of total
final expenditure in 1998. Receipts from trade
in services (such as financial services, business
services, travel, transport and
communications) and investment income
make up about half of total British external
earnings, and the UK consistently runs large
surpluses on these accounts. The UK is the
world’s second biggest foreign investor and
British investors have more direct investment
abroad than overseas firms have in the UK.
TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES
In 1998, exports of UK goods amounted to
£164.1 billion and imports £184.9 billion, on a
balance of payments basis, giving a deficit on
trade in goods of £20.8 billion, up from £11.9
billion in 1997. This represented the biggest
annual deficit since 1989 and the third highest
on record (see Table 25.1). The change in the
deficit between the two years was largely
caused by a widening in the deficit with non-
EU countries, as economic difficulties in
South East Asia, Russia and oil-exporting
countries contributed to a fall of 4.5% in the
value of exports in 1998. The value of imports
rose marginally by 0.7% in 1998, reflecting
the continuing strength of sterling. Between
1997 and 1998 the volume of exports of goods
grew by 1.3%, while imports rose by 8.5%.

Commodity Composition
Traditionally the UK has been an exporter
of manufactured goods and an importer of
OVERSEAS TRADE AND INVESTMENT
At the turn of the 20th century, the United
Kingdom3 was still a large colonial power,
and this is reflected in data for the period for
trade in merchandise (goods). The value of
total imports in 1900 amounted to £523
million, while exports were £354 million,
giving a trade deficit of £169 million. Of
total exports, £291 million were British
produce and the remaining £63 million
Foreign and Colonial produce. Some 79% of
imports were from foreign countries, the
remaining 21% from British Possessions.
About 71% of exports were to foreign
countries, the remaining 29% to British
Possessions. In value terms, the largest
amount of imports by far were from the
United States (26.5%), followed by France
(10.3%), Australasia (6.8%), Germany and
Holland (both 6.0%). Germany was the
UK’s largest export market, taking 10.9% of
merchandise, followed by the United States
This included the whole of Ireland.
(10.5%), British India (8.7%) and
Australasia (8.3%).
By ‘article’, corn amounted to 11.3% of
total imports, raw cotton 7.8%, metals
7.6%, wood and timber 5.6% and wool
4.3%. Of British produced exports, cotton
accounted for 21.3%, ‘coals, etc.’ 13.9%,
metals 12.8%, machinery 6.2% and woollen
and worsted manufactures 5.4%. Of Foreign
and Colonial produced exports, wool, sheep,
lamb and llama accounted for 11.8%, metals
8.9%, cotton 8.5%, skins and furs 6.1% and
caoutchouc (raw rubber) 6.0%.
Some more interesting or obscure
imports included gutta percha—obtained
from the latex of various Malaysian trees
(£1.7 million), bananas (£0.5 million),
opium (£0.4 million) and brimstone (£0.1
million), while exports included ‘manures’
(£2.4 million) and condensed milk (£0.4
million).
food and basic materials. Manufactures
(finished manufactures and semi¬
manufactured goods) accounted for 84% of
UK exports in 1970. This declined with the
start of North Sea oil exports in the mid-
1970s, but has recovered subsequently, to
stand at over 86% in 1998 (see Table 25.2).
The UK has not had a surplus on
manufactured goods, however, since 1982.
Machinery and transport equipment
accounted for almost 48% of exports in 1998
and 45% of imports (see Table 25.3).

sectors, while textiles have declined in
relative importance. Sectors with a positive
balance of trade in 1998 included chemicals,
fuels, and beverages and tobacco.
Imported manufactures have taken a
greater share of the domestic market in recent
decades. Between 1970 and 1998 the share of
finished manufactures in total imports rose
from 25% to 60%, while the share of basic
materials fell from 15% to 3%. The
percentage of food, beverages and tobacco in
total imports has been dropping since the
1950s, down to less than 9% in 1998, as a
result of the extent to which food demand has
been met from domestic agriculture and of the
decline in the proportion of total expenditure
on food.
(see Table 25.4). In 1998 over 83% of UK
exports were with other OECD countries,1
and a similar percentage of imports came from
these same countries. The proportion of
export trade with the European Union was
over 58% in 1998, while imports from the EU
accounted for almost 55%. Western Europe as
a whole took 63% of UK exports in 1998.
EU countries accounted for eight of the top
ten export markets in 1998—the United
States and Japan took the other two places—
and seven of the top ten leading suppliers of
goods to the UK (see Table 25.5); the other
three places were taken by the United States,
Japan and Switzerland. The United States
maintained its position as the UK’s largest

external market for the second year running,
and overtook Germany as the UK’s largest
single supplier.
The financial crisis in Asia caused UK
exports to a number of Asia Pacific markets to
decline in 1998 compared with 1997.
However, there were small increases in a
number of European countries, notably the
Irish Republic, Italy and Spain. Total UK
imports in 1998 were 1% higher than in 1997,
but imports from the Netherlands showed a
significant increase of over 9%.
Services
A surplus has been recorded for trade in
services in every year since 1966. The £12.3
billion surplus recorded in 1998 (see Table
25.6) was slightly down on the record surplus
of £12.4 billion in 1997. Exports of services
grew by 4.4% to £60.1 billion, with
particularly strong growth in other business
services and travel. Imports of services grew
by 6.0% to £47.8 billion, mainly owing to
higher expenditure by UK travellers abroad.
OTHER TRANSACTIONS
Earnings on investment income on external
assets increased by 3.5% to £110.6 billion in
1998, while debits fell slightly by 0.3% to
£95.5 billion, giving a record surplus of £15.1
billion (see Table 25.7). This was largely
attributable to a record surplus on direct
investment income and a substantial fall in the
deficit on other investment income. The
surplus on direct investment income was
£18.0 billion, the highest on record, and an
increase of £3.0 billion on 1997. This was
partly offset by the deficit on other investment
income, which fell by £4.5 billion to £4.7
billion in 1998, the lowest since 1990.
Earnings on reserve assets for 1998 at £1.1
billion were £0.3 billion lower than in 1997.
The deficit on current transfers increased
from £5.1 billion to £6.5 billion in 1998,
largely owing to higher contributions to EU
institutions.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The UK’s balance of payments statistics
record transactions between residents of the
UK and non-residents. In 1998 the Office for
National Statistics’ United Kingdom Balance of
Payments—the Pink Book—made major
changes to the presentation of the accounts, to
bring them in line with international
standards.
The current account consists of trade in
goods and services, income (compensation of
employees and investment income) and
current transfers. In 1998, there was a small
current account surplus of £136 million (see
Table 25.8), a sharp decrease of £6.5 billion
on the highest ever surplus recorded in 1997.
An increase in income was more than offset by

INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY
The Government is committed to promoting
open world markets in goods and services, to
the further liberalisation of international direct
investment, and to improving the
transparency of international trade agreements
and the WTO itself. The UK plays a leading
role in achieving these objectives through
work in the WTO, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the OECD, as well as
the EU.
European Union
The single European market started trading in
1993. The Government’s work on this, and on
EU enlargement, seeks to create a commercial
and economic environment of open markets

for products, services, capital and labour
which encourages enterprise and supports
sustainable growth. It considers that the
market (see p. 81) is beneficial to the
economies of all member states of the EU, and
that removal of trade barriers will lead to
reduced business costs and greater
competition and efficiency. It is committed to
making progress on issues that would lead to
the completion of the single market, including
removing remaining barriers to investment,
opening up government procurement, making
competition policy more streamlined and
reducing bureaucracy. In the Government’s
view, specific advantages of the single market
include:
• wider consumer choice;
• removal of barriers to trade through
mutual recognition of standards and
harmonisation;
• the right to trade financial services
throughout the EU on the basis of a single
authorisation ‘passport’;
• mutual recognition of professional and
vocational qualifications; and
• a reduction in export business
bureaucracy.
In 1997 a Single Market Scoreboard was
introduced by the DTI and has proved
effective in showing progress in implementing
single market measures and in encouraging
better performance among member states.
Areas already identified in which the single
market could operate more strongly include
financial services, public procurement and
mutual recognition of standards. The
Government is promoting a process of
economic reform in the EU, with the goal of
further improvements in productivity,
investment and growth. It is also promoting
the principles of competitiveness and the
economic reform agenda to EU applicant
countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Through the agreements each applicant has
with the EU, these countries already enjoy
many of the benefits of the single market in
industrial goods. The Government is working
to ensure that by the time of their entry each
country has adopted all the measures required
of EU membership, and has the administrative
infrastructure to implement them.
The Government is playing an important
role in partnership with the Treasury’s Euro
Preparations Unit in helping British business
adjust to the introduction of the euro in 11 EU
member states (see p. 80).
World Trade Organisation
The level of industrial tariffs in developed
countries has fallen dramatically since the
establishment of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948. This set
of agreements helped establish a strong and
largely prosperous multilateral trading system
that became progressively more liberal
through the rounds of trade negotiations held
under its auspices. The eighth GATT Round
(the Uruguay round) of 1986-94 led to the
419
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
formation of the World Trade Organisation
and a new set of agreements. These
agreements encompassed not only tariffs but
also other areas covering trade in goods such
as subsidies, as well as trade in services and
intellectual property.
Under the WTO, trade liberalisation has
continued and the Government is working
towards the launching of a new trade round at
the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in
the United States at the end of 1999. The
Government wishes these negotiations to be
comprehensive, covering areas such as
investment, competition and trade facilitation.
It also believes that they should address the
needs of developing countries and least
developed countries, such as better market
access for their products and capacity
building.
The EU and the United States and Canada
are working to achieve a constructive way
forward in the dispute on the EU’s ban on the
import of hormone-treated beef from the US
and Canada (see p. 457). EU member states
have asked the European Commission to draft
legislation to reform the EU banana regime,
following the WTO ruling that it was
incompatible with world trade rules (see also
p. 457)
Relations with Other Countries
The UK places great importance on
developing strong relations with third
countries, in particular through the EU.
Examples include:
• the Transatlantic Economic Partnership
(TEP), where at the US/EU summit in
1998 the two partners agreed to reinforce
which provides an inter-regional forum
for dialogue between 25 Asian and
European countries together representing
half of global wealth. The UK has
worked in ASEM to build support for
keeping markets open, resisting
protectionism and pursuing further
multilateral liberalisation; and
• the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) works closely with the
Department for International
Development (DFID) in seeking to
ensure developing countries participate
more fully in international trade. The
mandate for the successor to the current
Lome Convention (see below)—the
framework for trade and aid relations
between the EU and 71 African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries—
includes a commitment that the new
trade and economic co-operation regime
should at least maintain current market
access from ACP countries.
Special Trading Arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EU’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential
trading arrangements with a number of
countries. These fall into three main
categories:
• Those that prepare countries in Central
and Eastern Europe for possible EU
membership. Europe (Association)
Agreements (see p. 85) are designed to
facilitate closer political and economic
ties and the eventual liberalisation of
trade with a view to these countries
becoming full members of the EU.
The EU has association and co-operating
agreements with virtually all non¬
member countries with a Mediterranean
coastline, plus Jordan. These provide for
the eventual setting up of a free trade
area between the EU and these countries
by 2010.
Those that provide an economic
dimension to its assistance to former
dependent territories. Trade relations
with these countries (known as ACP
countries) are governed by the Lome
their close relationship (see p. 87). The •
TEP should be instrumental in setting
the agenda for a more open and accessible
world trading system and at the same
time greatly improving the economic
relationship between the EU and the US,
by reducing bilateral frictions and
promoting prosperity on both sides of the •
Atlantic;
• the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM),

SCIENCE
The emergence of disease-causing bacteria able to resist all current antibiotics
poses a serious threat to human health. Genome analysis of microbes such as Streptomyces,
which have provided the majority of new antibiotics over the past 50 years, will aid
understanding of how antibiotics are made, and will provide tools for finding new antibiotics
as well as strategies for overcoming bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
The major impact that genomics will have in biomedical research and across
all biology-based industries was recognised in additional funding in the Science Budget allocations.
Colonies of Streptomyces.
Bluetongue Virus Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes an
economically important disease of cattle, sheep and deer
in many countries around the world. 1 he structure ol the
biochemically active core of the BTV virus particle has been
studied by X-ray crystallography in a collaborative study
between research groups led by Professor David Stuart at
the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford,
and Dr Peter Mertens at the Pirbright Laboratory
of the Institute for Animal Health. The BTV core is the
largest structure that has been analysed in such detail and
has provided a model for the structure and assembly for
other viruses within the family Reoviridae, including important
disease-causing agents of animals, plants and humans.
Mini Lake District
A set of tanks, each one metre
deep, is revealing important
clues as to how bigger lakes
may change as the Earth
continues to warm in the next
few decades. The 48 heated
tanks house an ecosystem and
allow the research team, all of
the School of Biological
Sciences at the University of
Liverpool, to investigate
directly the effects of global
warming on fresh shallow
waters.
Laser Interrogation of Tree Bark
As a result of industrial emissions,
potentially harmful elements are present
in the atmosphere and fine airborne
material can accumulate on tree bark
through wet and dry deposition.
During tree growth the bark can be
incorporated with the trunk forming a
so-called bark pocket. Interrogation and
analysis of bark pockets by laser
provides a new approach to measuring
historic levels of air pollution. This may
give an improved understanding of the
impact of human activity on the
environment.

SPACE
An image of the nearby universe as seen by the NASA infrared astronomical satellite. The bright band
along the middle is light from stars in our own Milky Way galaxy. The myriad of small dots are light from
external galaxies in the nearby universe. A team of UK astronomers measured the distance to 15,500
of these galaxies to produce the largest map known to man.
The Horsehead Nebula is one of the most
famous nebulae in the sky. Like clouds in
the Earth’s atmosphere, this cosmic cloud
has assumed a recognisable shape by chance.
After many thousands of years, the internal
motions of the cloud will alter its appearance.
The photograph was taken by the Anglo-
Australian Telescope which is funded by the
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research
Council (see p. 437).

observable universe. Work on both maps is
carried out by a consortium of UK universities
led by Dr W. Saunders of the University of
Edinburgh.

Convention, which gives them tariff-free
access, subject to certain safeguards, to
the EU for industrial and agricultural
products. The EU also operates a
Generalised System of Preferences which
is available to nearly all developing
countries and applies to industrial
products, including textiles and certain
(mainly processed) agricultural products.
New trade relationships with countries and
regions of Latin America are being pursued.
Work is in progress on developing a free trade
agreement with Mexico, and negotiations for
new agreements with the Mercosur regional
economic area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay) and Chile are under way.
Partnership and co-operation (non-
preferential) agreements have been concluded
with ten states of the former Soviet Union.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements
have also been made with countries in South
Asia and Latin America, as well as the
People’s Republic of China, the Association of
South East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact,
and the Central American States.
Controls on Trade
Import Controls
Following the completion of the single
European market, all national quantitative
restrictions have been abolished. However,
some EU-wide quotas have been imposed on a
small range of products from the People’s
Republic of China, while EU imports of some
steel products from Russia, the Ukraine and
Kazakhstan are also restricted. Quantitative
restrictions on textiles and clothing stem from
the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), under
which there is a series of bilateral agreements.
Some quotas are also maintained for imports
from non-WTO countries. The MFA
restrictions will be eliminated by 2005 as part
of the Uruguay Round agreement.
Imports from certain countries remain
subject to sanctions or embargo agreed by, for
example, the United Nations. Imports of
certain other goods from all countries are
prohibited or restricted in order to protect
human, animal or plant life and health. These
include firearms and ammunition; nuclear
materials; certain drugs; explosives;
endangered wildlife and derived products;
pornographic material; and certain
agricultural, horticultural and food products.
Export Controls
The great majority of UK exports are not
subject to any government control. However,
controls on certain strategic goods—
conventional military goods, arms,
ammunition and related materials as well as
dual-use industrial goods that can be used for
civil and military purposes—are imposed for a
variety of reasons, including foreign policy
and non-proliferation concerns, the need to
comply with international treaty
commitments, the operation of sanctions and
national security. The scope of export controls
is limited to what is necessary to meet these
concerns. Most controls apply on a worldwide
basis, although certain sanctions and
embargoes are applied against specific
countries as a result of agreement by members
of bodies such as the United Nations.
The Government is strongly committed to
preventing the proliferation of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons—weapons of
mass destruction—and missiles capable of
delivering such weapons. It works closely with
the relevant international organisations in this
area, while seeking to ensure that the UK
meets its own international obligations without
imposing unnecessary burdens on business.
Licences to export arms and other goods
controlled for strategic reasons are issued by
the DTI acting through its Export Control
Organisation (ECO). All licence applications
are circulated to other departments with an
interest, including the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office (FCO), Ministry of
Defence and DFID. The ECO is also the
licensing authority for applications to export
goods controlled to certain destinations only,
such as Iraq, because of specific trade sanctions
imposed in accordance with resolutions of the
UN Security Council.
A White Paper on Strategic Export Controls
published in 1998 contained proposals for new
primary legislation and improvements to
export licensing procedures, including
provision for parliamentary scrutiny of the
421
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
DTFs export licensing decisions, and the
introduction of powers enabling government
to impose controls on the transfer of
technology by intangible means such as
trafficking and brokering.
Inward and Outward Investment
The UK has an open economy, and there are no
restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
Outward investment helps to develop markets
for UK exports while providing earnings in the
form of investment income (see p. 415). Inward
investment is promoted by the Invest in Britain
Bureau (IBB—see below), which reports jointly
to the DTI and the FCO. This investment is
seen as a means of introducing new technology,
products and management styles to the UK,
and creating or safeguarding employment.
Inward Investment
Inward investment is a significant contributor
to the British economy. The UK attracts over
one-third of all inward investment into the
EU, and overseas businesses investing in
Britain generate an estimated 50% of UK
exports. Some 5,000 US, 1,000 Japanese and
3,000 French and German companies are
located in the UK.
During 1998-99, the UK retained its place
as the leading location in Europe for inward
investment. In addition, the latest national
inward investment results, for 1998—99,
showed a record level of UK successes with
652 projects, creating 44,000 new jobs and
safeguarding another 74,000.
The IBB co-ordinates the promotion of
inward investment, operating overseas
through diplomatic posts and in the UK
through its partners in Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and the English regions:
• Regional Development Agencies in
England (see p. 11);
• Locate in Scotland, operated jointly by
the Scottish Executive and Scottish
Enterprise;
• the Welsh Development Agency’s
International Division; and
• the Industrial Development Board for
Northern Ireland.
About 40% of new investment in the UK
comes from companies who already have a
UK presence. North America continues to be
the largest source of inward investment,
followed by Japan. The UK receives about
23% of total EU direct investment, including
38% of investment from the United States
and 40% from Japan. In addition to more
established sectors, such as the automotive
sector, which have traditionally brought a high
number of jobs, the UK increasingly attracts
high value-added investment in ‘leading edge’
sectors. In 1999 the UK has won the following
investments with significant help from the
overseas investment teams and the IBB:
• Novartis of Switzerland, a world leader
in life sciences and employing over 3,000
people across 14 UK R&D sites, is
investing an additional XjlOO million in
UK properties, including £40 million on
a world-class respiratory centre in
Horsham, West Sussex;
• Universal Scientific Industrial of Taiwan is
establishing an IT manufacturing project in
Irvine, Ayrshire (creating 700 jobs);
• US-owned Pfizer has opened a new £6.2
million quality operations facility in
Sandwich, Kent; and
• Toshiba established a laboratory in
Bristol to work on the next generation of
mobile telephones.
Advantages to overseas investors of preferring
Britain include its membership of the single
European market, a flexible and adaptable
workforce, good labour relations, low taxation, a
respected legal system and the English language.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government provides a wide range of
advice and practical support to meet the needs
of exporters. This support is designed to help
businesses, especially small and medium-sized
enterprises, through all stages of the exporting
process.
British Trade International
British Trade International (BTI) has lead
responsibility within government for trade

development and promotion on behalf of
British business. It brings together the joint
work of the FCO and the DTI in support of
British trade and investment overseas. It
combines in a single operation all trade
development and promotion work currently
undertaken locally in the English regions by
the Business Link network (see p. 390); trade
support services provided nationally; and the
commercial work overseas of over 200
embassies and other diplomatic posts.
BTI was established in May 1999 following
a Cabinet Office review of all export
promotion activities across government. The
review involved wide consultation with
industry and business organisations, and
recommended some far-reaching changes in
the way official support for overseas trade and
investment is organised. These are being
implemented over the next two years. Key
priorities include:
• developing a national strategy which will
provide clear direction to all parts of
government on trade promotion and
development;
• putting in place a new structure which
will enable the team at home and overseas
to function as a single organisation; and
• developing a strong brand for trade
promotion services to ensure that
businesses know what BTI can offer to
help them win business overseas.
The Chief Executive reports to the Foreign
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, and to the Board of BTI,
chaired jointly by FCO and DTI ministers. A
majority of the Board’s members are from
business and have wide experience of
international trade.
One of BTI’s first tasks is preparation of
the national strategy, which will underpin not
only its own programmes and priorities but
also those of other organisations working in
support of Britain’s exporters and overseas
investors. BTFs strategy will cover the UK,
and the administrations in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland will play a full role in its
development; each of the administrations has a
member on BTI’s Board.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department), Britain’s official export credit
agency, is a separate government department
responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry. It helps exporters of UK goods
and services to overcome the risks involved in
selling and investing abroad. This is achieved
primarily by providing medium and long-term
export credit support (insurance and backing
for finance) for capital goods and projects. It
also provides reinsurance for exports sold on
short terms of payment, and political risk
insurance for overseas investments.
In 1997-98, ECGD issued guarantees for
new business (exports and overseas
investments) of ^3.4 billion. It also made a
cash contribution to the Exchequer of £445
million, achieved a high level of recoveries
(£517 million) and experienced a continued
fall in claims to £159 million. ECGD aims to
be flexible and innovative in developing
solutions to individual problems, and offers
simple packages for the more straightforward
deals. UK exporters also benefit from the
extensive network of co-operation agreements
that ECGD now has with export credit
agencies in other countries.

More Nobel Prizes for science (over 70) have been won by scientists from
Britain than any country except the United States. The United Kingdom funds
about 4.5% of global research and development (R&D) and produces about 8%
of scientific publications. Government policy aims to reinforce the UK s
international scientific standing; and maximise the contribution of science,
engineering and technology (SET) to economic competitiveness and the quality
of life by promoting innovation.
BACKGROUND
The public sector is the prime funder of basic
science in Britain. As well as playing a crucial
part in advancing scientific knowledge and
producing well-trained people, such research
can often lead to unexpectedly exploitable
results. Business has the prime responsibility for
researching and developing new and improved
products and services. Government promotes
the climate for the development and successful
exploitation of new ideas through, for example,
the Foresight Programme (which encourages
partnerships between industry and the UK’s
science base—see p. 427), and tries to facilitate
technology transfer and access. Industry is
being encouraged to invest more in R&D and to
take a longer-term view of R&D investment.
The Government’s policies for science,
engineering and technology were set out in the
Competitiveness White Paper in December
1998 and were reflected in the Comprehensive
Spending Review (see p. 400). This provided
for an increase of 11% in real terms between
1998_99 and 2001-02 for spending in this area.
The European Union (EU) launched the F ifth
Framework Programme, a further round of its
collaborative R&D programme, in April 1999.
The objectives of this programme fit well with
the UK’s priorities of increased competitiveness
and higher quality of life (see p. 434).
Recent pioneering work in the UK includes
the discovery in 1985 by British Antarctic
Survey scientists of the hole in the ozone layer
over the Antarctic. Researchers at the
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge,
produced the first monoclonal antibodies—
proteins with enormous potential in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease. Among
British breakthroughs in genetics research are
the identification of the gene in the Y
chromosome responsible for determining sex,
and of other genes linked to diseases such as
cystic fibrosis and a form of breast cancer. The

SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
At the beginning of the 20th century UK
science was particularly strong in physics
and chemistry, and in many branches of
biology and medicine. Mathematics,
psychology and philosophy were other
fertile areas of scientific endeavour.
Among just a few examples of notable
British discoveries around the turn of the
century:
• The existence of the electron was
established in 1897 by the physicist
Sir Joseph Thomson, who won a
Nobel Prize in 1906.
• In 1902 E.H. Stirling and W.M.
Bayliss, both physiologists, isolated
the hormone secretin, which aids
digestion.
• Sir William Ramsay, working with
Lord Rayleigh, discovered argon in
1895 and went on to identify the rest
of the family of inert gases (helium,
neon, krypton, xenon and radon).
Ramsay and Rayleigh shared a Nobel
Prize in 1904.
• Another Nobel Prize-winner was
Ernest Rutherford, the New Zealand-
born English physicist. He made
fundamental discoveries concerning
the nature of radioactivity, and
deduced the existence of the nucleus
in 1906.
• Sir Ronald Ross, a surgeon (Nobel
Prize, 1902), confirmed the theory of
the bacteriologist Sir Patrick Manson
that mosquitoes transmit malaria,
when he discovered the human
malaria parasite in the stomach wall of
an anopheles mosquito.
British engineering was also making
exceptional progress: the first electric
underground railway opened in London in
1890; Sir Charles Parsons, having invented
the steam turbine in 1884, fitted one to
Turbinia in 1897, making it the fastest boat
of the time (35 knots); and Sir John
Ambrose Fleming, an authority on electro¬
magnetism, constructed the first rectifying
diode in 1904, which greatly stimulated the
development of radio.
world’s first pig with a genetically modified
heart was bred by scientists at Cambridge
University, an important milestone in
breeding animals as organ donors for people.
In 1997 scientists at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh announced that they had
succeeded in ‘cloning’ a sheep (‘Dolly the
Sheep’) using a cell from an adult sheep’s
mammary gland. Professor Sir Harold Kroto
of Sussex University shared the 1996 Nobel
Prize for chemistry with two US scientists for
discovering in 1985 the fullerene molecule—
60 carbon atoms arranged in a symmetrical
cage. Potential uses for fullerene and for
materials derived from it include high-
temperature superconductors, drugs, ultra¬
strong fibres, super-slippery lubricants,
lightweight magnets and electronic
superconductors.
Other notable areas of UK achievement in
R&D include biotechnology, materials,
chemicals, electronics and aerospace. Among
the many achievements in British research
reported in the first half of 1999, which may
have far-reaching consequences, are:
• The discovery by scientists at
Horticultural Research International at
Wellesbourne (Warwickshire) of a strain
of bacteria that degrades phenylureas, the
most widely used herbicide family in
Europe. Spraying these bacteria into the
soil could greatly reduce the amount of
chemicals leaking from fields into
streams and harming fish.
• The development at the National
Medical Laser Centre at University

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURE
Gross domestic expenditure in the UK on
R&D in 1997 was ^14.7 billion, 1 .8% of gross
domestic product (GDP). Of this, £12.5
billion was on civil R&D, with the rest going
to defence projects.
Industry provided 49% of total funding
and government 32% in 1997; a further
15% came from abroad. Significant
contributions were also made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. As well as
financing R&D carried out within industry
itself, industry supports university research
and finances contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations (see
p. 439) carry out R&D for companies and are
playing an increasingly important role in the
transfer of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R&D in industry
amounted to nearly £9.6 billion in 1997. Of
this total, industry’s own contribution was
71%, with 10% coming from government
and virtually all of the rest from overseas.
The chemistry and biotechnology-based
sectors—chemicals, pharmaceuticals and
healthcare—account for almost a third of
R&D spending by listed companies; the
electronics and aerospace sectors are also big
investors in R&D. The three biggest
investors in R&D—Glaxo Wellcome,
SmithKline Beecham and AstraZeneca—all

GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science, engineering and technology base
issues are the responsibility of a Cabinet
minister at the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI), assisted by a Minister for
Science; they are supported by the Office of
Science and Technology (OST). A Ministerial
Science Group has been created across
government to ensure that SET are taken into
account in the development of government
policy. The OST, headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, is
responsible for policy on SET, both nationally
and internationally, and co-ordinates science
and technology policy across government
departments. The Chief Scientific Adviser
also reports directly to the Prime Minister. An
independent Council for Science and
Technology advises the Prime Minister on the
strategic policies and framework for science
and technology in the UK. Its members are
drawn from academia, business and charitable
foundations/institutions.
426
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the Research
Councils together with the national and
international central facilities (such as
CERN—see p. 435) supported by the
Councils and available for use by British
scientists and engineers. There are also
important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities.
The science and engineering base is the main
provider of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to have
practical applications) carried out in the UK.
It also collaborates with the private sector in
the conduct of specific applied research.
The OST, through the Director General of
Research Councils, has responsibility for the
Science Budget, and for the government-
financed Research Councils (see pp. 436—9).
Through the Research Councils, the Science
Budget supports research in the following
ways: by awarding research grants to
universities, other higher education
establishments and some other research units;
by funding Research Council establishments
to carry out research or provide facilities; by
paying subscriptions to international scientific
facilities and organisations; and by supporting
postgraduate research students and
postdoctoral Fellows. The Science Budget
also funds programmes of support to the
science and engineering base through the
Royal Society and the Royal Academy of
Engineering. The other main sources of funds
for universities are the higher education
funding councils (see p. 135).
Strategy and Finance
Planned total government expenditure on SET
(both civil and defence) in 1999-2000 is ^7.1
billion. This represents an increase of about 7%
in real terms over the estimated outturn of
expenditure in 1998-99. Of the 1999-2000
total, £4.1 billion is devoted to civil science,
including £1.5 billion for the Science Budget.
In 1998, the Government announced that it
was providing an additional £1 billion for the
science and engineering base between 1999
and 2002—£700 million through the Science
Budget and £300 million through the
Department for Education and Employment.
A further £400 million will be provided by the
Wellcome Trust. About £700 million of the
extra funding, including £300 million of the
Wellcome contribution, will be devoted to
uprating university laboratories and other
essential equipment (see p. 435). Another
£400 million will be used by the Research
Councils to support research in priority areas
such as life sciences (including genetic
research, medical science and biotechnology).
Among government departments, the
Ministry of Defence (see p. 432) has the
largest research budget.
The Foresight Programme
The funding and organisation of British SET
aims to create a close partnership between
government, industry and the scientific
community in developing strengths in areas of
importance to the future economic well-being
of Britain. In particular, the Government’s
Foresight Programme encourages the public
and private sectors to work together to
identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next ten
to 20 years that would support sustainable
growth, and the actions needed to exploit
them. Government priorities in SET
programmes, and in overall policy, regulation
and education and training, are being guided
by the Programme.
The Foresight Programme is co-ordinated
by a joint industry/academic steering group
headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser.
Building on the first round (1994-99), a
second Foresight round was launched in April
1999. This has three thematic panels and ten
sectoral panels, made up of people from
industry, academia and government. The
panels will produce visions of the future which
might drive wealth creation and shape the
quality of life. The thematic panels will
address the issues of ageing population, crime
prevention and manufacturing in 2020. The
sectoral panels will be focused on business
sectors or broader areas, and they will carry
forward the work of existing panels and tackle
new issues.
427
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Government departments, universities and
higher education funding councils, as well as
the Research Councils, are reflecting
Foresight priorities in their research spending
allocations. The private sector is being
encouraged to take account of the priorities
both in its participation in collaborative
research programmes and in its own strategic
planning. The Government provided £30
million over four years for the first round of
the Foresight Challenge Competition, to fund
collaborative R&D projects which address
priorities identified by the Foresight panels.
This was complemented by a further £62
million from private sector project
participants. In addition, more than £300
million or so has already been channelled into
other Foresight initiatives.
A ‘Knowledge Poof has been established
as an integral part of the second round of
Foresight. This is an electronic library of
strategic visions, information and views
about the future. It is believed to be the
world’s first professional knowledge
management service freely accessible to the
general public. Its aim is to help build new
partnerships and stimulate new thinking
by bringing together people with
complementary and conflicting views of
the future. It provides a fully searchable,
single point of access to the work of
Foresight panels and to most government
scientific information available on the
worldwide web. It also includes
information from many other UK and
overseas sources. The Knowledge Pool can
be accessed through the Internet at the
www.foresight.gov.uk website.
EQUAL—Extend Quality Life
One of the principal issues facing the UK in
the years ahead is a growing elderly population
(see p. 107). Life expectancy has risen, but has
not been matched by an increase in years free
from disability or illness. The EQUAL
scheme focuses research and develops
technologies to improve the quality of life of
an ageing population. It spans the activities of
all the Research Councils, from medical and
life sciences to social and materials research,
drawing together issues identified in the
Foresight Programme.
ROPA and CASE
The Realising Our Potential Award (ROPA)
scheme, administered by the Research
Councils, is designed to encourage academic
researchers to develop strategic links with
industry and to stimulate new areas of ‘blue
skies’ or ‘curiosity-driven’ research. Since the
introduction of the ROPA scheme in 1994,
1,373 projects have been approved involving a
total research investment of £123 million. The
Government also makes funds available
through the Research Councils for the Co¬
operative Awards in Science and Engineering
(CASE) scheme, which supports postgraduate
students on research projects jointly
supervised with industry.
LINK
The LINK scheme, including Foresight
LINK Awards, provides a government-wide
framework for collaborative research in
support of sustainable growth and
improvements in the quality of life, in line
with Foresight priorities. LINK aims to
promote partnerships in commercially
relevant research projects between industry
and higher education institutions and other
research base organisations. Under the
scheme, government departments and
Research Councils fund up to 50% of the cost
of research projects, with industry providing
the balance.
Since 1988, 62 LINK programmes have
supported over 1,000 projects with a total
value of more than £500 million (over half of
which comes from industry) and involving
over 1,500 companies. The latest programmes
deal with: Food Quality and Safety; Oil and
Gas Extraction; Management of Information
for Fraud Control; and Ocean Margins.
Eighteen new Foresight Link Awards, with a
total value of £20 million, include: use of
small-scale reactors in chemical and
biochemical analysis and synthesis;
428
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
researching spectral imaging tools for the
evaluation of contaminated sites; and
fuel-control sensors to help reduce aircraft
pollution.
Joint Research Equipment Initiative
The Joint Research Equipment Initiative brings
together the higher education funding councils,
the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland and the Research Councils. It directs
funds for research equipment in strategic
priority areas. Since 1996 over £200 million of
public and private money has been committed
for ‘leading edge’ equipment for UK
universities and colleges. A further £27 million
was announced for a fourth round in 1999.
Joint Infrastructure Fund
The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) is a ‘one-
ofP programme to address the infrastructure
problems of universities and was created by
the Wellcome Trust and the DTI, each
contributing £300 million. The Higher
Education Funding Council for England has
also contributed £100 million, raising the total
fund to £700 million. In the first round of
awards in May 1999, £150 million was
allocated to over 20 universities. Successful
bids ranged from an optical/infrared telescope
capable of mapping huge tracts of the universe
to a state-of-the-art vaccine centre. There will
be further rounds of awards in late 1999 and in
2000 and 2001.
University Challenge Fund
The University Challenge Fund is a
competitive scheme which offers financing to
universities to help them in the early stages of
turning research into commercial products.
The first round involves over £60 million of
investment funds: the Government has
contributed £20 million, the Wellcome Trust
up to £18 million and the Gatsby Charitable
Foundation £2 million, with the remainder to
be raised by the universities themselves.
Following a large number of high-quality
applications, the Government announced an
additional contribution of £15 million: £5
million for the first round and £10 million for
a second round. So far 15 university-based
consortia, involving more than 30 universities
and research institutes, have been awarded up
to £45 million for projects aimed at turning
their science base into valuable products,
processes and services.
Science Enterprise Challenge
The Science Enterprise Challenge was launched
in February 1999 as a £25 million competition
to establish up to eight centres of enterprise in
UK universities. Universities were invited to
submit proposals for establishing world-class
centres that would foster the commercialisation
of research and new ideas, stimulate scientific
entrepreneurialism, and incorporate the
teaching of enterprise into the science and
engineering curricula. Winners of the
competition are due to be announced in autumn
1999; the centres are expected to make a
significant contribution to the development of
the enterprise culture in the UK.
Public Awareness
The Government seeks to raise the status of
SET among the general public, by increasing
awareness of the contribution of SET to the
UK’s economic wealth and quality of life.
Raising awareness is important in encouraging
young people to pursue careers in science and
engineering. To this end, the Government
supports activities such as the annual science
festival of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science (BAAS) and the
National Week of Science, Engineering and
Technology. The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up
by the Royal Society, the BAAS and the Royal
Institution (see p. 440), acts as a co-ordinator
for those fostering public understanding and
promotes best practice in the field.
Science festivals are also a growing feature
of local co-operative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions and
industry contribute to a variety of special
events. The longest-established single-location
429
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
science festival is the annual Edinburgh
International Science Festival.
Activities such as these are important in
assuring continued interest in SET among
young people making educational and career
choices. They also help to enhance the
public’s ability to relate to scientific issues in
general and to make informed judgments
about scientific developments. DTI has
started to investigate public attitudes through
a Public Consultation on Developments in
Biosciences and will continue with a broader,
fundamental review of public understanding
in late 1999 and early 2000.
More than 150,000 people visited the
Edinburgh Science Festival in April 1999.
Presentations included an enormous
bazooka made from a drainpipe which
fired a potato at 250 kilometres per hour
through a tennis racquet strung with
titanium wire to produce the world’s
fastest French fries; and a bicycle anyone
could ride across a tightrope—the 85 kg
counterweight slung below the rope made
it impossible to fall off. Other attractions
popularising science and engineering
included Formula One racing cars, and
demonstrations of uses of artificial
intelligence and the solar eclipse.
Women
The Promoting SET for Women Unit within
OST at the DTI was established in 1994 in
response to a report which found that women
were under-represented in the SET sectors,
especiallv at senior levels. The Unit has
highlighted the benefits to business of
providing a working environment sensitive to
the needs of women scientists and engineers
who combine a career and family
responsibilities. It seeks to ensure that careers
information for girls and women is widely
available and to promote good employment
practices, such as the provision of childcare
facilities and job sharing. A website
(www.set4women.gov.uk) has been launched
promoting SET for girls and women and
giving details of the Unit’s activities.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation
through the promotion of a national and
international system for the establishment of
intellectual property rights. These matters are
the responsibility of the Patent Office, an
executive agency of the DTI. The Office is
responsible for the granting of patents, and
design and trade mark registrations. The
Patent Office encourages worldwide
harmonisation of rules and procedures, and
the modernisation and simplification of
intellectual property law. International
patenting arrangements include the European
Patent Convention and the Patent Co¬
operation Treaty. For trade marks the
European Community Trade Mark System
and the Madrid Protocol provide means of
extending rights beyond the borders of the
United Kingdom.
R&D’s important role in a knowledge-
driven economy is further recognised in an
intellectual property rights action plan set out
in the Competitiveness \\ hite Paper (see
p. 390), which focuses on making these rights
more affordable and accessible. The Patent
Office website offers detailed information
about all aspects of intellectual property rights
and is a major link between the Office and its
customers.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
In 1999-2000 DTFs planned expenditure on
SET is £340 million, including £62 million on
technology transfer and access. This covers
innovation and technology, aeronautics, space
(see p. 433), and nuclear and non-nuclear
energy. DTI is committed to helping UK
businesses successfully exploit their ideas, and
to promoting a business environment to
encourage this. To this end, the Government
has increased DTFs Innovation Budget over
the next three years by more than 20%, rising
to £230 million by 2002.
Innovation embraces the development,
design and financing of new products, services
and processes, exploitation of new markets,
creation of new businesses and associated
430
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
changes in management of people and
organisational practices. Through its
Innovation Lnit, a mixed team of business
secondees and government officials, DTI
seeks to promote a culture of innovation in all
sectors of the economy. In Northern Ireland
the Industrial Research and Technolog}- Unit
has a similar role to that of the DTI,
supporting industrial R&D, technology
transfer and innovation.
Technology and Knowledge Transfer
DTI aims to increase collaboration and the
flow of knowledge between the science,
engineering and technology base and
businesses; improve access to sources of
technology and technological expertise;
improve the capacity of business to use
technology effectively; and increase the uptake
of the latest technolog}- and best practice
techniques.
One example of a technolog} and
knowledge transfer mechanism is TCS
(formerly known as the Teaching Companv
Scheme); this is funded by six government
departments and five Research Councils as
well as by the participating companies. At anv
one time there are nearly 700 TCS
programmes, each involving one or more
graduates working in a company on a project
that is central to its business needs. Each TCS
programme lasts for at least two years and
projects are jointly supervised by personnel
from the knowledge base and the companv.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
are involved in around 90% of TCS
programmes. The Competitiveness White
Paper announced a commitment by DTI to
double its expenditure on TCS. The TCS
scheme now has a common advisor}- board
with LINK (see p. 428) to help increase the
number of TCS programmes following on
from LINK-funded research.
To help UK companies remain competitive
in an increasingly global market, the DTI’s
International Technolog}- Service (ITS)
enables U K companies to become aware of
and gain access to new technological
developments and management practices not
present in the UK. The ITS highlights
developments and opportunities overseas
through a monthly publication; and assists
companies to access technology, set up
licensing agreements and collaborative
ventures, and to gain first-hand experience of
new technology and leading management
practices.
Smart—Small Firms Merit Award for Research
and Technology
Smart helps individuals and SMEs research,
develop or acquire the technologies needed to
bring innovative products to the market. Help
is available for feasibility studies into
innovative technology and for development
projects, to develop up to prototype stage new
products and processes. During 1999, three
new elements have been introduced to Smart:
micro-projects to help very small firms and
entrepreneurs develop low-cost prototypes
and secure intellectual property rights;
technolog}- reviews using external expertise to
improve use of technology; and technology
studies with external expertise to identify
technolog}- opportunities. Business Links (see
p. 390) have an important role in generating
suitable feasibility studies and development
projects, and in helping firms to submit
applications. Separate Smart schemes are
operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Aeronautics
The DTFs Civil Aircraft Research and
Technolog}- Demonstration Programme
(CARAD) supports research and technology
demonstration in aeronautics. In 1999-2000,
the CARAD budget is £20 million. The
programme is an essential part of a national
aeronautics research effort, with almost half
of the supported research work being
conducted in industry, and around a third at
the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency
(see p. 432). Universities and other research
organisations receive about 10% of funding.
The remainder represents the UK’s
contribution (shared with MoD) to the
European Transonic Windtunnel in Cologne.
CARAD and earlier programmes have
supported a range of projects, including:
aluminium and composite airframe materials;
431
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
more efficient and environmentally friendly
engines; and advanced aircraft systems.
Measurement Standards
The DTI finances the maintenance and
development of new measurement standards
under the National Measurement System
(NMS—see p. 392) and materials metrology
programmes. Most of the work is carried out
at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL),
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist
(LGC) and the National Engineering
Laboratory (NEL). Spending about £38
million a year, the NMS provides the
infrastructure to ensure that measurements
can be made on a consistent basis throughout
the UK. The accelerating pace of
technological change and the greater
awareness of the importance of quality and
innovation have led to increasing demands for
measurement standards and calibrations.
Ministry of Defence
The MoD has the largest government research
and development budget—£2,619 million for
1999-2000, of which about £600 million is for
medium- and long-term applied research
relevant to military needs. Since the end of the
Cold War, the Government has been
committed to achieving a gradual reduction in
real terms in spending on defence R&D.
The Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA) is the largest single scientific
employer in the UK. Its role is to supply
scientific and technical services primarily to
the MoD but also to other government
departments. DERA has set up five dual-use
(civil-military) technology centres in subjects
ranging from structural materials to high-
performance computing, to enhance the
degree of collaboration between DERA,
industry and the academic science base.
DERA subcontracts research to industry
and universities, and works closely with
industry to ensure that scientific and
technological advances are integrated at an
early stage into development and production.
This technology transfer is not just confined
to the defence industry but has also led to
important ‘spin-offs’ into civil markets, in
fields ranging from new materials and
electronic devices to advanced aerodynamics.
The latter in particular has helped to give the
UK a leading role in civil aircraft design.
Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)
The DETR funds research in response to the
requirements of all its major policy
responsibilities: environmental protection;
housing; construction; regeneration; the
countryside; local and regional government;
planning; roads and local transport; and
railways, aviation and shipping. Total
expenditure for 1999-2000 is £169 million
(including spending by executive agencies and
non-departmental public bodies—NDPBs).
Major programmes of industrial support aim
to benefit the construction sector and to help
British industry’s adoption of energy-efficient
technologies. Through the Darwin Initiative
(see p. 326), British expertise is being made
available to assist countries that are rich in
biodiversity but have insufficient financial or
technical resources to implement the
Biodiversity Convention.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF)
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with devolved administrations, the Research
Councils and other public bodies in related
areas. The programme supports the
Ministry’s wide-ranging responsibilities for
protecting the public, especially in food safety
and quality; protecting and enhancing the
rural and marine environment; flooding and
coastal defence; animal health and welfare; and
improving the economic performance of the
agriculture, fishing and food industries. The
budget for research expenditure in 1999-2000
is £142 million, including support for the
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see p. 441).
Department of Health (DH)
The DH’s R&D strategy aims to provide the
evidence needed to inform policy and practice in
432
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
public health, healthcare and social care. It
delivers this objective through two
complementary programmes: the Policy
Research Programme (PRP), and the National
Health Service (NHS) R&D Programme. The
DH also oversees the research programmes of the
health-related NDPBs. The Department expects
to spend about £141 million in 1999-2000 (£70
million on the NHS R&D Programme, £31
million on the PRP, £34 million by the NDPBs
and about £6 million from other DH R&D
budgets). In addition, through the NHS R&D
levy, the Department supports NHS providers
involved in research, helping to underpin the
research, including clinical trials, of other
funding bodies such as the Medical Research
Council and research charities, taking place in the
NHS. This expenditure is expected to be £360
million in 1999-2000.
Tackling inequalities in health is one of the
Government’s top priorities (see p. 185).
Research projects with a particular focus on
children and young people are now under way
funded through DH’s health inequalities
research programme.
Department for International
Development (DFID)
DFID commissions and sponsors knowledge
generation in natural resources, environment,
health and population, engineering, education
and social sciences. Financial provision for this
in 1999—2000 is £119 million, covering
research projects addressing particular
development problems and projects to improve
research, and research capacity relevant to
particular countries. DFID also contributes to
international centres and programmes
generating knowledge on development issues.
These contributions include support for the
EU Science and Technology for Development
programme, which sponsors research in
renewable natural resources, agriculture,
health and information technologies, and for
the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
Scottish Executive
The Scottish Executive has a budget of about
£250 million for research-related spending.
Some £75 million of this encourages and funds
agricultural and fisheries research, and related
biological, food, environmental, economic and
social science—most goes to the Scottish
Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes,
the Fisheries Research Services and the Scottish
Agricultural College. In many areas—electrical
and electronic engineering, medicine,
agriculture and biological sciences, fisheries and
marine science—Scotland’s science base has an
international reputation for research excellence.
About £135 million goes to Scottish research
institutions from the UK Research Councils.
The Scottish Executive Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Department encourages the
development of science-based industry, for
example, by promoting and administering
government and EU industrial R&D schemes.
The enterprise network in Scotland—Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise
and LECs (see chapter 23)—addresses the
need for innovation and technology transfer,
both through grant support for innovation and
through a wide range of initiatives.
Space Activities
The UK’s civil space programme is brought
together through the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership of government
departments and the Research Councils.
BNSC’s key aims are to develop practical and
economic uses of space, to promote the
competitiveness of British space companies in
world markets and to maintain the UK’s
position in space science. These are realised
primarily by collaboration with other
European nations through the European
Space Agency (ESA).
Through BNSC, the Government spends
around £200 million a year on space activities.
About two-thirds of this is channelled through
ESA for collaborative programmes on Earth
observation, telecommunications and space
science, much of which returns to the UK
through contracts awarded to British industry.
The remaining one-third of the space budget
is spent on international meteorological
programmes carried out through the
European Meteorological Satellite
Organisation (EUMETSAT) and on the
national programme, which is aimed at

complementing R&D supported through
ESA. Around half of the British space
programme is concerned with satellite-based
Earth observation (remote-sensing) for
commercial and environmental applications.
The UK is also a major contributor to
ESA’s latest Earth observation satellite,
ENVISAT, due to be launched in 2000. This
will carry a new generation of radar and
radiometer systems as well as other scientific
environmental instruments, some of which
have been either designed or constructed in
Britain. The complete satellite was assembled
by the UK-French space company, Matra
Marconi Space. British companies are also
leading the development of microsatellites.
A quarter of the UK’s space budget is
devoted to space science, in support of
astronomy, planetary science and geophysics.
Contributions have been made to missions
ranging from the Hubble Space Telescope to
the Ulysses solar space probe. The UK is
contributing substantially to the SOHO
mission to study the Sun; to the Infrared
Space Observatory, which is investigating the
birth and death of stars; and to the Cassini
Huygens mission, a seven-year programme to
send a probe to Saturn and its moon Titan,
launched in 1997. It is also participating in
XMM, ESA’s 1999 X-ray spectroscopy
mission, which will investigate X-ray
emissions from black holes.
The UK is taking a leading role in the
largest current international project in
ground-based astronomy. The Gemini project
involves building two 8 m telescopes at Mauna
Kea (Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon (Chile): the
former became operational in June 1999 and
the latter is expected to be completed in 2000.
The other partners are the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The UK
has a 25% stake in the work, with major
responsibility for the primary mirror support
system and much of the control software.
The UK has many bilateral agreements for
scientific research with other countries, such
as Russia, Japan and the United States. For
example, British scientists developed the high-
resolution camera for Chandra (the NASA
X-ray satellite).
Another major area of British space
expertise is satellite communications and
In May 1999, the ESA Ministerial Council
adopted the £400 million Living Planet
environmental research programme, to
help scientists understand and predict the
Earth’s environment and humankind’s
effects upon it. For example, it will
measure soil moisture and other factors
that are essential to the accurate modelling
of climate systems. The BNSC will
contribute £67 million to this programme.
The first project to benefit from the
programme will be the British CRYOSAT
mission, to be launched in 2002, which will
study the effects of global warming on the
polar ice caps.
navigation. In Europe, the UK is both a
leading producer and user of satellite
communications technology (see p. 484). It is
taking a leading role in preparations for future
ESA satellite communications missions,
including ARTEMIS, which will provide
important communications links for the
ENVISAT programme. Britain is also
contributing to the development of a global
navigation satellite system within Europe,
which will augment the United States GPS
system to provide increased accuracy and
reliability for civil aviation global navigation.
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has operated a series of
R&D framework programmes, across a range
of disciplines and sectors, to strengthen the
scientific and technological basis of European
industry and support the development of EU
policies. About half of all projects have
included British participation, which has been
particularly strong in biomedicine, agriculture,
transport, and social and economic research.
The Fifth Framework Programme was agreed
in December 1998 and will run for four years
(1999-2002). It will support strategic and
applied multidisciplinary research targeted at
tackling pressing European problems, such as
land transport, marine technology and the ‘city
of tomorrow’.

SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Other International Activities
Over 800 UK organisations have taken part in
EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing advanced products and processes
with worldwide sales potential. There are 27
members of EUREKA, including the 15 EU
countries and the European Commission.
Some 700 projects are in progress, involving
firms, universities and research organisations.
Over 300 projects have finished, and among
the successful ones is E! 147 DAB, where UK
companies have helped pioneer the
development of a digital radio system,
resulting in new products on the market, as
well as an international standard.
The COST programme (European Co¬
operation in the field of Science and Technical
research) encourages co-operation in national
research activities across Europe, with
participants from industry, academia and
research laboratories. Transport,
telecommunications and materials have
traditionally been the largest areas supported.
New areas include physics, chemistry,
neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. There are 32 member states and the
UK takes part in 157 out of 176 current
COST actions.
Another example of international
collaboration is CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics, based in
Geneva, where the proposed Large Hadron
Collider is due to be completed by 2005.
Scientific programmes at CERN aim to test,
verify and develop the ‘standard model’ of the
origins and structure of the universe. There
are 20 member states. The Particle Physics
and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC—
see p. 437) leads UK participation in CERN.
Britain also contributes to the high-flux
neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin
and to the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility, both in Grenoble.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on the
ionosphere. The Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC) has a major
involvement in international programmes of
research into global climate change organised
through the World Climate Research
Programme and the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme. It also supports the
UK’s subscription to the Ocean Drilling
Program.
Through the Medical Research Council
(MRC), the UK participates in the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), at
Heidelberg. The European Bioinformatics
Institute, an outstation of the EMBL, at
Hinxton near Cambridge, provides up-to-date
information on molecular biology and genome
sequencing for researchers throughout
Europe. The MRC pays Britain’s contribution
to the Human Frontier Science Programme,
which supports international collaborative
research into brain function and biological
function through molecular-level approaches.
It also pays Britain’s subscription to the
International Agency for Cancer Research.
The UK is a member of the science and
technology committees of such international
organisations as the OECD and NATO, and
of various specialised agencies of the United
Nations, including UNESCO. The Research
Councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy are members of the European
Science Foundation, and a number of British
scientists are involved in its initiatives.
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration in science,
engineering and technology. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices (see p. 97) conduct
government business on, and promote
contacts in, science, engineering and
technology between the UK and overseas
countries; and help to inform a large number
of organisations in the UK about
developments and initiatives overseas. There
are science and technology sections in British
Missions in Paris, Tokyo, Washington,
Beijing (Peking), Bonn, Moscow, Pretoria,
Seoul, Rome and Ottawa, and a number of
British Council offices have designated
Science Officer posts.
The British Council promotes the
creativity and innovation of cutting-edge UK
science through events, partnership
programmes, seminars, exhibitions and
information provision. It balances one-to-one

scientific links with projects aimed at raising
awareness of scientific issues among overseas
public audiences through popular
communication. The Research Councils and
the British Council maintain a joint office in
Brussels to promote UK participation in
European research programmes.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each Research Council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research,
study and training in universities and other
higher education institutions, and carry out or
support research, through their own institutes
and at international research centres, often
jointly with other public sector bodies and
international organisations. They provide
awards to about 15,000 postgraduate students
in science, social sciences, engineering and
technology. In addition to funding from the
OST, the Councils receive income from
research commissioned by government
departments and the private sector.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
The EPSRC, the Research Council with the
largest budget (£404 million in 1999-2000), has
responsibility to promote and support high-
quality basic, strategic and applied research and
related postgraduate training in engineering
and the physical sciences. It also has
responsibility to provide advice, disseminate
knowledge and promote public understanding
in these areas. Its remit is delivered through
nine programme areas: physics, chemistry,
mathematics, the generic technologies of
information technology and materials, three
engineering programmes (general engineering,
engineering for manufacturing and engineering
for infrastructure, the environment and
healthcare) and the life sciences. This last
programme was set up in 1999 to cover
research and training on the borders of
EPSRC’s responsibilities and the life sciences.
EPSRC ‘Partnerships for Public
Understanding’ awards were launched in 1998
The relentless miniaturisation of electronic
products, from palmtop computers to
portable phones, has resulted in the search
for ways of storing sufficient charge to
power these devices in ever smaller
batteries. Scientists at the University of St
Andrews, with support from EPSRC, have
made an important advance in the science
underpinning rechargeable batteries. By
successfully synthesising a new type of
lithium compound, the researchers have
opened up the prospect of a new
generation of more efficient, smaller
batteries.
to improve public awareness of leading
research and its possible impact on society.
The awards encourage researchers to
communicate the value of their work to the
public. In the first year, 25 projects received
awards totalling £570,000. Electronic help for
the blind, a virtual tour of Whitehall and an
animated character that explains human
movement were three of the topics chosen.
The awards bring together scientists with
industry specialists, schools, artists, poets,
community groups and the media in a wide
range of activities.
Medical Research Council (MRC)
The MRC, with an overall budget of £325
million for 1999-2000, is the main source of
public funds for biomedical and related
sciences research. It supports research and
training aimed at maintaining and improving
human health. The MRC advances
knowledge and technology to meet the needs
of user communities, including the providers
of healthcare and the biotechnology, food,
healthcare, medical instrumentation,
pharmaceutical and other biomedical-related
industries. About half the MRC’s expenditure
is allocated to its own institutes and units, the
rest going mainly on grant support of research
in universities, including training awards.
The Council has two large institutes—the
National Institute for Medical Research at
Mill Hill in London and the Laboratory of
Molecular Biology in Cambridge; it also runs
the Clinical Sciences Centre at the Royal
436
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Postgraduate Medical School. It has more
than 40 research units and a number of
smaller scientific teams.
The first genetic ‘blueprint’ of an animal
was completed by British scientists at the
Sanger Centre on the Wellcome Trust
Genome Campus in Hinxton and funded
by the MRC, in collaboration with
scientists in the United States. Results
were published in December 1998 from a
15-year project to sequence the complete
genome of the nematode worm C. elegans.
Although containing fewer than 1,000 cells
and only about 1 mm in length, C. elegans
is built using remarkably similar principles
to those of humans. The completed gene
sequence gives scientists and health
practitioners worldwide valuable
information to aid the study of the human
body in health as well as in illness and
may, for example, lead to new treatments
for disease.
A team of UK researchers made a major
advance in understanding how the brain
protein involved in bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in
humans causes so much damage. Prion
diseases, such as BSE and scrapie in
animals, and CJD in humans, all involve
conversion of a normal cell protein, known
as the prion protein, into an abnormal or
rogue form. The researchers captured this
mysterious change in a test tube, using a
genetic modification of normal soluble
prion protein. The research provided, for
the first time, an explanation of how these
prions replicate. This has led to the
development, by the same team of
researchers, of new diagnostic tests for
prion disease in humans and animals.
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC)
The NERC is principally concerned with the
themes of sustainable development,
environmental protection (see p. 340), and the
quality of life. In 1999-2000 it will spend
most of its budget of £220 million in the
following areas: biodiversity; environmental
risks and hazards; global change; natural
resource management; and pollution and
waste.
The Council supports research in its own
and other research establishments as well as
research and training in universities. It also
provides a range of facilities for use by the
wider environmental science community,
including a marine research fleet. NERC
establishments include the British Geological
Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the
Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences and
the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
together with a number of university-based
units. 1 he Southampton Oceanography
Centre, a partnership with Southampton
University, undertakes research, training and
support activities in oceanography, geology
and aspects of marine technology and
engineering. The NERC’s Research Vessel
Services are located at the Centre.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
The BBSRC has a budget of £195 million for
1999-2000. It supports basic and strategic
research and research training related to the
understanding and exploitation of biological
systems, which underpin the agriculture,
bioprocessing, chemical, food, healthcare,
pharmaceutical and other biotechnology-
related industries. The scientific themes are
biomolecular sciences; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences; agri-food; and engineering and
biological systems. As well as funding research
in universities and other research centres
throughout the UK, the BBSRC sponsors
eight research institutes.
Particle Physics and Astronomy

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Fundamental research into the nature of
genes, how they work and how they can be
transferred between organisms, has
underpinned the development of the
technology of genetic modification (GM).
As well as driving new applications of
GM, the research is providing basic
information about the behaviour of genes,
and of genetically modified organisms
(GMOs). This information addresses
many concerns about the safety of GMOs
and their impact on the environment. In
May 1999 the Government announced a
new framework for overseeing
developments in biotechnology, including
the establishment of new strategic and
long-term commissions to advise on
human genetics and agricultural and
environmental issues.
fundamental physical processes. Its three main
areas of research are:
• particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
• astronomy (including cosmology and
astrophysics)—the origin, structure and
evolution of the Universe, stars and
galaxies; and
• planetary science (including solar and
terrestrial physics)—the origin and
evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
The PPARC provides research and training
grants to universities, and access to major
facilities including observatories on La Palma
(Canary Islands) and Hawaii. The Council is
responsible for the UK’s contributions to
international collaborations, including ESA
and CERN (see pp. 433 and 435).
competitiveness, quality of life, and the
effectiveness of public services and policy. All
research funded by the ESRC is conducted in
higher education institutions or independent
research establishments. The Council has nine
priority themes: economic performance and
development; environment and sustainability;
globalisation, regions and emerging markets;
governance, regulation and accountability;
technology and people; innovation;
knowledge, communication and learning;
lifespan, lifestyles and health; and social
inclusion and exclusion.
The ESRC is planning a £2.2 million
longitudinal study of people born in the
year 2000—the Millennium Cohort—
which will collect lifetime data on all aspects
of people’s lives, providing a unique insight
into the effects of change over the next half
century and beyond. It will also greatly
enhance the capacity of current longitudinal
studies to chart social change.
The ESRC has recently launched a Centre
for Longitudinal Studies to ensure effective
implementation, co-ordination and analysis of
the Millennium Cohort study and other
longitudinal data. This Centre will
complement three other Centres set up for the
Study of Knowledge, Skills and
Organisational Performance; for the Analysis
of Social Exclusion; and for the Study of
Globalisation and Regionalisation.
A research agenda has been drawn up for
institutional, social and political change in the
regions, which will include developments in
England, the UK as a whole and in the EU. A
series of short-term studies of immediate
institutional changes in Scotland and Wales
are planned along with a major research
programme on Devolution and Constitutional
Change in the UK, for which up to £5 million
will be provided.
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC)
The ESRC, with an R&D provision of about
£70 million for 1999-2000, supports research
and training to enhance the UK’s economic
Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils (CCLRC)
The CCLRC promotes scientific and
engineering research by supplying facilities
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
and technical expertise primarily to meet the
needs of the other Research Councils. Its
R&D budget for 1999-2000 is £112 million, of
which £83 million comes through agreements
with other Research Councils and another £24
million comes from contracts and agreements
with the EU, overseas countries, and other
industries and organisations. It covers a broad
range of science and technology, including
materials, structural and biomolecular science
using accelerators, synchrotrons and lasers,
satellite instrumentation and data processing,
remote-sensing, electronics, sensor
technology, computing, mobile
communications, micro-engineering,
microsystems and particle physics.
The CCLRC is responsible for three
research establishments: the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire; the
Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire; and the
Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire. These
centres provide facilities too large or complex
to be housed by individual academic
institutions. Among the facilities are ISIS (the
world’s leading source of pulsed neutrons and
muons), some of the world’s brightest lasers
and the United Kingdom Synchrotron Light
Source.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of the UK’s long¬
term strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The Higher Education
Funding Councils in England, Scotland and
Wales (see p. 135) provide the main general
funds to support research in universities and
other higher education institutions in Great
Britain. These funds pay for the salaries of
permanent academic staff, who usually teach
as well as undertake research, and contribute
to the infrastructure for research. The quality
of research performance is a key element in
the allocation of funding. In Northern Ireland
institutions are funded by the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions are also financed by the
Research Councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of Research
Council grants have the rights over the
commercial exploitation of their research,
subject to the prior agreement of the
sponsoring Research Council. They may
make use of technology transfer experts and
other specialists to help exploit and license
the results of their research. The other main
channels of support are industry, charities,
government departments and the EU. The
high quality of research in higher education
institutions, and their marketing skills, have
enabled them to attract more funding from a
larger range of external sources, especially in
contract income from industry and charities.
Science Parks
The UK has a range of Science Parks—
property-based initiatives having formal or
operational links to a higher education
institution or other major research centre. The
UK Science Park Association numbers 55
such initiatives, which between them host over
1,400 firms employing about 27,000 people in
total. Many of these firms are spin-offs from
the associated institution or are start-up
enterprises in fields of high-technology such
as software, biotechnology, analytical services
or consultancy.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Research and Technology Organisations
(RTOs)
RTOs are independent organisations carrying
out commercially relevant research and other
services on behalf of industry, often relating
to a specific industrial sector. Others are
contract research organisations undertaking
specific projects for any client. The
Association of Independent Research and
Technology Organisations has some 45
members which together employ about 9,000
people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for biomedical research in the UK.
Their combined contribution in 1998-99 was
439
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
about £440 million. The three largest were
from the Wellcome Trust, the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer
Research Campaign.
Professional and Learned Institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned
societies in the UK, many of which promote
their own disciplines or the education and
professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has ten member institutes
representing biology, biochemistry,
chemistry, environment, food science and
technology, geology, hospital physics and
physics.
The Engineering Council promotes and
regulates the engineering profession. It
represents 120 industry affiliates, which
include large private sector companies and
government departments, and 36 professional
engineering institutions. In partnership with
the institutions, the Council accredits higher
education courses and advises the
Government on academic, industrial and
professional issues. It also runs a number of
promotional activities. Some 286,000
individuals are on the Council’s Register,
through their institution, as either Chartered
or Incorporated Engineers or as Engineering
Technicians.
Royal Society
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is the
UK’s academy of science and has about 1,200
Fellows and 100 Foreign Members. Many of
its Fellows serve on governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with
research. The Society has a dual role, as the
national academy of science and as the
provider of a range of services, including
research fellowships and grants, for the
scientific community. It offers independent
advice to government on science matters, acts
as a forum for discussion of scientific issues,
and fosters public awareness of science and
science education. Its government grant for
1999-2000 is £23.8 million.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
which has 1,125 Fellows and 77 Foreign
Members. It promotes excellence in
engineering for the benefit of society, and
advises government, Parliament and other
official organisations. The Academy’s
programmes are aimed at attracting first-class
students into engineering, raising awareness of
the importance of engineering design among
undergraduates, developing links between
industry and higher education, and increasing
industrial investment in engineering research
in higher education institutions. It has a
government grant of £3.7 million in
1999-2000.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
offering postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It has been engaged with
Scottish Enterprise in developing a strategy to
increase the extent of commercial use of the
products of the Scottish research base (see
p. 433), and has been active in the Foresight
process. It also acts as a source of independent
scientific advice to the Government and
others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
founded in 1831, is mainly concerned with
science, while the Royal Society of Arts,
dating from 1754, deals with the arts and
commerce as well as science. The Royal
Institution, founded in 1799, also performs
these functions and runs its own research
laboratories.

SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
The Royal Institution, which is celebrating
its bicentenary in 1999, began as an
‘Institution For diffusing the Knowledge,
and facilitating the general Introduction, of
Useful Mechanical Inventions and
Improvements; and for teaching, by
Courses of Philosophical Lectures and
Experiments, the application of Science to
the common Purposes of Life’. It acquired
its current premises (at Albemarle Street
in London) in 1799 and a Royal Charter,
granted by King George III, early in 1800.
In the Institution’s laboratory, Humphrey
Davy, Michael Faraday and John Tyndall
carried out their fundamental research.
Fifteen Nobel Laureates, including
William and Lawrence Bragg, have worked
in the Institution’s Davy Faraday Research
Laboratory, which has been the base for an
extraordinary series of scientific
discoveries. Today, nearly 40 scientists are
concentrating on aspects of solid state
chemistry.
In 1826 Faraday started two
programmes to bring the excitement of
science to a wider public: the Christmas
Lectures and the Friday Evening Discourses.
Both programmes continue today, in the
famous Albemarle Street lecture theatre.
1 he Christmas Lectures now reach a
worldwide audience, being broadcast in
Britain, other parts of Europe, Japan and
the United States.
education charity founded in 1826, runs
London Zoo, which occupies about 15
hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park (London).
It also owns and runs Whipsnade Wild Animal
Park (243 hectares/600 acres) in Bedfordshire.
ZSL is responsible for the Institute of
Zoology, which carries out research in support
of conservation. The Institute’s work covers
topics such as ecology, reproductive biology
and conservation genetics. ZSL also operates
in overseas conservation projects, and is
concerned with practical field conservation,
primarily in East and Southern Africa, the
Middle East and parts of Asia. Other well-
known zoos in the UK include those in
Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley and
Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded
in 1759, covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at
Kew in south-west London and a 187-hectare
(462-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place
(Ardingly, in West Sussex). They contain
one of the largest collections of living and
dried plants in the world. Research is
conducted into all aspects of plant life,
including physiology, biochemistry, genetics,
economic botany and the conservation of
habitats and species. During 1998-2000 Kew
is building the Millennium Seed Bank,
containing the world’s most comprehensive
collection of seeds of flowering plants, at
Wakehurst Place (see p. 326). The
Millennium Commission is donating up to
£30 million towards the estimated £80
million cost of the project and the Wellcome
Trust is granting £9 million. Staff are also
active in programmes to reintroduce
endangered plant species to the wild. Kew
participates in joint research programmes in
some 50 countries.
A major new classification for flowering
plants has been developed by an
international team led by scientists at the
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where most
of the work was conducted. The new
classification is based on DNA sequence
analysis of the plants and will supersede
200 years of plant taxonomy built on the
comprehensive work of Linnaeus. It has
caused a complete rethink of the
relationships between plants. It shows, for
example, that the closest relative of the
lotus, the sacred flower of Buddhism, is
not the water lily it so closely resembles
but the plane tree seen in many London
squares and streets.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
was established in 1670, and is the national
botanic garden of Scotland. Together with its
three associated specialist gardens, which were
acquired to provide a range of different
climatic and soil conditions, it has become an
internationally recognised centre for taxonomy
(classification of species); for the conservation
and study of living and preserved plants and

fungi; and as a provider of horticultural
education.
A national botanic garden and research
centre for Wales is to be developed on a 230-
hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall
estate at Llandeilo, near Swansea (see p. xii).
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum is one of
Britain’s most popular visitor attractions, with
exhibitions devoted to the Earth and the life
sciences. It is founded on collections of 68
million specimens from the natural world, has
350 scientists working in 60 countries, and has
500,000 historically important original works
of art. It also offers an advisory service to
institutions all over the world. The Science
Museum promotes the public understanding
of the history of science, technology, industry
and medicine. An ambitious construction
scheme, the new Wellcome Wing, will add
10,000 sq metres of display space to the
Museum from June 2000. This new wing will
contain galleries on biomedical science and
information technology and a 450-seat 3D
IMAX (large format screen) theatre. These
two museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections include
those at the Museum of Science & Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.

The downturn in British agriculture continued in 1998. The value of gross
output fell by 9% (j£1.68 billion) and of gross value added by 11%. Total income
from farming fell for the third year in succession—by 29°/o (32%> in real terms).
The UK has won its 40-month battle to lift the worldwide ban on its beef
exports owing to the BSE crisis, which has cost more than £5 billion in
eradication measures and lost exports. During 1998-99 the Government
announced two aid packages, worth a total of £270 million, to help the livestock
sector. It has also stressed its commitment to sustainable and environmentally
sensitive agriculture.
Agriculture
The slump in world farm prices in 1998,
contrasting with the much higher returns of
the early and mid-1990s, reflects the collapse
of demand for imported foods in south-east
Asia and Russia following periods of economic
crisis, and the consequent oversupply in
commodity markets. The European Union
(EU), after discussing the problem of how to
bring its farm support system closer to market
prices, has agreed cuts of up to 15% in
guaranteed returns for milk and cereals, and
20% for beef. It has also demanded a freeze on
traditional Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) spending at an annual level of 40.5
billion euros (£27 billion), thus cutting the
overall cost of the farm package from 297.7
billion euros (£196 billion) to 296.6 billion
euros (£195 billion) during 2000-06.
In 1998 the British farming industry
employed 2.3% of the total workforce
(615,000 people). Agriculture’s contribution to
GDP fell from £8.22 billion in 1997 to £7.3
billion in 1998, 1% of the total. Food, feed
and beverages accounted for 9% of Britain’s
imports by value and for 5.6% of exports.
Self-sufficiency in food continued to decline
in 1998 as the value of home production fell in
relation to the value of imports and exports:
during 1997-98 self-sufficiency in all food fell
from 69.8% to 68.1% and in indigenous-type
food from 83.1% to 82.3%.’
1 These figures cannot be compared with those for
previous years as improvements in the method of
calculating self-sufficiency were introduced in 1998 to take
account of the higher proportion of processed foods, as
opposed to unprocessed commodities imported in recent
years.

In 1851 farming was still Britain’s largest
industry and employed 1.8 million people.
There were few constraints on trade,
however, and by 1900 the UK had become
the world’s foremost food importer, with
the land under cultivation reduced by over
30% since 1871. On 1 January 1901 The
Times newspaper, quoting a prominent
contemporary figure on an agricultural
tour of England, printed the following
appraisal: ‘The year 1900 would drive the
farmer to utter despair did he not look
forward with faith and hope to better crops
and remunerative prices in the years of the
20th century.’ It added that the great
danger to English farms was the lack of
labour, with many youngsters leaving the
country in search of livelihoods in the
towns. However disastrous to British
farmers, though, increased quantities of
cheap and imported food were considered
of inestimable benefit to England’s
crowded population—some 30 million.
Land Use
In 1998, agricultural land made up 76% of the
UK’s total land area, with 11.66 million
hectares (28.8 million acres) under crops and
grass. A further 5.8 million hectares (14.4
million acres) were used for rough grazing,
most of it in hilly areas. Soils vary from the
thin poor ones of highland Britain to the rich
fertile soils of low-lying areas, such as the
fenlands of eastern England. The climate is
generally temperate, though rainfall
distribution over Britain is uneven (see
p. 3).
Farming
In 1998 there were some 237,900 farm
holdings in the UK (excluding minor holdings
too small to be surveyed on a regular basis).
These main holdings have in 1999 an average
area of 71 hectares (175 acres), again excluding
minor holdings. About 45% of them are
smaller than eight European size units

(ESUs).2 About two-thirds of all agricultural
land is owner-occupied; the rest is tenanted or
rented.
Since 1973 the productivity of UK
agriculture has increased by over 40%,
largely as a result of declining labour input.
Total income from farming (representing
income to those with an entrepreneurial
interest in the agricultural industry—see
Table 27.2) was estimated at £2.2 billion in
1998, 29% lower (at current prices) than in
1997, or 32% less in real terms. In 1998 the
net value added of UK agriculture (which
measures the income generated from
production to all those employed in the
industry) was 14% lower than in 1997—the
prices for most agricultural commodities
having fallen sharply in 1998. For example,
between September 1996 and September
1998 the prices producers received fell by
17% for cattle, by 37% for sheep, by 33% for
eggs, and by 57% for pigmeat. The main
reasons were oversupply of commodity

markets, economic difficulties in Russia and
Asia, and the strength of sterling. A similar
indicator, calculated on a slightly different
basis, showed a fall of 16% in the UK, but of
4% in the EU as a whole.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 27.3 as a percentage by weight
of total supplies. Total new supply is home
production plus imports less exports.
Livestock
About hall of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. Most of the animals are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and northern and south¬
western England. Among world-famous
British livestock are the Hereford and
Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey,
Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large
White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Livestock totals are given in Table 27.4.

Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 42% of the
value of Britain’s gross agricultural output.
Dairy production is the largest part of the
sector, followed by cattle and calves, and then
sheep and lambs. Most dairy cattle in the UK
are bred by artificial insemination. In 1998 the
average size of dairy herds was 66 (excluding
minor holdings), while the average yield of
milk for each dairy cow was 5,793 litres (1,274
gallons).
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed
predominates. The remainder derives from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, mostly in the hills and uplands. The
traditional British beef breeds, (see p. 445)
and, increasingly, imported breeds, such as
Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian
Blue, are used for beef production. The size of
the beef-breeding herd expanded by 36%
during 1988—98, while the dairy herd
decreased by 17%.
The value of beef and veal production
fell by 14% in 1998 to £1,943 million,
because of lower cattle prices and a fall in
compensation payments after the BSE crisis
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy—see
p. 451). Domestic use of beef and veal went
up by 1%.
The UK has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. The size
of the British breeding flock rose by nearly
3% in 1998, and production of sheepmeat by
nearly 9%, although the value of production
fell by 5% to £1,142 million. A wet summer,
which delayed the fattening of lambs for
slaughter, and the collapse of the Russian
market for skins contributed to the sharp fall
in lamb prices, with lowland lamb producers
losing between £10 and £15 a lamb. Hill
farmers in Scotland and Wales have been
particularly badly affected.
Pigs
Pig production is especially important in East
Anglia, Yorkshire and north-east Scotland.
Over 20% of holdings with breeding sows
account for 84% of the national breeding
herd, which comprises some 705,000 sows.
The value of pigmeat production in 1998 was
£873 million, 27% down on 1997, because
increases in the breeding herd led to a larger
number to sell in 1998, when prices collapsed
owing to cheap imports. In late September
1998 average producer prices were the lowest
447
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
for 20 years, with pig rearers estimated to be
losing at least £20 for each pig sold.
Poultry
The total UK bird population in 1998
consisted of 98 million chickens and other
table fowls; 29.5 million birds in the laying
flock; 10 million fowls for breeding; and 15
million turkeys, ducks and geese.
Poultry production in 1998 was 1.53
million tonnes, a 2% increase on 1997, but
prices continued to decrease, partly because of
lower feed prices, but also because of
oversupply and low-price imports. The value
of hen eggs for human consumption was 8%
down.
Farm Animal Welfare
The UK has taken the lead in pressing for
improved welfare standards throughout the
EU. The Welfare of Animals (Staging Points)
Order 1998 lays down standards for the
construction and operation of staging points
from 1 January 1999. New EU standards for
vehicles carrying animals for over 8 hours
were implemented in the Welfare of Animals
(Transport) (Amendment) Order 1999, which
came into effect on 1 July 1999.
The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order
1997 is being reviewed. On 31 May 1999 new
arrangements for pre-export inspections of
food animals destined for other EU member
states were introduced, to ensure that all
animals are healthy and fit to travel. Certifying

veterinarians are provided with clearer and
more transparent instructions, including
minimum inspection times. The State
Veterinary Service assessed compliance with
current legislation at livestock markets and the
Government began a review of the Welfare of
Animals (Markets) Order 1990. In June 1999
the EU voted to ban the use of the barren
battery cage from 2012, to introduce improved
standards in the interim and, for the first time,
to set minimum welfare standards for non¬
cage systems.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 27.5. In the
UK in 1998, the area planted to cereals
totalled 3.42 million hectares (8.45 million
acres), a decrease of 3% on 1997, despite the
set-aside rate remaining at 5% (see below).
This was owing to a shift towards more
economically advantageous oilseeds.
Production was down by 740,000 tonnes (3%).
Over 1998 the value of production was 14%
lower than in 1997 and the price of cereals fell
by a further ^10to£15a tonne on already low
1997 prices. Despite small increases in area,
yield and output, even the value of wheat
production, at £1,647 million, was 11% lower
than in 1997.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation
takes place on the fertile soils throughout the
UK, often with irrigation. Principal areas are
the peat and silt fens of Cambridgeshire,
Lincolnshire and Norfolk; the sandy loams of
Norfolk, Suffolk, West Midlands,
Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire; the peat soils of south
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts by the river
Humber. Early potatoes are produced in
Shropshire, Pembrokeshire (Wales),
Cornwall, Devon, Essex, Suffolk, Kent,
Cheshire and south-west Scotland.
Production of high-grade seed potatoes is
confined mainly to Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the northern uplands and the Welsh
borders. Although prolonged rainy weather in
1998 caused delays for both planting and
lifting, with yields down by 8%, the total
value of potato production increased by 67%
(£257 million) on 1997.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides
just over half of home needs, most of the
remainder being refined from raw cane sugar
imported under the sugar protocol to the
Lome Convention (see pp. 420-1).
Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS)
The AAPS, of which set-aside is a part and
which originally aimed to cut cereals support
prices, helps compensate farmers for these
cuts. I hey are paid for the land under arable
production, not the quantity of crop. To
qualify for subsidy, all but the smallest
farmers must set aside a proportion of their
land (10% for the 1999 harvest) to reduce
cereals production. Where land is eligible, the
subsidy is paid on cereals, oilseeds, proteins
(including peas for harvesting dry) and
linseed.
Set-aside pay ments compensate farmers for
leaving part of their land fallow, while keeping
it in good agricultural condition. They are
encouraged to maximise the environmental
benefit of the scheme and are allowed to count
land entered into various environmental
schemes (see p. 455) against their set-aside
obligation. In addition to the compulsory set-
aside rate (10% in 1999) growers may set
aside, on a voluntary basis, more than 50% of
the area claimed under the AAPS provided all
of the set-aside land is used for the production
of multiannual crops, such as short-rotation
coppice, for biomass production. Farmers may
also get grants of up to 50% of the costs
associated with the establishment of such
crops on set-aside land.
In 1998, 61,263 AAPS claims for 4.6
million hectares (11.3 million acres) were
received in the UK; nearly £1,180 million was
paid out.
Horticulture
In 1998 the land used for horticulture
(excluding hops, potatoes, and peas for
harvesting dry) was 176,797 hectares (436,883
acres), compared with 184,000 hectares in
1997. Vegetables grown in the open accounted
449
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
for 69.5% of this, orchards for 16%, soft fruit
for 5.6%, ornamentals (including hardy
nursery stock, bulbs and flowers grown in the
open) for 8% and glasshouse crops for 1%.
More than one vegetable crop may be taken
from the same area of land in a year, so that
the estimated area actually cropped for
horticulture in 1998 was 213,500 hectares
(527,580 acres).
The output value of horticultural products
(including seeds and peas harvested dry) was
£1,752 million. Some £3,859 million of fruit
and vegetables was imported.
Under the reformed EU fruit and
vegetables regime, EU grants (up to 50% of
eligible expenditure) are payable to producer
organisations (POs) which aim to improve
cultivation techniques, with emphasis on
environmentally sound practices, quality
improvements and marketing. Of 92 POs
recognised in the UK, 76 have programmes
running in 1999, with a total value of about
£31 million.
Agri-Industrial Materials
The Agri-Materials Branch (formerly
Alternative Crops Unit) of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
seeks to encourage the marketing of renewable
energy raw materials from crops. It funds
about £1.1 million of R&D each year. It has
promoted short-rotation coppice as an energy
crop; miscanthus as a crop for energy and
industry; hemp and flax for fibre; and herbs
for oil.
Genetically Modified Crops
The first trials of genetically modified (GM)
crops in the UK were completed in the late
1980s. These and subsequent trials have been
small-scale releases into the environment.
Before general cultivation is allowed to take
place, a managed programme of farm-scale
trials of three herbicide-tolerant crops began
in 1999. This programme will continue for
four years so that their effect on wildlife can
be assessed. The sites are to be closely and
independently monitored; the contracts,
worth £3.3 million, have been awarded to
research organisations. In October 1998 the
Government came to an understanding with
the plant-breeding industry that there would
be no commercial planting of insect-resistant
GM crops for three years and none of
herbicide-tolerant GM crops for at least one
year in the first instance, and then only if it
were satisfied that they would be unlikely to
pose a risk either to human health or to the
environment. It has also stated that should the
trials show a threat to the environment,
commercial planting would not be allowed.
An EU-wide regulatory framework,
designed to protect human health and the
environment, covers all stages of work with
GM organisms (GMOs). All GMOs (which
include GM crops) are subject to safety
evaluation before a consent for release into the
environment is agreed. In the UK, the
Advisory Committee on Releases into the
Environment (ACRE) considers applications
to release and market GMOs. The UK
regulations implement the EC Directive
which covers the deliberate release of GMOs
into the environment for research and
marketing purposes. Consent applications for
the sale of GMOs throughout Europe are
considered by all EU member states before a
consent is issued.
Whether GM crops pose a danger to
human health and the environment has been
the subject of wide debate in the UK. ACRE
has published details of breaches of consents,
most of which concern failures by companies
to stick to procedures designed to prevent GM
crops straying outside their plots or
hybridising with neighbouring plants. Some
companies have been forced to end trials.
Before GM foods are approved for sale in
the EU they must be assessed for safety in
accordance with the EC Novel Foods
Regulation of 1997, which established an EU-
wide pre-market approval system for all novel
foods—those which have not been used for
human consumption in the EU before,
including those containing or produced from
GMOs. The regulation prescribes specific
labelling when an item is judged not to be
equivalent to an existing food. Food will also
need labelling if there are any health or ethical
concerns or if it contains a GMO. In the UK,
assessment of novel foods is carried out by the
450
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
independent Advisory Committee on Novel
Foods and Processes. In 1998 the EU agreed
on rules for labelling Monsanto’s GM soya
and Ciba Geigy’s GM maize, approved before
the Novel Foods Regulation came into force.
An EC Regulation of September 1998 requires
all foods containing GM soya or maize to be
labelled except when neither protein nor DNA
resulting from the modification is present. It
also provides for the formulation of a list of
ingredients which member states agree do not
contain novel protein or DNA. In March 1999
the UK was the first member state to enforce
the Regulation, so that all food businesses,
including restaurants, cafes, bakers and
delicatessens, must (from September 1999)
make clear to customers whether they are
selling foods containing GM ingredients.
Outlets selling foods containing GM material
that is not properly labelled may be
prosecuted and fined up to £5,000.
Since 1992 the Government has spent £3.2
million on research to underpin the safety
assessment of GM foods. It is also committed
to the adequate labelling of GM animal feed
throughout the EU, although there is as yet no
evidence of carry-over of genetic material
from animal feed to the food chain.
Several European supermarket chains have
formed a consortium to eliminate GM
crops and derivatives from their own-label
lood products. J. Sainsbury, one of the
UK’s largest supermarket groups, has led
the initiative, which also includes Marks &
Spencer and members from France,
Belgium, Switzerland, the Irish Republic
and Italy.
An EC Directive of June 1998 on the legal
protection of biotechnological inventions aims
to clarify and harmonise those aspects of
national EU patent laws which concern
genetic materials, plants and animals, and to
balance the needs of the food industry to gain
patents to foster research and the ethical
concerns which surround biotechnology. The
Directive affirms the possibility of patenting
GM plants and animals; but if modification is
likely to cause suffering to the animal, no
patent should be granted, unless it can be
shown that there is substantial medical benefit
to humans or the animal.
FOOD SAFETY
In June 1999 the Government introduced
legislation for a Food Standards Agency
(FSA), as a non-ministerial government
department with powers to protect food safety
and standards throughout the food chain, and
with its own research budget. The aim is to
launch the FSA in the first half of 2000. EU
food law harmonisation covers food safety, fair
trading and informative labelling. For
example, the Beef Labelling Scheme provides
information on fresh and frozen beef
(including mince) which may be confirmed
through improved traceability systems.
BSE
The government announcement in March
1996 of a possible link between BSE in cattle
and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) in humans3 led to an immediate EU
worldwide ban on exports from the UK of all
live bovine animals, beef and beef products,
bovine embryos, and mammalian meat and
bonemeal (MBM). Reopening of the export
market has been of paramount importance for
the future of the beef industry and, following
the Florence agreement of June 1996, various
steps were taken to achieve this, including:
• a selective slaughter programme, to
accelerate eradication of BSE from the
national herd;
• introduction of an effective animal
identification and movement recording
system;
• legislation for removal of all mammalian
MBM from farms and feedmills;
• strengthening and tightening controls on
slaughterhouses to ensure removal of
specified risk materials (SRM); and
3 By the end of February 1999 some 40 people had died
from nvCJD in the UK. BSE has been detected in more
than 175,000 cattle across Europe, 99.7% of them in the
UK.
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• effective implementation of the Over
Thirty Months Scheme to remove meat
from older bovine animals from the food
chain and destroy it.
In 1997 a risk from beef bones to
consumers was identified and their use in food
manufacture, and the retail sale of bone-in
beef, were banned. Since June 1998 the
Export Certified Herds Scheme has enabled
the export from Northern Ireland of deboned
beef and its products from animals qualifying
under the Scheme. From 1 August 1999
export from the UK of deboned beef
produced under the Date-based Export
Scheme (DBES), which lays down criteria for
beef to be eligible for export, has been
permitted. A DBES precondition was that the
UK must slaughter all offspring born to
confirmed BSE cases between 1 August 1996
and 25 November 1998, a process completed
by June 1999. The UK is further required to
slaughter offspring of BSE cases confirmed
since 25 November 1998 without delay.
Application of the EU Decision of 1997
prohibiting the use of SRMs from cattle,
sheep and goats over 12 months has been
postponed until 31 December 1999 because of
the unforeseen impact of the legislation on the
supply of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, and
the failure of subsequent Commission
proposals to achieve qualified majority
support from member states. In the absence of
Community rules, the UK introduced national
controls prohibiting the import of SRMs
except when delivered to approved premises
for manufacture of technical products, such as
bone china. Imports of certain animal
products for food or animal feed must be
accompanied by additional veterinary
certification confirming that they do not
contain any SRMs.
The decline in the number of BSE cases in
Britain continues. By mid-1999 about 55 cases
were being reported each week, compared
with over 1,000 a week at the height of the
epidemic in 1993.
Tighter hygiene rules on the production
and marketing of fresh meat, designed to
help restore public confidence in food safety,
were announced in March 1999. These
implemented EU rules updated to allow
hygiene controls to adapt to modern
production methods and to make it possible
to trace meat products back to the point of
production for public health control. The
Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) and its 1,700
veterinary surgeons and inspectors are
responsible for enforcing legislation on meat
hygiene, inspection, animal welfare at
slaughter and SRM controls in all licensed
abattoirs and cutting premises in Great
Britain. The MHS Hygiene Assessment
System score is a published guide to the
hygiene performance of plants measured
over a period. Irrespective of a plant’s score,
however, before any meat produced there
enters the food chain, it must be inspected
and health-marked as fit for human
consumption. In addition, businesses
making, selling or using animal feed
additives have to apply for official approval
or registration.
The Animal By-Products Order 1999
consolidates the rules on the processing and
disposal of animal by-products and the
processing of catering waste for feeding to pigs
or poultry. It also introduces construction and
hygiene standards for knackers’ yards in line
with EU rules.
EXPORTS
Food, feed and drink exports in 1998 were
provisionally valued at £9.2 billion, 7% less
than in 1997 (compared with £17.2 billion for
imports, a fall of 3%). The main EU markets
in 1998 were France (£1.2 billion), the Irish
Republic (£1.1 billion), Spain (£728 million)
and Germany (£700 million). There was a
20% increase in exports to Italy, worth some
£416 million in 1998. Other key markets were
the United States (£724 million) and Japan
(£241 million).
Drink exports showed a decrease of 13% to
£2.9 billion in 1998, largely as a result of a fall
in demand in Far East countries. Cereals
(including cereal products) were the largest
category of British food exports, worth £1.3
billion in 1998. Only sugars and fish showed
an increase on 1997. Meat exports fell by
21%, to £763 million, primarily as a result of
lower prices.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food from Britain (FFB), an
452
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
organisation funded by MAFF on behalf of
the four agricultural departments (£5.3
million in 1998-99) and industry (£7.2
million), which provides a range of business
development services for food and drink
companies seeking expansion in international
markets and within the UK speciality food
and drink sector. It co-ordinates the British
presence at ten or more international food and
drink exhibitions each year and organises
seminars to highlight the benefits of successful
exporting to particular markets and the annual
FFB Export Awards. For all other agricultural
products, services, livestock, machinery and
processing equipment, MAFF co-ordinates
export promotion, participates in overseas
trade fairs and arranges ministerial trade
missions to other countries. During 1999
MAFF attended ten trade events overseas,
providing a platform for UK companies and
attracting export business. Exports of
agricultural machinery and tractors in 1998
were worth £1,419 million.
In 1999 MAFF unveiled a promotional
British cheese map, featuring 60 different
cheeses from more than 400 produced in
the UK. British cheese production has
increased by 18% since 1991, to 366,000
tonnes in 1998. The total volume of
exports in 1998 was 55,063 tonnes,
compared with 52,987 tonnes in 1997.
During 1998 MAFF also highlighted the
opening of Wendy’s Baltic Bread
Wholesale Bakery in St Petersburg, to
produce bread, cakes and pastries to
traditional British recipes. It also praised
Crantock Bakery, which supplies 4 million
Cornish pasties a year; and Rodda’s
Creamery, makers of traditional Cornish
cream, whose export markets include
Hong Kong and Japan. FFB has helped
introduce more than 600 products to Japan
in the past three years and the Feast of
Britain exhibition at Tokyo in November
1998 displayed not only popular British
exports such as Scotch whisky, tea, jam
and biscuits, but also chocolate, cereals and
ready-made foods.
The annual Royal Agricultural Show, held
at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire in early July,
enables visitors to see the latest techniques and
improvements in British agriculture. Some
172,000 visitors attended in 1999, of whom
10% were from overseas. Other major
agricultural events include the Royal
Smithfield Show, held every other year in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcases; the Royal
Highland Show (June; 160,000 visitors in
1999) in Edinburgh, the largest trade
exhibition of agricultural machinery in Great
Britain; the Royal Welsh Show (late July) in
Builth Wells; and the Royal Ulster
Agricultural Show (May) in Belfast.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
MAFF; the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs
Department (SERAD); the National Assembly
for Wales; and the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland have joint responsibility
for agriculture and fisheries matters; in 1999
agriculture was devolved to the Scottish
Parliament and the National Assembly for
Wales. Subject to the outcome of a formal
Implementation Review of the Good Friday
Agreement in Northern Ireland, agriculture
will be devolved to the new Northern Ireland
Assembly (see p. 18). Concordats between
MAFF and the new administrations cover
arrangements after devolution. The work of
MAFF’s nine Regional Service Centres in
England and SERAD’s eight areas in Scotland
relates to payments under domestic and EU
schemes, licensing and other services for
farmers and growers.
Reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP)
The CAP was originally established in the
Treaty of Rome (1957) at a time when high
agricultural productivity was considered
essential to ensure secure, plentiful and cheap
food supplies. Its mechanisms of support
prices, import duties and market intervention,
however, are now held instead to have
distorted incentives for farmers, raised food
prices and encouraged surplus production.

The reforms of 1992 have helped to cut food
mountains to manageable levels and restrained
expansion of the CAP budget, at times over
70% of the EU budget. Further reforms, as
part of the EU’s Agenda 2000 and agreed in
March 1999, represent an acceleration of the
1992 changes, with a further shift in
encouraging agriculture to be more market-
orientated and competitive.
• cereal support prices will fall by 15%,
half in 2000-01, and half in 2001-02;
• the basic price of beef will fall by 20% in
three steps, and the intervention price4
by 25% from 2,780 to 1,560 euros a
tonne;
• dairy support prices will fall by 15% in
three steps, beginning in 2005, and
quotas for milk production will increase
by 1.5% over three years from 2005, with
extra increases for the UK (for Northern
Ireland only), the Irish Republic, Spain,
Italy and Greece;
4 The price at which intervention authorities in member
states buy commodities when their prices fall below certain
agreed levels and store them for later resale.
• direct payments to farmers are being
increased to help compensate them for
the price cuts and, at the UK’s urging, a
Commission proposal to impose a
mandatory EU-wide ceiling on large
farms was withdrawn; and
• the creation of an integrated rural
development policy, including agri¬
environment measures, provides a
framework for a shift in emphasis from
production support to environmental and
rural economy measures, and allows less-
favoured area (LFA) compensation to be
replaced by area payments with a more
environmental focus.
The compromise agreement reached at the
Berlin summit between member states in
March 1999 did not provide for direct
payments to farmers to be made degressive (a
gradual reduction in value over time), which
the UK has advocated as a means to bring
down the cost of the CAP. The cuts in price
support, however, do aim to bring market
forces to bear on EU agriculture and make
farmers more responsive to consumer wishes.
Reductions in cereals support prices will set
the normal rate of compulsory set-aside at
10% during 2000-06. The cut of 20% for
beef, though significant, is not, in the UK’s
view, enough to bring EU beef prices to world
levels, although at the new level the EU will
provide private storage facilities, while not
guaranteeing to buy in meat as in the existing
intervention arrangements.
Under a system of‘national envelopes’, a
small part of the increase in direct payments to
farmers will be given to member states to
distribute according to national criteria suiting
farmers’ needs.
Agrimoney
Since 1 January 1999 CAP payments, hitherto
set in ECUs, have been paid in euros or its
sub-denominations (participating currencies)
in the 11 member states which have adopted
the European single currency. The new
agrimonetary regime has therefore abandoned
the ‘green rate’ and uses daily market rates to
convert CAP payments into national
currencies in the four non-participating
454
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
countries: the UK, Denmark, Greece and
Sweden. There is provision for payment
under CAP schemes to be made in euros to
these four countries, and the Government
plans to make such an option available in the
UK from autumn 2000 on market support
measures, such as export refunds and
intervention buying, with the possibility of
extending this choice to direct farm payments.
Ending the freeze on green rates, which
benefited UK farmers more than any others,
will be subject to a three-year transition
period, during which compensation (in 1999
compulsory and 100% EU-funded) will be
paid.
Special Aid to Farmers
In 1998-99 the Government announced extra
aid of £270 million to UK farmers to help
them through an especially difficult period:
• an extra £48.3 million of agrimonetary
compensation to suckler cow producers;
• a £60 million increase for each of the
years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 in Hill
Livestock Compensatory Allowances
(HLCAs—see p. 457), allowing average
increases in payments of 55%; and
• an extension of the Calf Processing Aid
Scheme (part of the BSE slaughter
programme, originally due to lapse in
November 1998) at about 70% of the
current rate—or about £55 a head.
This aid is in addition to other recent
government steps, including £85 million of
agrimonetary aid for suckler cow and sheep
producers in 1998 and a private storage aid
scheme for pigmeat in the face of a 50% fall in
the producer price of pigs, worth more than
£150 million to the agricultural industry.
Agri-Environment Schemes
The UK’s agri-environment programme
provides schemes to encourage
environmentally beneficial farming and public
enjoyment of the countryside. All are
voluntary and offer payments to farmers who
agree to manage their land for the positive
benefit of wildlife, landscape, resource
protection, historic features or public access.
The payments are based on the agricultural
income which farmers forgo by participating
in the schemes and are partly funded by the
EU. The Government normally evaluates and
reviews these schemes every five years. The
1998-99 payments (provisional) made to
farmers on agri-environment schemes in the
UK were about £97 million. An additional
£40 million is to be made available for the
major schemes in England over three years
from 1999.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
By the end of 1998 over 18,000 farmers
throughout the UK had signed ESA
management agreements to promote
environmentally beneficial farming. Payments
covering these agreements and conservation
plans totalled some £57.8 million in 1998-99.
Sums range between £8 and £500 a hectare,
and are designed to compensate for reduced
profitability as a result of adopting less
intensive production methods. They are
generally funded half by the Government and
half by the European Agricultural Guidance
and Guarantee Fund. In addition to the
revised schemes for 11 of the English ESAs,
designed to conform with the UK’s
Biodiversity Action Plan and relaunched in
1998, six further schemes in England,
reviewed in 1998, were relaunched in 1999.
Countryside Stewardship
Countryside Stewardship is the main
government incentive scheme for farmers in
England for the wider English countryside
outside the ESAs. Payments on over 8,600
agreements covering 143,842 hectares (355,434
acres) in operation at 31 March 1999 are
expected to total some £26.5 million in the
1999-2000 financial year. Taking effect from
August 1998, 78 agreements in the Arable
Stewardship pilot scheme aim to reverse the
decline in a number of wildlife species in East
Anglia and the West Midlands, with £0.5
million set aside for new agreements in each of
the three years of the scheme. Two more
experiments, aiming to test an integrated

Organic Aid
During 1992-97 sales of organic food in the
UK increased by about 250%, and in 1998
were valued at £400 million, but 70% is
imported. The area of UK farmland
organically managed rose from 54,834 hectares
(0.3% of the agricultural area) in April 1998 to
274,519 hectares (1.6%) in April 1999—
compared with an EU average of 1.7%. The
Organic Farming Scheme in England and
Northern Ireland, launched in 1999, raised the
payment rates to those farmers wishing to
convert to organic methods from £250 to
£450 a hectare over five years for most arable
land and temporary grass, and from £50 to
£350 for most improved land in the uplands.
It also removed the current ceiling of 300
hectares on the area of land that can receive
payments on any one organic unit.
The Government also funds the Organic
Conversion Information Service, which provides
Helpline (0117 922 7707) information and
advisory visits to prospective organic farmers in
England and Wales. The UK Register of
Organic Food Standards is charged with
overseeing standards of organic food production.
Other Schemes
The final round of the Nitrate Sensitive Areas
(NSA) Scheme in England (to run until
September 2003) attracted applications
covering 3,000 hectares (7,413 acres) and
brought the total area of land subject to NSA
undertakings to 28,000 hectares (69,190 acres),
with payments of £6.2 million forecast in
1999-2000. Under the UK Habitat Schemes
1,534 farmers entered 16,210 hectares (40,055
acres) into agreements. Proposals have been
made to incorporate the English Habitat
Scheme into the Countryside Stewardship
Scheme from 1 January 2000. The Welsh,
Scottish and Northern Ireland schemes have
been closed to new applicants.
In Scotland there are three agri¬
environment schemes: the ESAs, the Organic
Aid Scheme (OAS) and the Countryside
Premium Scheme, with provision for £18.8
million expenditure in 1999—2000. Wales has
the ESAs, the OAS and Tir Gofal, with
provision for £12.4 million of expenditure
over 1999-2002. Northern Ireland has the
ESAs, the OAS and the Countryside
Management Scheme.
The UK-wide Farm Woodland Premium
Scheme encourages farmers to convert
agricultural land to woodland by providing
annual payments for ten or 15 years to
compensate for income forgone. Payments are
50% funded by the European Commission
under the CAP (75% in disadvantaged areas).
From April 1992 to March 1999 nearly 9,000
applications were approved to convert over
60,000 hectares (148,258 acres). Nearly 75%
of planting is broadleaved trees.
The Rural Economy and EU Structural
Funds
Northern Ireland, the Highlands and Islands
of Scotland and Merseyside qualified for
assistance under Objective 1 of the EU
Structural Funds for the period 1994-99.
456
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
This aims to help those regions whose
economic development lags behind the EU
average. For the period 2000-06, four areas
have been designated for Objective 1 support—
Merseyside, Cornwall, South Yorkshire and
West Wales and Valleys (see p. 395).
Eleven areas in Great Britain (including
South West England, the English Northern
Uplands, 70% of the landmass of Wales, and
Borders, Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland)
were eligible to receive funds under Objective
5b of the EU Structural Funds for the period
1994-99. This aims to promote the economic
development of rural areas. To be eligible,
areas must have a high share of agricultural
employment in total employment, a low level
of agricultural income and a low population
density. In England by the end of June 1999,
345 Objective 5b projects had been approved
and over £101 million in EU and national
public funding had been allocated to them.
This included £4.83 million, comprising EU
and MAFF and other public and private
sector funding, to go towards the Bowland and
Bodmin Moor upland pilot projects (see p.
456). In Scotland by the end of 1998, 228
projects had been approved and over £4.3
million committed. For the period 2000-06
the designation of rural areas will fall under
the new Objective 2 programme.
Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS)
The IACS, an EU-wide anti-fraud measure,
requires farmers claiming payment under
area-based CAP schemes to submit an annual
application for aid giving field-by-field details
of their farmed land. This provides the basis
for administrative and on-farm checks on their
entitlement to aid and for cross-checks
between claims under the agri-environment
and IACS schemes. Administrative checks
involve the use of a computerised database,
and on-the-spot checks are carried out
through farm visits by field officers and the
use of observation satellites.
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances
In Less Favoured Areas (LFAs), generally
hills and uplands, farmers have traditionally
received headage payments on breeding cattle
and sheep to support the continuation of
livestock farming, thus conserving the
countryside and encouraging people to remain
in the LFAs. Under the EU Agenda 2000
reforms, this support must switch from
headage to area payments which are
conditional on the use of sustainable farming
practices. Details of the new area-based
scheme have yet to be finalised.
Agricultural Trade Liberalisation
The next round of negotiations on agricultural
trade liberalisation under the World Trade
Organisation (WTO—see p. 419) is due to start
in January 2000. These are likely to consider
further commitments to improve access for
agricultural products, cuts in subsidised exports
and reductions in domestic support.
In April 1999 the WTO upheld a complaint
by Ecuador, the world’s largest banana exporter,
that the EU banana regime, despite changes in
January 1999, was still incompatible with world
trade rules. At the same time the WTO ruled
that the damage suffered by United States
companies because of the discriminatory
elements of the EU regime amounted to almost
SI20 million a year; the United States
subsequently imposed retaliatory duties to this
value against selected EU exports. EU member
states have asked the Commission, after
consultation with all interested parties, including
the United States, Latin American and African,
Caribbean and Pacific suppliers, to draft
legislation for reform of the EU banana regime.
In July 1999 the United States and Canada
announced retaliatory measures against the EU
over its import ban on meat from animals
treated with hormone growth promoters, which
in 1998 the WTO had found inconsistent with
its rules because it did not follow from a
properly conducted risk assessment. The UK,
which has consistently voted against the ban on
the grounds that it is not scientifically justified,
continues to work for a resolution of the
dispute which is based on sound science.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in the UK in 1998-99 under the
CAP was £3,293 million, compared with
457
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
£3,321 million in 1997-98; expenditure by the
agriculture and other departments (including
funding for special areas) on conservation
measures was £262 million, slightly less than
in 1997-98. The net decrease occurred mainly
because fewer animals entered schemes
introduced to support the industry during the
initial stages of the BSE crisis.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
to farm on their own account. Councils may
lend working capital to them. At 31 March
1997 there were approximately 4,500
smallholdings in England and 787 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Government, which still owns and
maintains 105,000 hectares (259,455 acres) of
land settlement estates, comprising 1,400
crofts and holdings.
In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland,
much of the land is tenanted by crofters, who
enjoy the statutory protection provided by
crofting legislation and can benefit from
government agriculture and livestock
improvement schemes. Most crofters are part-
time agriculturalists, using croft income to
supplement income from other activities. The
Crofters Commission has a statutory duty to
promote their interests and to keep all crofting
matters under review. The Transfer of
Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act 1997 allows
the Government to move some of its own
crofting land to trusts set up by resident
crofters, with the aim of giving them more
responsibility for their own affairs.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About 34% of agricultural land in England
and 22% in Wales is rented. The Agricultural
Tenancies Act 1995 provides a simplified legal
framework for new tenancies entered into on
or after 1 September 1995, known as farm
business tenancies, on which landowners
benefit from full income tax relief.
There is a similar proportion of rented land
in Scotland, much of it under crofting tenure,
including common grazings.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows
owners not wishing to farm all their land to let
it annually to others. Conacre land, about one-
fifth of agricultural land, is used mainly for
grazing.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales the Farming and Rural
Conservancy Agency provides services to
government on the design, development and
implementation of policies on the integration
of farming and conservation, environmental
protection, rural land use and the
diversification of the rural economy. In
England and Wales ADAS provides
professional, business, scientific and technical
services in the agriculture, food and drink, and
environmental markets. In 1997—98 MAFF
wholly or partly funded over 3,600 initial
visits made to farmers by ADAS and the
Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group
(FWAG). In Scotland the Scottish
Agricultural College (SAC) provides
professional, business, scientific and technical
services in the agriculture, rural business, food
and drink, and environmental markets. In
1997-98, 450 visits were made by staff of the
Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland to farmers in the Province. CAIS, a
free and integrated service for Wales, made
5,820 advisory visits in 1995-98.
Lantra is the UK National Training
Organisation for the land-based sector. It
represents about 1.5 million individuals and
400,000 businesses, mostly in rural areas. It
aims to increase competitiveness and develop
the skills and enterprise of those who work in,
or provide specialist services to, the sector. It
receives government support under contracts
to MAFF and the Scottish Executive.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks
on all individual consignments originating
from outside the EU and frequent checks on
458
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
those from other EU member states at
destination points. Measures can be taken to
prevent the import of diseased animals and
genetic material from regions or countries
affected by disease. Veterinary checks also
include unannounced periods of surveillance
at ports.
The campaign to eradicate BSE is
described on p. 451-2. As a further
precaution, the British Cattle Movement
Service (BCMS) for Great Britain, at
Workington, has provided about 2.5 million
cattle with ‘passports’ since its launch in 1998.
It has also processed 2 million passports of
slaughtered cattle and entered 1.75 million
cattle movements on to the Cattle Tracing
System (CTS). The Government has met all
BCMS and CTS start-up and first-year
running costs, a benefit of about £35 million
to the farming industry, and will provide a
further £45 million to fund the CTS until
2002-03.
Traditional measures aimed at preventing
the spread of TB in cattle, such as regular
testing, culling and restricting movements into
and out of affected herds, have not been able
to check a marked increase in the incidence of
the disease in recent years. The Government
is therefore spending over £11 million each
year over 1999-2002 on research and other
work for a better understanding of what causes
the disease and how it is transmitted; on
developing a cattle vaccine; and on
investigating the contribution that badger
culling can make to its effective control.
Professional advice and action on the
statutory control of animal disease and the
welfare of farm livestock are the responsibility
of the State Veterinary Service. It is supported
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(VLA), which also offers its services to the
private sector on a commercial basis. A similar
service is provided in Scotland by the SAC
and in Northern Ireland by the Department of
Agriculture’s Veterinary Sciences Division.
Rabies
Following the recommendations of the
Advisory Group on Quarantine in 1998, the
Government intends to change the law to
allow most pet animals coming from EU and
other European countries, and rabies-free
islands, to enter the UK without quarantine.
Pets from other countries will continue to be
subject to quarantine, though the position of
those from the United States and Canada will
be reviewed once the scheme is in full
operation, in April 2001 (with a pilot scheme
by April 2000). To enter the UK under the
scheme animals will need to have been
resident in a qualifying country and have
been:
• microchipped;
• vaccinated against rabies;
• blood-tested at an approved laboratory;
• issued with an official health certificate
detailing the fulfilment of these
precautions; and
• treated against exotic infections.
MAFF provides Helpline information on
020 8330 6835.
Pesticides
The Pesticides Safety Directorate, an
executive agency of MAFF, is responsible for
the evaluation and approval of agricultural
pesticides in England. It also carries out
evaluations and approvals on behalf of the
devolved administrations in Scotland and
Wales. There is rigorous evaluation of new
and existing pesticides under UK and EU
legislation. Regulations to strengthen
enforcement and provide greater public access
to information will be laid before Parliament
in autumn 1999. New arrangements for buffer
zones applied to certain pesticides to protect
aquatic life from spray drift were introduced
in March 1999 for the arable sector. These
allow farmers greater flexibility in the way
buffer zones are applied while maintaining
high environmental protection. The scheme
encourages the development of low-drift spray
technology. A similar scheme for orchard and
hop uses is currently being considered.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate,
another executive agency of MAFF, is
responsible for ensuring that veterinary
459
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
medicines are marketed only if they meet
statutory standards for safety, quality and
efficacy. The Government is advised by the
independent scientific Veterinary Products
Committee, one of whose tasks is to keep the
use of organophosphorus (OP) compounds in
veterinary medicines under review. Purchasers
of all OP or other sheep dips must have a
certificate of competence.
In response to concern about the increase of
micro-organisms resistant to antibiotics, the
EU has recently banned the use of four used
as growth promoters in animal feed.
The Fishing Industry
Scientists at the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea (ICES) have advised
the European Commission on a management
plan for 1999 for fishing quotas in accordance
with agreements signed at meetings of
ministers from North Sea countries at Esbjerg
in 1995 and at Bergen in 1998. The plan
involves drastic cuts in catch limits to protect
stocks from extinction.
The UK is one of the EU’s largest fishing
countries, taking about a quarter of the total
catch in major species and committing £36.8
million in 1998 to fisheries science and to
monitoring and developing stocks. It also has
an interest in more than 100 allowable catches
set by the Commission (see p. 461). In 1998
the British fishing industry provided about
53% by quantity of total UK fish supplies,
and household consumption of fish in the UK
was provisionally estimated at 448,000 tonnes.
Fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation, in
partnership with the European Commission,
concerning the fishing industry, including fish
and shellfish farming. The Sea Fish Industry
Authority (SFIA), an industry-financed body,
undertakes R&D, provides training and
promotes the marketing and consumption of
sea fish.
Fish Caught
In 1998 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 58% by weight
of total landings by British fishing vessels,
pelagic fish (caught near the surface) for 20%
and shellfish for 22%. Landings of all types of
fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels into the UK totalled 552,234
tonnes compared with 602,692 tonnes in 1997.
Cod and haddock represented 25% and 18%
respectively of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed. The quayside value of
landings of all sea fish, including shellfish, by
British vessels in 1998 was £484 million.
The Fishing Fleet
The UK fisheries departments currently
spend some £24 million a year on fisheries
enforcement, primarily on monitoring the
application of the Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP—see p. 461) and ensuring that measures
designed to conserve fish stocks are effective.
All British vessels fishing for profit must be
licensed by the fisheries departments. To help
conserve stocks and contain the size of the fleet,
only replacement licences are issued. Quotas
are allocated annually between producer
organisations and other groups of fishermen,
primarily on the basis of historic catches.
A satellite monitoring system, to track the
movements of EU vessels over 24 m in length,
as well as those from third countries fishing in
EU waters, will be fully operational from 1
January 2000. New controls over the landing
of fish were introduced from 5 January 1999.
It is a condition of UK fishing licences that,
subject to derogations for landings at
designated ports, at least four hours’ notice
must be given of all landings of whitefish and
shellfish into UK ports by vessels 20 m in
length and above. Measures to strengthen and
improve standards of fisheries control
throughout the EU were also adopted in
December 1998, providing for greater
transparency of action taken by member states
to monitor compliance with the CFP, and are
being phased in from July 1999.
Britain aims to achieve the EU target for
reducing its fleet through cutting its numbers
and limiting the time some vessels spend at
sea. At the end of 1998 the UK fleet consisted
of 7,644 registered vessels, including 270
deep-sea vessels greater than 27 m (88.5 ft)
overall length, of which 233 are registered.
There are an estimated 14,000 professional
fishermen in Britain.

AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Fish Farming and Shellfish Production
There are over 1,000 fish and shellfish farming
businesses in the UK, on 1,400 sites and
employing more than 3,000 people. Total value
is about £290 million at first sale. The main
finfish species are salmon (115,000 tonnes,
mainly in Scotland) and rainbow trout (16,000
tonnes), with a limited production of other
species, such as carp and brown trout. There is
also interest in farming marine species such as
turbot and halibut. Public subsidy during
1992-98 amounted to nearly £16 million.
Considerable government funds have also been
spent on aquaculture research, particularly on
disease control. A five-year LINK programme
(see p. 428), worth over £10 million, for
collaborative research between government
and industry on fish and shellfish farming, was
launched in 1995 to stimulate further
innovation and wealth creation in this sector.
The UK’s first commercial lobster
hatchery, a £400,000 project funded by
fishing groups, local authorities,
commercial organisations and the EU,
plans to open in 1999 at Padstow
(Cornwall). The project aims to reverse a
century-long decline in lobster numbers in
Cornish waters—from 253 tonnes in 1927
to a low of 63 tonnes in 1991 and 85 tonnes
in 1998—by producing 80,000 juvenile
lobsters a year to seed the lobster fishing
grounds around Cornwall. About 350
Cornish boats rely on shellfish catches for
a significant proportion of their earnings.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
UK coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
The EU’s CFP system for the management of
fishing resources sets total allowable catches
(TACs) each year in order to conserve stocks.
TACs are then allocated as quotas between
member states, taking account of traditional
fishing patterns. In December 1998, the EU
agreed large cuts in the number of fish caught
in the North Sea and other UK waters to help
rebuild stocks for the future. These included a
27% cut in the 4 AC for North Sea whiting
(from 60,000 tonnes in 1998 to 44,000 tonnes
in 1999); a 26% cut in the TAC for Scottish
West Coast haddock; and 23% cuts in Scottish
West Coast herring, North Sea haddock and
Irish Sea cod. The quota for North Sea cod
was reduced by 5%, from 140,000 tonnes to
132,000 tonnes.
In 1998-99, eight new North Sea TACs
(including for anglerfish, megrin and dogfish)
were introduced to help conserve stocks, with
the UK fishermen receiving the lion’s share of
quotas.
Since 1997 the number of over 10 m UK
vessels partly or wholly owned by overseas
interests has fallen from 160 to 140. From
1999 all vessels fishing against UK quotas are
required, with Commission approval, to show
that a satisfactory economic link is maintained
with British coastal communities, for example:
• by landing at least 50% of their catch of
quota stocks in the UK;
• by employing a crew of whom 50% are
resident in a UK coastal area; or
• by spending money in UK coastal areas
for goods and services.
As a contribution to the economic link
requirements, 50 extra tonnes of sole quota is
being made available to the UK’s inshore
fishing fleet by UK-Dutch boats.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU member states have historic rights in
British waters between 6 and 12 miles. British
vessels have similar rights in other member
states’ 6 to 12 mile belts. Between 12 and 200
miles, EU vessels may fish wherever they have
access rights. Non-EU countries’ vessels may
fish in these waters if they negotiate reciprocal
fisheries agreements with the EU.
Technical conservation measures
supplement TACs and controls on the time
spent at sea. 4 hey include minimum mesh
sizes for nets and net configuration
restrictions, minimum landing sizes and

closed areas designed mainly to protect young
fish. Conservation measures in English and
Welsh waters have increased stocks of sea
bass. There are 37 nursery areas around the
coasts, where fishing for bass for all or part of
the year is prohibited.
Each member state is responsible for
enforcement of CFP rules on its own
fishermen and those of other member states in
its own waters. EU inspectors monitor
compliance. In December 1998, new measures
were introduced to increase the effectiveness
of EU enforcements.
Fisheries Agreements
CFP provisions are supplemented by a
number of fisheries agreements between the
EU and third countries, the most important
for the UK being with Norway (for cod,
haddock, saithe, redfish and Greenland
halibut), Greenland and the Faroes. EU catch
quotas, especially for cod, have also been
established around Spitsbergen (Svalbard). In
January 1999 the moratorium (since 1992) on
the issue of external waters licences (EWLs)
came to an end and new EWLs are available to
enable UK vessels to fish in those external
waters not fully subscribed, in accordance
with international conventions and
agreements.
Salmon, Freshwater Fisheries and the
Aquatic Environment
In 1998 the ICES advised that stocks of multi¬
sea-winter salmon (MSW) in the North
Atlantic had fallen to unprecedentedly low
levels and recommended that the level of
exploitation of MSW should be significantly
reduced in 1999. The Environment Agency,
responsible for day-to-day management in
England and Wales, submitted a number of
measures to reduce exploitation by both nets
and rods. The Agency by-laws, confirmed by
the Government with modifications in April
1999, included a delay in the opening of the
netting season until 1 June, with certain
exemptions, and mandatory catch and release
by anglers until 16 June.
Scottish salmon farmers have been offered
up to £9 million of government funds over
three years as compensation for their costs in
eradicating Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA),
a viral disease which has been confirmed at ten
sites in Scotland and is suspected at 15 more,
out of a total of 335 farms. Some 3,100 tonnes
of fish have been withdrawn from the ten
sites.
There is no public right to fish in
freshwater lakes and non-tidal rivers in Great
Britain. Those wishing to fish such waters
must first obtain permission from the owner
of the fishing rights and, in England and
462
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Wales, a licence from the Environment
Agency. In Scotland salmon fisheries are
managed locally by District Salmon Fishery
Boards. In Northern Ireland fishing for
freshwater species is licensed by the Fisheries
Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland and
the Foyle Fisheries Commission in their
respective areas, and 62 public angling waters,
including salmon, trout and coarse fisheries,
are available to Department of Agriculture
permit holders.
Research
Departmental funding of commissioned R&D
in agriculture, fisheries and food in 1998-99
included ,£121 million from MAFF and ,£5.3
million from the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland. In Scotland about ,£50
million is invested in the Agricultural and
Biological Sciences-related research
programme. Priority areas in the MAFF
programme are public health (covering food
safety, transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies and zoonoses) and protection
of the environment (improved sustainability in
production methods, with benefits for the
environment and agricultural efficiency).
Research Bodies
The BBSRC (see p. 437) supports research in
biotechnology and biological sciences related
to food and agriculture. The Natural
Environment Research Council includes some
agricultural aspects in its remit. Research
institutes sponsored by these councils receive
income from work commissioned by MAFF,
industry and other bodies.
ADAS carries out R&D, at a network of
research centres and on clients’ premises, for
MAFF and other organisations and
companies. There are research centres across
England and Wales. MAFF receives scientific
expertise and technical support from its other
agencies, the VLA and the Central Science
Laboratory. Horticulture Research
International, a non-departmental public
body, transfers the results of its R&D to the
British horticulture industry and the wider
public. It is in its third year of a five-year
project on forecasting productivity, quality
and availability in outdoor flower crops, at a
total cost of ,£385,000.
SERAD support for agricultural, biological
and related sciences is achieved primarily
through sponsoring the five Scottish
Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes,
the SAC and the Royal Botanic Garden in
Edinburgh. It contracts additional research
through these bodies and provides funding for
Education and Advisory Services at the SAC.
In Northern Ireland the Department of
Agriculture maintains an integrated Science
and Technology programme to improve the
economic performance of the agri-food, fishing
and forestry sectors, to conserve the rural
environment and to strengthen the economy
and social infrastructure of disadvantaged rural
areas.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.5 million
hectares (6.2 million acres) in the UK: a little
less than 8% of England, nearly 16% of
Scotland, 12% of Wales and 6% of Northern
Ireland. This is about 10% of the total land
area and well below the 30% average for the
whole of Europe. The EU’s forests are
estimated to be increasing by about 486
million cubic metres (17.16 billion cubic feet)
a year, while the annual harvest has fallen to
313 million cubic metres (11.05 billion cubic
feet) owing to cheaper imports and an over¬
supply of timber.
Britain’s forestry programme aims to
protect and expand forest resources and
conserve woodland as a home for wildlife and
for public recreation. The UK imports 85% of
its timber and wood products, which costs
about £8 billion a year. Promoting the market
for home-grown timber is an important part of
the forestry programme.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.2 million hectares (5.5 million
acres), 35% of which is managed by the
Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting (including natural regeneration) in
1997-98 was 131 hectares (324 acres) by the
Commission and 15,912 hectares (39,319
acres) by other woodland owners, with the
help of grants from the Commission. In
1997-98, 11,585 hectares (28,628 acres) of
463
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
broadleaved trees were planted—both new
planting and restocking.
Forestry and primary wood processing
employ about 35,000 people. Great Britain’s
woodlands produced 9.05 million cubic metres
(320 million cubic feet) of timber in 1997,
15% of total UK consumption. The volume of
timber harvested on Commission lands in
1997-98 was estimated at 4.66 million cubic
metres (164 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants (£35.5 million in
1997-98) to help create new woodlands and
forests, and regenerate existing ones. Under the
scheme a management grant is available for work
in woods of special conservation and landscape
value or where the public are welcome.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry
Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the government department
responsible for forestry in Great Britain. With
1.06 million hectares of land (2.6 million
acres), it is the UK’s largest land manager and
the biggest single provider of countryside
recreation. The Commissioners advise on
forestry matters and are responsible to the
Scottish First Minister, the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the
National Assembly for Wales.
The Commission provides grants to private
woodland owners for tree planting and
woodland management, controls tree felling,
and sets standards for forestry as a whole.
Forest Enterprise, an agency of the
Commission, develops and manages the
Commission’s forests and forestry estate,
supplying timber and opportunities for
recreation, and enhancing nature conservation
and the forest environment. Forest Research is
the R&D agency of the Commission.

partly by receipts from sales of timber and
other produce, and from rents, the

Commission’s grant in aid for 1997-98 was
£58 million, from which £9 million was
deducted for reimbursement of EU co-
financing of private woodlands grants.
As part of its strategy, announced in 1998, to
restore Britain’s woodland heritage, the
Government plans to spend £40 million a year
planting new trees in England. Emphasis is on
the right mix of trees in the right place, with a
ban on commercial planting of conifers.
During 1981-98, 233,440 hectares (583,600
acres), worth £258.1 million, of Forestry
Commission land were sold, of which over 60%
was forest land. The Government has imposed
a moratorium on large-scale forest sales.
Forestry Initiatives
With an estimated 1,000 sq km (386 sq miles)
of damaged land to be developed, the initial
focus of the Forestry Commission’s Land
Regeneration Unit is on the creation of new
woodlands (of 30 hectares—74 acres—or
larger) in the central English coalfields and on
wider plans to create working forests of about
800-1,200 hectares (1,980-2,970 acres). It has
identified 175,000 hectares (432,400 acres) of
Further Reading
derelict land suitable for trees that will
stabilise and decontaminate the soil. The
planned National Forest in England (520 sq
km—200 sq miles) covers parts of
Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire,
with the aim of increasing woodland from 6%
to a third of its area—16,500 hectares (40,775
acres). For Community Forests, see p. 326.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 82,000
hectares (203,000 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(150,700 acres).
The Forest Service is an executive agency
within the Department of Agriculture and is
responsible for promoting the interests of
forestry. It achieves this through sustainable
management and expansion of State-owned
forests and the encouragement of private
forestry through grant aid for planting. The
Forest Service offered 290,500 cubic metres
(10.3 million cubic feet) of timber for sale
during 1998 and receipts from this sale
totalled £4.78 million. Forestry and timber
processing employ about 1,100 people.

28 Manufacturing and
Construction
Introduction 466 Construction
Sectors of Manufacturing 466
Manufacturing continues to play an important role in the modern economy,
although services now generate about three times as much gross domestic
product (GDP) and four times as much employment. The UK excels in
industries such as chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, motor
vehicles and components, aerospace, offshore equipment, and paper and
printing, where British companies are among the world’s largest and most
successful. Britain’s construction industry has made its mark around the world
and continues to be involved in some of the most celebrated building projects
both at home and abroad.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 19.7% of gross
value added (at current basic prices) in 1998
and for 16.8% of employment (4 million
people) in the UK in 1999. The East
Midlands and West Midlands have the highest
proportion of manufacturing employees and
London the lowest. Almost all manufacturing
is carried out by private sector businesses.
Overseas companies have a strong presence
(see p. 422), being responsible for a quarter of
manufacturing output in the UK.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a
decline in manufacturing output, but it began
to rise again in 1993. By 1998, the volume of
output was 10% above the level in 1991 and
1992, but has declined a little since. Some
industries, including chemicals, rubber and
plastic products, electrical and optical
equipment, and transport equipment, have
achieved substantial growth following the
recession, but output of other sectors,
including textiles, leather and wood products,
remains well below their 1990 levels.
The construction industry contributed
5.3% of gross value added in 1998. Following
a period of marked decline as recession
affected the industry in the early 1990s,
output has picked up since 1993 and was 9.2%
higher in 1998 than in 1993, although still
below pre-recession levels.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises are shown in
Table 28.1. An outline of the main
manufacturing sectors is given below. A brief
statistical summary is included for most
sectors, taken from the appropriate Office for
National Statistics (ONS) sector review. In
some circumstances, statistics in these
summaries may differ from figures in the text

1 he manufacturing base at the turn of the 20th century was much larger than it is now. In
1901, statistics for employment in textile factories showed that over 1 million people were
employed in this industry alone, over half of whom worked in cotton factories. Almost twice as
mam women as men were employed, as were over 36,000 children under 14 (as half-timers).

Food, Drink and Tobacco
Food and Drink
The UK’s food and drink manufacturing and
processing industry has accounted for a
growing proportion of total domestic food
supply since the 1940s. The largest
concentration of enterprises is to be found in
the production of bread, cakes and fresh
pastry goods, followed by those engaged in
processing and preserving fruit and
vegetables. The greatest number of food-based
jobs are in Yorkshire (15.7% in 1997), the
South East and London (12%), and the North
West (11.4%). Spirits production gives
Scotland the highest concentration of
employment in the alcoholic and soft drinks
manufacturing industry (about 30% of drinks
manufacturing employment), with a
significant proportion of jobs in its
economically deprived rural areas; the South
East has the second highest concentration
(about 20%) of drinks-related jobs. By far the

biggest food and drinks export category is
alcoholic drinks, which account for nearly a
third of the value of total food and drink sales
overseas; the largest food exporting sector is
biscuits and confectionery.
Among the biggest companies involved in
food manufacturing and processing are
Unilever, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle,
Associated British Foods, Tate and Lyle,
Unigate, Northern Foods, United Biscuits,
Hillsdown Holdings, Hazlewood Foods and
Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM). Diageo
(formed by the merger of Guinness and
Grand Metropolitan) had a turnover of £17.7
billion in the 18 months to June 1998 and
around 70,000 employees. As well as being
one of the world’s leading producers of spirits,
it has other extensive food and drink interests,
468
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
including Burger King, the world’s second
largest restaurant chain. Allied Domecq is also
among the world’s leading alcoholic drinks
companies, with significant operations in
wines and spirits. Specialist small and
medium-sized firms in the food and drink
manufacturing industry thrive alongside these
large concerns, supplying high-quality ‘niche’
products, often to small retail outlets, such as
delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as frozen potato products and
ready-prepared meals, fish and shellfish
dishes, salads and pasta, together with
yogurts, desserts and instant snacks, have
formed some of the fastest-growing sectors of
the food market in recent years. The range of
ready-cooked meals is expanding rapidly.
Many new low-fat and fat-free items are being
introduced, ranging from dairy products to
complete prepared meals, and organic foods
are also becoming more widely available.
There has been a substantial rise in sales of
vegetarian foods (both natural vegetable dishes
and vegetable-based substitutes of meat
products, where soya plays a big role). For
genetically modified foods, see chapter 27.
Around 29% of liquid milk in the UK is
distributed through a doorstep delivery
system employing about 21,000 people; the
proportion is, however, declining as
supermarkets increase their share of the
market. Household consumption of liquid
milk per head—2.23 litres (3.93 pints) a
week—is among the highest in the world.
Consumption of skimmed and semi-skimmed
milk accounted for 64% of total milk sales in
1998. The British dairy industry accounts for
about 79% of butter and 67% of cheese
supplies to the domestic market, and achieves
significant sales in overseas markets.
Bread production in 1998 was over 1.8
million tonnes. The two largest producers are
Allied Bakeries, owned by Associated British
Foods, and British Bakeries which is part of
RHM, owned by the Tomkins Group. The
UK’s largest plant cake producer (Manor
Bakeries/Mr Kipling/Lyons) is also part of
RHM. A recent innovation—long-life
bread—now accounts for more than 4% of the
plant bread market. Production of bagels grew
by 57% between 1996 and 1998. The morning
goods market (including rolls, croissants,
scones and teacakes) grew by 5% in 1998, with
an estimated retail value of ^417 million. A
feature of the bread-making market is a move
towards production in in-store bakeries,
notably in supermarkets. Part-baked bread
(which allows newly baked bread to be
available throughout the day in a matter of
minutes) is sold, for example, to in-store
bakeries and restaurants. Other trends have
been a steady increase in the varieties
available, and the growth of the sandwich
market. Sales of ready-made sandwiches
through major multiples and sandwich bars,
etc. are now worth £2.8 billion a year.
The brewing industry has four major
national brewery groups—Scottish Courage,
Bass, Whitbread and Carlsberg-Tetley—and
500 regional and local brewers of beer. British
malt, which is made almost entirely from
home-grown barley, is used by brewers
throughout the world. Lager now accounts for
60% of all beer sales, but there is still a
demand for the vast range of traditional cask-
conditioned and brewery-conditioned ales and
stouts. Recently there has been a shift towards
stronger bottled beers, a significant proportion
of which are imported. Another recent trend
has been a sizeable import of beer bought on
the continent, mainly in Calais, by British
travellers. The main brewers are modernising
and rationalising their brewing and
distribution facilities to meet the changing
pattern of demand, while also taking action to
develop their public houses (pubs) and
restaurants, concentrating increasingly on
branded’ or ‘themed’ pubs and restaurants.
The Scotch whisky industry is one of the
UK’s top export earners, with overseas sales
worth £2.0 billion in 1998. About 90% of
production is exported to 200 markets
worldwide, the European Union (EU) taking
45%, the United States 13% and Japan 6% by
volume. Some 12,000 people work in the
Scotch whisky industry and a further 48,000
are employed in associated sectors, for
instance supplying ingredients and materials.
There are over 90 Scotch whisky distilleries in
Scotland, producing either malt whisky or
grain whisky. Most Scotch whisky consumed
is a blend of malt and grain. Examples of well-
known blended brands are J & B, Johnnie
469
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Walker, Chivas Regal, Ballantine’s Famous
Grouse, Bell’s and Teacher’s. Glenfiddich,
Glenmorangie, Glen Grant and Macallan are
some of the best-known single malt Scotch
whiskies. Gin and vodka production are also
important parts of the spirits industry.
In a highly competitive market, English and
Welsh wines have a distinctive local identity.
Some 386 vineyards and 134 wineries, mainly
in the south, produce an average of 1.5 million
litres of wine a year, most of which is white.
Quality continues to improve with a
combination of more experienced winemakers,
modern technologies and better winemaking
equipment. Cider is made primarily in south¬
west England, and in Gloucestershire,
Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
The soft drinks industry produces still and
carbonated drinks, dilutable drinks, fruit juices
and juice drinks, natural mineral waters, and
spring and table waters. The UK market is
worth more than £6.8 billion a year, with
Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages the
largest supplier. It is one of the fastest-grow ing
sectors of the grocery trade, responsible for
introducing many innovative products each
year. Bottled waters have experienced the
fastest growth within the sector during the past
five years, averaging increases in value of 10%
a year. In 1998 the British consumed 175 litres
of soft drinks per person, compared with 128
litres in 1988—an increase of 37%; there was
an increase in 1998 in the volume of the still
fruit drinks market of 50%.
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures
around 90% of the cigarettes and tobacco
goods sold in the UK. The market is supplied
by three major manufacturers—Imperial
Tobacco Ltd, Gallaher Ltd and Rothmans
(UK) Ltd (which recently became part of
British American Tobacco). British American
Tobacco is also a major manufacturer, which
mainly markets its products outside the UK,
providing 16% of the world’s cigarette
supply—900 billion cigarettes in 1998. The
industry specialises in the production of high-
quality cigarettes made from flue-cured
tobacco, and achieves significant export
sales—^1.1 billion in 1998. Europe, the
Middle East and Africa are important overseas
markets. The UK tobacco industry is one of
the top ten balance-of-payments earners in
UK manufacturing industry.
Textiles, Clothing and Footwear
Annual turnover in the UK textiles, clothing
and footwear industry is around £20 billion,
and about 308,000 people are employed. The
sector has been significantly affected by
competition from imported goods, and in 1998
the volume of sales was 11% below the level in
1995. To meet the intense competition, UK
textile and clothing manufacturers have
modernised and rationalised their domestic
operations, and in some cases have invested in
production facilities abroad. In addition, firms
are shifting into higher-value products, to
benefit from the UK’s strengths in fashion,
design and information technology. New
technologies, largely designed to improve
response times and give greater flexibility in
production, are being used throughout the
industries. British textile firms remain world
leaders in wool and worsted and technical
textiles.
For textiles, there is a high degree of
regional concentration: cotton textiles in the
North West, fine knitwear in Scotland, linen
in Northern Ireland, woollens and worsteds in
Yorkshire, and knitwear in the East Midlands.
The clothing industry is more dispersed
throughout the UK, with significant
concentrations in the West Midlands, and
north and east London. The principal textile
and clothing products are spun textile fibres,
woven and knitted fabrics, household and
industrial textiles, carpets based chiefly on
wool, cotton and synthetic fibres, as well as a
full range of clothing and footwear.
The UK textile and clothing industries
comprise a few substantial multi-process
companies, but are mainly dominated by small
and medium-sized firms, some of which
subcontract work to other companies or to
home workers. Two of the world’s major
groups are Coats Viyella, and Courtaulds
Textiles, with turnover of almost £2.4 billion
and £0.9 billion, respectively, in 1997. Raw
wool is scoured and cleaned in the UK in
preparation for woollen and worsted spinning

and weaving. (Worsted is a fine wool fabric
often used for making suits.) British mills also
process rare fibres such as cashmere and
angora. Production includes yarn and fabrics
of cotton, synthetic fibres and cotton-
synthetic mixes, with large-scale dyeing and
printing of cotton and synthetic fibre fabric.
The high quality and variety of design make
the UK one of the world’s leading producers
of woven carpets.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of textile industry output, covering
such items as conveyor belting and geotextiles
used in civil engineering. Many of these are
non-woven. Synthetic polypropylene yarn is
used in the manufacture of carpet backing and
ropes, and woven into fabrics for a wide range
of applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries.
The clothing industry is more labour-
intensive than textiles. While a broad range of
clothing is imported from Europe and Asia,
British industry supplies nearly two-fifths of
domestic demand. Until 1997 exports rose
consistently through the 1990s, since the
British fashion designer industry regained
prominence during the 1980s, and traditional
design and high-quality production enable
branded clothing companies such as Daks
Simpson and Jaeger to compete successfully
overseas. UK firms have had success in the
growing market for branded street and club
wear. Exports have, however, fallen both in
1997 and 1998.
Output ot footwear has been particularly
affected by the strength of sterling and
increasing competitiveness of imports.
Footwear manufacturers, with around 18,000
employees, are predominantly found in
Northamptonshire, Somerset, Leicestershire
and Lancashire. Nearly 50% of production by
value is exported, with the UK particularly
renowned for classic men’s formal shoes and
youth street fashion footwear.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
The UK paper and board sector has a
relatively small number of medium and large
firms—97 paper and board mills, employing
22,000 people—whereas printing in particular
has a very large number of small businesses.
Paper and board are produced for further
industrial processing, corrugated paper, sacks,
bags, cartons, boxes, household goods,
stationery and a host of other articles.
Production has been increasingly concentrated
in large-scale units to enable the industry to
compete more effectively; between 1987 and
1998 output in the pulp and paper industry
increased by 6.5%. Over half the industry is
made up of forestry product companies from
Scandinavia, North America, Australia and
elsewhere. Among the biggest British-owned
groups in terms of production are St Regis,
BPB Paperboard and Arjo Wiggins. There has
been a significant trend towards waste-based

paper is increasing, and recycled paper made
up 52.4% of the raw material for UK
newspapers in 1998.
Much publishing and printing employment
and output is carried out in firms based in
south-east England. Mergers have led to the
formation of large groups in newspaper,
magazine and book publishing. Pearson, with
turnover of almost ^2.4 billion in 1998,
controls some of the world’s leading
educational publishing businesses. The British
book-publishing industry is a major exporter;
in 1998 it issued almost 103,000 new titles.
The UK printing industry has an annual
turnover of around £12.5 billion and employs
203,000 people in Great Britain. It is undergoing
significant technological change, with digital
technology enabling much greater automation
and standardisation, while colour printing is
becoming cheaper and more widely available.
The UK runs a notable trade surplus in printing
and publishing—£824 million in 1998. Exports
are dominated by books and periodicals, and
imports by books and trade advertising.
Chemicals and Chemical Products
The chemicals industry is one of the UK’s major
manufacturing sectors, directly employing
249,000 people in over 3,600 companies. It had
total product sales of £33 billion in 1997, of
which two-thirds was exported. The sector does,
however, also underpin much of the rest of UK
manufacturing industry, with chemicals being
essential feedstocks for most other industrial
processes.
It is a diverse industry, with important
representation in all primary chemical sectors—
ranging from bulk petrochemicals to low-
volume, high-value specialised organics. It
includes key industrial materials such as plastics
and synthetic rubber, and other products such
as man-made fibres, soaps, detergents,
cosmetics, adhesives, dyes and inks, and
intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry.

sector, including such products as ethylene,
propylene, benzene and methanol. These
provide the basic building blocks for the
manufacture of many downstream chemical
products, including polymers used for the
manufacture of plastics products; and
synthetic fibres such as nylon, polyamide,
polyester and acrylics used in the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries.
There is substantial inorganics production,
with sales of some ^2 billion a year—
including sulphuric acid, chlorine and caustic
soda, based upon minerals such as salt,
sulphur, and phosphate ores or reaction
between gases. These also serve many other
downstream chemical processes.
Formulated Products
The UK is also strong in the ‘formulation’ of
chemical products, in areas such as paints,
inks, soaps and detergents, and cosmetics
and perfumes. The coatings industry on its
own has annual sales of around £2 billion.
Home decorative products include
household names such as Dulux and Crown
Paints. The industrial coatings sector
includes decoration on cans, and anti-fouling
marine coatings.
Specialty Chemicals
For the chemicals industry, the last few years
have brought increasingly rapid market and
technological changes. Imperial Chemical
Industries pic (ICI) is one of the world’s
largest specialty chemicals groups, with
turnover of more than £9 billion in 1998, and
is one of the world’s largest paint producers
(with manufacturing in 25 countries and sales
in over 120). The development of specialty
chemicals to meet specific needs through the
application of sophisticated ‘chemistry’
illustrates this dimension. The
pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors are
at the forefront of such innovation. In recent
years, the application of chirality1 in synthesis
has allowed firms such as AstraZeneca to

make drugs that are more closely tailored to
targets.
Pharmaceuticals
The British pharmaceuticals industry, which
is largely based in the South East and North
West, is the world’s second largest exporter of
medicines, accounting for about 11.5% of the
world export market. It manufactures the
complete range of medicinal products—
human and veterinary medicines, medical
dressings and dental materials. In recent
times, the largest growth has been in
medicines that act on the respiratory system,
followed by cardiovascular, muscular and
skeletal, anti-infective and alimentary tract
remedies. Pharmaceutical exports in 1998
reached £6.3 billion. The main overseas
markets are North America, Japan and
Western Europe.
Over 400 pharmaceutical manufacturers
and research organisations operate in the UK,
including several British and US parent
multinationals which dominate production.
Glaxo Wellcome (employing about 53,100
people and operating in 57 countries),
SmithKline Beecham and AstraZeneca feature
in the top ten UK-based companies (see
p. 385). The merger in April 1999 between
Zeneca and the Swedish company Astra is the
biggest European merger to date in this sector,
and with annual sales of £6.25 billion
AstraZeneca has become the world’s third
biggest pharmaceuticals company.
Some 60,000 people work in the
pharmaceuticals industry, of whom about a
third are engaged in R&D; another 250,000
are employed in related sectors. The industry
invested £2.5 billion in R&D in 1998, about
one-fifth of British industry’s total R&D
expenditure. Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline
Beecham and AstraZeneca are the UK’s top
three companies in terms of R&D
expenditure (see Table 26.1, p. 426). US
multinational group Pfizer has invested in
expansion of its medicines research centre at
Sandwich, Kent. Pfizer is also to site its new
UK and European corporate headquarters at
Walton Dales, Reigate, Surrey in a £50
million investment.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Major developments pioneered in the UK
are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for ulcers, asthma, arthritis,
migraine, coronary heart disease and erectile
dysfunction (Viagra was developed in the UK
by Pfizer). The UK pharmaceuticals industry
has discovered and developed more leading
medicines than any other country apart from
the United States, including 13 of the world’s
current top 50 best-selling drugs. UK
laboratories put about 20 new pharmaceutical
products on the market each year. Among the
best-selling drugs produced by the three
largest UK-owned companies are:
• Glaxo Wellcome—Zantac (for treating
ulcers), Imigran (migraine), Zofran (for
countering the unpleasant side-effects of
cancer treatment), Serevent (respiratory
disease) and Epivir (HIV/AIDS);
• SmithKline Beecham—Augmentin (for
treating a wide range of infections),
Seroxat/Paxil (for depression) and
Relifex/Relafen (for arthritis); and
• AstraZeneca—Losec (an anti-ulcer
drug), Zestril (heart disease), Tenormin
(beta blocker), Zoladex (a prostate cancer
therapy), Nolvadex (a breast cancer
treatment), Diprivan (an anaesthetic),
Pulmicort (for asthma), Plendil (heart
disease/angina), Seloken (beta blocker)
and Xylocaine (local anaesthetic).
Biotechnology
The UK biotechnology industry is second
only to that of the United States, employing
an estimated 14,000 people directly. As well as
AstraZeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham, there are some 270
smaller specialist dedicated biotechnology
firms—about a quarter of the number in
Europe—with particular strengths in
biopharmaceuticals. The industry benefits
strongly from British universities’
considerable expertise in the biosciences and
related disciplines. Important R&D activities
include gene therapy, genomics,
bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry,
regulation of the cell cycle, and the
development of transgenic animals as sources
of organs and as bioreactors.
Man-made Fibres
Synthetic fibres are supplied to the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries. The main
types of synthetic fibre are still those first
developed in the 1940s: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major synthetic
fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a variety of innovative products;
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are
examples. More specialist products include
the aramids (with very high thermal stability
and strength), elastanes (giving very high
stretch and recovery) and melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or
weaving).
Courtaulds (acquired by Akzo Nobel of the
Netherlands in 1998) is one of the biggest
chemical companies in the UK. It was
responsible for developing the first new
artificial fibre for decades, Tencel, a solvent-
spun, biodegradable fibre, which is twice as
strong as cotton but soft enough to be used by
designers of luxury garments.
Rubber and Plastics Products
Over 234,000 people are employed by over
6,800 enterprises in the rubber and plastics
industries. Rubber products include tyres and
tubes, pipes, hoses, belting and floor
coverings, and many have applications in the
automotive industry. The largest firms in this
sector are major tyre manufacturers such as
Goodyear and Michelin. The highest
concentrations of plastics employment are in
the West Midlands (with 16.4% of total
employment), the North West, the East
Midlands and the South East. Plastics have a
multitude of applications in the packaging,
building, electrical and electronic, transport,
medical, household goods and clothing
industries. The UK’s plastics industry
continues to be a world leader in material
specification and design, with new processes
allowing stronger plastics to replace traditional
materials and develop new applications.

Among the larger firms in a sector
characterised by many small and medium¬
sized businesses is British Polythene
Industries, manufacturing products such as
carrier bags, sacks and shrink film. In the
moulded plastics sector, Linpac’s output
includes food packaging and components for
the automotive sector.
Glass, Ceramics and Building Materials
The UK is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass used in windows, doors and cladding.
Flat glass is made through the float process,
developed by Pilkington pic and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. About half
of Pilkington’s sales are in glass products for
buildings, while the company is the world’s
largest supplier of glass for cars, with about
one-quarter of vehicles containing its glass.
Total industry turnover in 1997-98 was £2.1
billion. The manufacture and supply of
windows and doors are carried out by a large
number of other companies operating in one
of three basic product sectors—timber, metal
(aluminium and steel) and UPVC. The UK
also has several leading lead crystal suppliers
such as Wedgwood, Dartington, Edinburgh
Crystal and Royal Brierley.
The ceramics industry manufactures
domestic ceramic tableware, as well as
durables such as sanitaryware, tiles and clay
pipes for the building trade. It is heavily
concentrated in the West Midlands. Domestic
tableware production includes fine china, bone
china, earthenware and stoneware. Tableware
is produced predominantly in Stoke-on-
Trent. The UK is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers and exporters of fine bone
china: Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Doulton
are among the most famous names. Research
is being conducted into ceramics use in
housebuilding and diesel and jet engines.
Important industrial ceramics invented in the
UK include some forms of silicon carbide and
sialons, which can withstand ultra-high
temperatures.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel
quarried by the aggregates industry (with a
total volume of 220 million tonnes in Great
Britain in 1997) is used in construction. The
brick industry, one of the UK’s oldest, is
regarded as the world’s most technically
advanced. In 1998 some 3 billion bricks were
produced in Great Britain. Portland cement, a
19th-century British innovation, is the most
widely used chemical compound in the world.
Blue Circle is the UK’s largest producer of
cement. Almost 85 million sq m of concrete
building blocks were produced in Great
Britain in 1998.
The UK is a major exporter of china clay

fillers in paper-making, the remainder going
into the ceramic, paint, rubber and plastics
industries. The main producer is English
China Clays International (ECCI), part of the
English China Clays Group, which had
turnover of £834 million in 1998. ECCI is
being taken over by a French company; the
combined company would, subject to
regulatory agreement, control some 35% of
the world market in high-quality kaolin.
Metals and Fabricated Metal Products
The Industrial Revolution in the UK was based
to a considerable extent on the manufacture of
iron and steel and heavy machinery. These
sectors remain important parts of the industrial
economy. The major areas of steel production
are now concentrated in south Wales and
northern England, with substantial processing
in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Major
restructuring in the steel industry took place
during the 1980s and 1990s. Metals can be
recycled many times; every year the British
metals recycling industry processes about 10
million tonnes of scrap metal.
From total crude steel output of 17.3
million tonnes, British producers delivered
15.5 million tonnes of finished steel in 1998, of
which 54% was exported to well over 100
countries. Nearly three-quarters of UK steel
exports go to other EU member states.
Germany is the UK’s biggest market. Since
1990 annual steel industry exports have
increased by 21.5%—they were worth £3.6
billion in 1998. In 1998, British Steel was the
sixth largest steel producer in the world,
employing 44,000 people worldwide (of whom
34,000 are in the UK) and producing 86% of
the UK’s total crude steel. In 1999, British
Steel announced a proposed merger with
Hoogovens, the large Dutch metals producer,
which would create Europe’s biggest
steelmaker and the third largest in the world.
British Steel’s output is based on semi¬
finished steel, strip mill products, plate, heavy
sections, bars, wire rods and tubes. These are
used principally in the construction,
automotive, engineering, transport, metal
goods, packaging and energy industries.
British Steel is Europe’s biggest producer of
engineering steels—specialist grades used to
make components for the automotive and
aerospace industries. It owns 51% of Avesta
Sheffield, one of Europe’s leading stainless
steel producers.
Products manufactured by other UK steel
companies include reinforcing bars for the
construction industry, wire rod, hot rolled
bars, bright bars, tubes, and wire and wire
products. The production of special steels is
centred on the Sheffield area and includes
stainless and alloy special steels for the
aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.
Steel has had a notable success in UK
construction, with its market share of
buildings of two or more storeys more than
doubling from 30% in the early 1980s to 65%
today. It has 90% of the single storey market.
Total iron and steel sector sales are about £3.3
billion a year and consumption of
constructional steelwork over 1 million tonnes.
Several multinational companies, including
Alcan, Norsk Hydro, Kaiser, MIM and
Quexco, have plants in Britain producing non-
ferrous metals. The aluminium industry,
which has raised its productivity and
competitiveness significantly in recent years,
supplies customers in the aerospace, transport,
automotive and construction industries. Other
important non-ferrous metal sectors are
copper and copper alloys, used for electrical

wire, cables and machinery, connectors,
automotive components, plumbing and
building products, and heat exchangers,
boilers, tubing and electrical gear; lead for lead
acid batteries and roofing; zinc for galvanising
to protect steel; nickel, used principally as an
alloying element to make stainless steel and
high temperature turbine alloys; and titanium
for high-strength, low-weight aerospace
applications. Despite an overall decline in the
castings industry, some foundries have
invested in new melting, moulding and quality
control equipment.
Fabricated metal products include pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for
chemical and oil-refining plant; steam-raising
boilers; nuclear reactors; water and sewage
treatment plant; and steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations. Other
products include central heating radiators and
boilers, cutlery, tools and general hardware.
Machinery and Domestic Appliances
The highest concentration of employment in
these industries is to be found in the West
Midlands (with 16.1% of total employment),
followed by the South East (12.4%) and the
Eastern region (11.4%). Mechanical machine-
building is an area in which British firms
excel, especially internal combustion engines,
power transmission equipment, pumps and
compressors, wheeled tractors, construction
and earth-moving equipment, and textile
machinery.
The UK is a major producer of industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and
of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment. The
Weir Group is the world’s sixth biggest
producer of pumps. Companies such as
Mitsui-Babcock manufacture steam generators
and other heavy equipment for power plants.
Alstom, which shares a joint venture with
ABB in power generation, is one of only a
handful of firms in the world which can
supply the major components for a complete
power station project and the transformers
and switchgear needed in transmission and
distribution of electricity. In the UK the
company’s strengths are steam turbine
manufacture, switchgear manufacture,
industrial gas turbines, and project design and
management. The mechanical lifting and
handling equipment industry makes cranes
and transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. The
commercial heating, ventilation, air-
conditioning and refrigeration sector is served
to a great extent by small and medium-sized
firms, although several large multinational
companies have sites in Britain.
Tractors and equipment used in
agriculture, horticulture, forestry, sportsturf
and gardens achieved export sales of £1.7
billion in 1998. This is largely due to three
major multinationals with tractor plants in
Britain which, together with JCB Landpower,
export to nearly every country in the world. A
range of specialist and innovative golf, parks
and sports field machinery, lawn and garden
products, and agricultural equipment
complement the tractor business.
Most machine tools—mechanically
operated tools for working on metal, wood or
plastics—are bought by engineering,
aerospace, automotive and metal goods
industries, both at home and overseas (exports
of just over £1 billion in 1998 accounted for
42% of turnover). Computer numerical-
controlled machines make up an increasing
proportion of output. Overseas-owned
manufacturers (including those from the

significant involvement in the UK machine
tool industry, in which half of the top 20
companies are British; the 600 Group is the
biggest British company.
The mining and tunnelling equipment
industry leads the world in the production of
coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
JCB, Europe’s biggest construction equipment
manufacturer, is the world’s largest producer
of backhoe loaders and telescopic handlers,
and a major exporter. The UK possesses the
second largest engineering construction sector
in the world. It serves the whole spectrum of
process industries, although oil, gas and
related industries are areas of particular
strength. Most sales of textile machinery are
to export markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms. British companies also make advanced
printing machinery and ceramic processing
equipment, and other types of production
machinery.
The domestic appliance sector
manufactures major appliances, such as
washing machines, cookers, refrigerators and
dishwashers, as well as heating, water heaters
and showers, ventilation products, floor
cleaners and vacuum cleaners, and small
appliances for the kitchen and bathroom.
There are around 100 companies of all sizes in
the UK. Energy efficiency and water
conservation are progressively improving in
home laundry products, and new technology is
being applied to tumble dryers, frost-free
refrigeration, cookers and microwave ovens.
Visual design of what were traditionally ‘white
goods’ is changing, giving a new look to
kitchens, and modern design is also being
applied to small appliances such as kettles and
toasters. The UK is Europe’s largest
manufacturer of tumble dryers, with a trade
surplus in this product of around £40 million.
Electrical and Optical Equipment
Production of office machinery and computers
has more than trebled since 1990, while radio,
television and communications equipment
output is up by about 51%. However, output
of medical and optical instruments fell by
6.5% during the 1990s, while that of electrical
machinery and apparatus has fallen by about
10%.

and administrative jobs) in these sectors, with
Scotland and Wales having become important
areas for inward investors. Scotland’s
electronics industry (‘Silicon Glen’—in reality
all of central Scotland) directly employs about
40,000 people. In 1998 electrical and
instrument engineering accounted for exports
worth £10 billion, 54% of Scotland’s
manufactured exports.
Many of the world’s leading electronics
firms have manufacturing plants in Britain.
IBM, Sony, Compaq, Panasonic, Toshiba,
NEC, Nortel, Seagate and Hewlett-Packard
are among overseas-based multinationals with
substantial manufacturing investment in the
UK. The main electronic consumer goods
produced are television sets (one-third of
television sets made in the EU come from the
UK). High-fidelity audio and video
equipment is also produced. British-
manufactured products have a worldwide
reputation as high-quality goods aimed at the
upper end of the market.
The computer industry in the UK is the
largest in Europe, producing an extensive
range of systems for all uses. For information
on software, see chapter 30, p. 529. The
multinational computer manufacturers in the
UK include IBM, Compaq and Sun. Other
companies, such as Psion (a pioneer of the
‘palmtop’ computer), have concentrated on
developing new lines for specialised markets.
A broad range of other electrical machinery
and apparatus is produced in the UK: power
plant, electric motors, generators,
transformers, switchgear, insulated wire and
cable, and lighting equipment. Rolls-Royce
Industrial Power Group produces highly
efficient aero-derivative gas turbines in
smaller applications. The UK is a world leader
in the manufacture of generating sets. In the
cables sector, AEI and Pirelli produce high-
voltage transmission cables and optical fibre
cables for telecommunications. TUG is the
UK’s largest manufacturer of lighting
products.
The past ten years have seen the
development of electronic service providers
(contract electronic manufacturers) which
manufacture and assemble products to the
specification of another company. This global
trend has encouraged some multinational
producers to move away from manufacture to
become solely designers, developers,
marketers or sellers of their products. The
UK is one of the leading locations in Europe
for this type of business. Industry giants like
SCI, Celestica, Solectron, AVEX, and Jabil
already have UK facilities.
Communications Equipment
The domestic telecommunications equipment
market is worth some £3.2 billion a year.
Manufacturers have been investing heavily in
facilities to meet the rapidly increasing
demand for telecommunications services (see
chapter 22). The main products are switching
and transmission equipment, telephones and
terminals. Marconi Communications is the
UK’s foremost telecommunications
manufacturer. It is now wholly owned by the
British GEC group. Its range includes PBXs
(private branch exchanges), payphones,
transmission systems and videoconferencing
equipment. Other prominent manufacturers
in the UK include Nortel and Alcatel.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification
data-carrying cables.
There has been remarkable growth in
mobile communications (see p. 378), where
the UK is among Europe’s leading markets
and manufacturing bases. The main
producers—Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson and
Lucent—all have UK production and design
centres. Fibre optics (invented in the UK) and
other optoelectronic components are also
experiencing rapid growth, where Hewlett-
Packard, Nortel, Pirelli and Corning have
considerable UK facilities.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging
systems, alarms and signalling apparatus,
public broadcasting equipment and other
capital goods. Radar was invented in the UK
and British firms are still in the forefront of
technological advances. Racal Avionics’ X-
band radar for aircraft ground movement
control is in use at airports in several overseas

countries. Solid-state secondary surveillance
radar, manufactured by Cossor Electronics, is
being supplied to numerous overseas civil
aviation operators.
Medical Electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the UK stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and
extensive clinical research and testing facilities
in the chemical, biological, physical and
molecular sciences. Important contributions
have been made by British scientists and
engineers to basic R&D in endoscopy, CT
(computerised tomography) scanning,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI—pioneered
in the UK), ultrasonic imaging, CADiagnosis
and renal analysis. UK medical electronic
firms—in total more than 1,000, employing
about 35,000 people—continue their tradition
of developing and manufacturing a range of
medical equipment for domestic and overseas
health sectors. Companies such as GEC and
Oxford Instruments produce, among other
things, ultrasound scanners, electromyography
systems and patient monitoring systems for
intensive and coronary care and other uses.
Other British-owned companies include
Invensys (created from the merger of BTR and
Siebe), Smith and Nephew and Smiths
Industries. About two-fifths of the medium to
large companies have a US or other overseas
parent.
Instrumentation and Control
A variety of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in the UK, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication materials, all for use in machine
tools. The instrument engineering industry
makes measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic items;
watches, clocks and other timing devices; and
medical surgical instruments. This sector has
annual exports of about £4 billion and a
positive trade balance of £910 million. Some
2,700 enterprises employ about 105,000
people.
Motor Vehicles
New car registrations increased by 3.5% in
1998 to 2.25 million, the second highest figure
on record. Car production, at 1.75 million,
was at its highest level since 1972. Output of
motor vehicles and components has risen by
about 16.5% since 1990. Vehicle
manufacturers are increasingly pursuing a
global market, with production no longer
dominated by their traditional home markets.
This is reflected in the rise in both UK
exports and imports of motor vehicles.
Exports (including components) were valued
at £16.2 billion in 1998. A total of 1.02 million
passenger cars were produced for export in
1998, well over twice as many as in 1990.
Commercial vehicle production in 1998 was
227,000, slightly down on the last few years;
103,000 units were for export. Production is
dominated by light commercial vehicles.
Around 810,000 jobs are dependent on the
UK automotive industry, including 222,000
engaged in vehicle and component production
and manufacturing activities. There are 490
motor vehicle manufacturers in the UK. Car
output is dominated by seven overseas groups,
accounting for 99% of the total: Rover (a
subsidiary of BMW), Ford (including Jaguar),

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
Vauxhall/IBC, Peugeot-Talbot, Honda,
Nissan and Toyota. The remainder is in the
hands of smaller, specialist producers such as
Rolls-Royce (now owned by Volkswagen),
whose cars are renowned for their quality and
durability.
Capital investment continues on a large
scale. Motor vehicle manufacturers invested
more than £3 billion in the UK in 1998. Since
their arrival in the mid-1980s, Nissan, Toyota
and Honda have invested substantial sums in
the UK, which is their main base for the
European market. All three are now producing
at least two models of car in the UK. A period
of major change has accompanied the arrival
of the three Japanese car manufacturers. Their
management approach, high productivity,
quality, workforce commitment and co¬
operative partnerships have had a positive
effect on established car and component
manufacturers alike. In the last decade UK
vehicle production per person has increased
by over 70%.
Rover Group ranges includes the highly
successful Land Rover four-wheel drive
vehicles and a full range of family cars. In
1998 Rolls-Royce began producing its first
totally new model for nearly 20 years—the
Silver Seraph—at its Crewe plant.
The main truck manufacturers are Leyland
Trucks and Volvo. Dennis, based in
Guildford, is also an important bus
manufacturer. British-based bus companies
achieve considerable sales in overseas markets.
London Taxis International has recently
launched a new version of the famous London
taxi.
The automotive components manufacturing
sector, with an annual turnover of £8 billion
and employing 100,000 in Great Britain, is a
major contributor to the UK motor industry.
There are 1,245 companies (some 91% of
them small and medium enterprises) involved,
many of which also supply other sectors.
Well-known British companies such as GKN,
Pilkington, Unipart, Automotive Products,
Invensys, Johnson Matthey and BBA have
large automotive plants, as do other
multinationals such as LucasVarity, Federal
Mogul, Valeo, Bosch and Johnson Controls.
In recent years the sector has enjoyed strong
growth and rising productivity.
Recent investments and announcements of
investment plans include Toyota’s £150
million at its engine plant in Deeside, raising
capacity to 400,000 engines a year; four Unipart
joint ventures totalling over £80 million;
Visteon’s £128 million on four facilities in the
UK; and Toyoda Gosei’s £32 million on a
Weatherstrips plant in Rotherham, Yorkshire
creating 400 jobs by 2002.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
The UK merchant shipbuilding industry,
located mainly in Scotland and northern
England, consists of 14 yards producing ships
ranging from fishing vessels to large specialist
craft for offshore exploration and exploitation
work. At the end of March 1999 the industry’s
order-book was for 28 ships. The merchant
ship repair and conversion industry, which has
a strong presence in the market for small to
medium-size craft, consists of 66 companies
employing between 4,000 and 8,000 people,
depending on activity levels. The turnover of
the sector amounted to some £300 million in
1998. The three warship building and three
refit and repair yards are looking to extend their
area of interest into the merchant vessel sector.
Together they employ about 17,000 people.
In addition, 455 firms are engaged in the
manufacture and repair of pleasure and
sporting boats. A few internationally known
builders dominate the sector. The UK marine
equipment industry has an annual turnover of
over £825 million and employs about 9,500
people. (Few companies, however, are totally
dedicated to marine equipment manufacture.)
It tends to concentrate around the former
major shipping and shipbuilding centres in
London, Southampton, Liverpool, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Glasgow and Belfast, and
production includes sophisticated navigational
and propulsion systems. About two-thirds of
output is exported.
Over 25 years of oil and gas exploitation in
the North Sea have generated a major offshore
industry (see p. 493). Shipbuilders and
fabricators build floating production storage
and offload vessels (FPSOs) and semi-
submersible units for drilling, production and
emergency/maintenance support; drill ships;
481
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
jack-up rigs; modules; and offshore loading
systems. Harland and Wolff of Belfast is a
world leader in the FPSO and drill ship fields.
UIE Scotland, Highlands Fabricators, John
Brown and McDermott Scotland are among
the larger contractors employed by the oil
operators for the design and manufacture of
jack-up oil rigs and semi-submersibles. Many
other firms supply equipment and services to
the offshore industry, notably diving expertise,
consultancy, design, project management and
R&D. A number have used their experience of
North Sea projects to establish themselves in
oil and gas markets throughout the world.
Railway Equipment
There are several hundred UK companies
engaged in the manufacture of railway
equipment for both domestic and overseas
markets, mainly producing specialist
components and systems for use in rolling
stock, signalling, track and infrastructure
applications. Three large multinational train
builders, Adtranz (German-owned), Alstom
(UK-French) and Bombardier (Canadian-
owned), have UK bases. British Steel Railway
Products is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers of steel rail.
Aerospace and Defence
The UK’s aerospace industry is one of only
three in the world with a complete capability
across the whole spectrum of aerospace.
Turnover in 1998 was about £17.3 billion, of
which approximately 67% was exported,
compared with £8.4 billion in 1987. The
industry contributed £1.6 billion to the UK’s
balance of payments in 1998. On a wider
definition of the aerospace industry, exports
are as much as £11.7 billion. Some 109,000
people are directly employed, with the North
West, South West and East Midlands
providing the highest number of jobs. The
biennial Farnborough International Exhibition
and Flying Display, organised by the Society
of British Aerospace Companies, is one of the
world’s premier airshows.
Among the leading companies are British
Aerospace (BAe), with turnover of over £7
billion in 1998, and Rolls-Royce, both of
which are among the UK’s top five exporters.
BAe produces both civil and military aircraft,
as well as aircraft components and guided
weapons, employing 43,000 people altogether.
At the end of 1998 its order book was £8.6
billion, of which £6.3 billion represented
defence-related orders.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, materials, flight controls including
‘fly-by-wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 484), materials, avionics and complex
components, with their associated services. In
order to improve fuel economy, engine and
airframe manufacturers use lighter materials
such as titanium and carbon-fibre composites,
combined with advanced avionics and
improved aerodynamic techniques.
The UK is the second largest defence
supplier after the United States. Exports were
estimated at £4.7 billion in 1998, and the
sector supports some 418,000 jobs.
Civil Aircraft
British Aerospace has a 20% share of the
European consortium Airbus Industrie, with

airliners, from the short- to medium-haul A320
series (the first civil airliner to use fly-by-wire
controls—see p. 484) to the large long-range
four- engined A340. Airbus and its related
businesses support 40,000 UK jobs and
contribute about £1.5 billion a year to the UK’s
balance of payments. In 1998 Airbus received
firm orders for 556 new aircraft worth a total of
US $39 billion from 36 customers around the
world, and in the first half of 1999 it had 65%
of the world market for large civil aircraft.
Airbus is planning to revise its structure, with
the intention of eventually becoming a single
corporate entity.
Short Brothers is owned by Bombardier
Inc. of Canada and employs about 6,500
people, mainly in Belfast. The company is
mostly engaged in the design and production
of major civil aircraft sub-assemblies,
advanced engine nacelles and components for
aerospace manufacturers as well as the
provision of aviation support services.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
Among British Aerospace’s military aircraft is
the Eurofighter Typhoon, the world’s most
advanced multi-role combat aircraft, built by
the British Aerospace, Daimler-Chrysler,
Alenia and CASA consortium. The company
also has the Harrier, a vertical/short take-off
and landing (V/STOL) military combat
aircraft, and the Tornado combat aircraft
(built jointly by British Aerospace, Alenia and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace). British Aerospace
is involved with Lockheed Martin of the
United States in the US Joint Strike Fighter
programme. It also produces the Hawk fast-jet
trainer, being supplied to 17 customers
worldwide.
British Aerospace is a major supplier of
tactical guided weapon systems for use on
land, at sea and in the air, having merged its
missile business with that of France’s Matra
Corporation to form Europe’s largest guided
weapons concern, Matra Bea Dynamics.
Shorts Missile Systems Ltd (SMS) is a joint
venture between Shorts and Thomson-CSF of
France in the area of very short-range air
defence systems.
Marconi Electronic Systems achieved sales of
£3.8 billion in 1997—98, with 65% representing
sales to customers outside the UK. The
company is prime contractor for the PHOENIX
unmanned aerial vehicle project and for the
Brimstone missile for the Eurofighter Typhoon,
the Tornado and the Harrier.
Helicopters
GKN-Westland Helicopters manufactures the
Sea King, Lynx and Apache military
helicopters, and, in partnership with Agusta of
Italy, the multi-role EH101 medium-lift
helicopter at its Somerset facilities. Over 1,000
Westland helicopters are in service in around
20 countries. GKN-Westland recently
announced a joint venture agreement with
Agusta.
Land Systems
The UK’s main armoured fighting vehicle
capability is concentrated in two companies:
V ickers Defence Systems and Alvis. Royal
Ordnance, owned by British Aerospace, is the
UK’s only indigenous ordnance company.
Engines and Other Aviation Equipment
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 1998 of £3.5 billion for its
aerospace business. More than 53,000 Rolls-
Royce engines are in service, one of the largest
fleets in the world. Over 1,000 RB211-535
engines are in service, and 80% of Boeing 757
operators have selected it. The company’s
latest large engine, the Trent, has achieved a
significant share of the world market for the
new generation of wide-body twin-engined
airliners, such as Boeing’s 777 and the Airbus
A330. Rolls-Royce is a partner in the four-
nation International Aero Engine consortium,
which manufactures the low-emission V2500
aero-engine, now in service on the Airbus
A320 and A321. Rolls-Royce produces
military engines for both fixed-wing aircraft
and helicopters, and is a partner in the EJ200
engine project for the Eurofighter and in the
US Joint Strike Fighter programme.
Manufacturers such as Dowty, Marconi
Electronic Systems, TRW (Lucas Aerospace),
483
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Smiths Industries, Racal, Meggitt, Cobham,
Hunting, Ultra, Normalair-Garrett and
British Aerospace provide equipment and
systems for engines, aircraft propellers,
navigation and landing systems, engine and
flight controls, environmental controls and
oxygen breathing and regulation systems,
electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck controls and information displays.
Marconi Electronic Systems is the world’s
largest manufacturer of head-up displays
(HUDs). British firms have made important
technological advances, for example, in
developing fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, where control surfaces on the
wings and elsewhere are moved by means of
automatic electronic signalling and fibre optics
respectively. UK companies provide radar and
air traffic control equipment and ground
power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide (see also p. 479).
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 organisations employing more than
6,000 people are engaged in industrial space
activities (see pp. 433-4), with annual
turnover now more than £700 million.
Through its participation in the European
Space Agency, the British National Space
Centre (see p. 433) has enabled UK-based
companies to participate in many leading
space projects covering telecommunications,
satellite navigation, Earth observation, space
science and astronomy. The industry is strong
in the development and manufacture of civil
and military communications satellites and
associated Earth stations and ground
infrastructure equipment. In the field of Earth
observation, it plays a major role in
manufacturing platforms, space radar and
meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is Matra
Marconi Space UK. Together with its French
partner, it is one of the world’s major space
companies. It has become the leading provider
of direct broadcast television satellites, and is
involved in nearly all of Europe’s space
science projects. Discussions on further
consolidation of the industry with the German
company Dornier and the Italian company
Alenia are continuing.
Other firms, such as EEV, Sira, Pilkington,
Com Dev, ERA and AEA Technology, supply
satellite subsystems, and IGG is Europe’s
leading procurer and tester of space qualified
components. UK companies such as Surrey
Satellite Technology and Space Innovations are
leaders in the field of micro and mini satellites,
which provide relatively quick and cheap access
to space. Major suppliers of satellite ground
stations and space software include Logica,
Science Systems, SEA and Vega.
Construction
The total value of work done in the UK
construction industry during 1998 was worth
£62 billion. The level of output for the year
grew by 2%, with the private commercial
sector accounting for a large share of this
growth. The main areas of construction work
within the UK industry are:
• building and civil engineering—ranging
from major private sector companies with
diverse international interests to one-
person enterprises carrying out domestic
repairs;
• specialist work—companies or individuals
undertaking construction work ranging
from structural steelwork and precast
concrete structures to mechanical and
electrical services (including the design
and installation of environmentally
friendly building control systems);
• the supply of building materials and
components—ranging from large
quarrying companies, and those engaged
in mass production of manufactured
items, to small, highly specialised
manufacturers; and
• consultancy work—companies or
individuals engaged in the planning,
design and supervision of construction
projects.
Some 1.1 million people were employed in
construction in 1998. Around 8% of all male
employee jobs are in the construction
industry, but the number of women working
in the industry is relatively low. A large

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
number—over 600,000—of people working
in construction are self-employed.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
Private and public sector projects are managed
in a variety of ways. Most clients invite
construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of project procurement
have become more common in recent years—
for example, contracts might include
subsequent provision of building maintenance,
or a comprehensive ‘design-and-build’ service
where a single company oversees every stage
of a project from conception to completion.
Financing of major projects has also been
changing. Traditionally, clients raised the
finance to pay for schemes themselves. Today,
they often demand a complete service package
which includes finance; as a result, larger
construction companies are developing closer
links with banks and other financial
institutions. In public sector construction the
Government’s Private Finance Initiative/
Public-Private Partnerships (see p. 403) have
also heralded a move away from traditional
financing.
Major Construction Projects in the UK
Major building schemes in hand or recently
completed include the express rail link from
central London to Heathrow Airport; the
London Underground Jubilee Line extension
connecting the centre of the capital with the
new commercial and residential areas in
London’s Docklands (see photographs
between pp. 484 and 485); the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 371); the M60
motorway in Manchester; the Millennium
Dome project (see p. ix), in the London
Borough of Greenwich; and development at
several major UK airports (see pp. 376-7).
The Channel Tunnel (see p. 370), which
opened to traffic in 1994, remains the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe. It is about 50 km (31
miles) long and 70 m (230 ft) below sea level at
its deepest. Associated projects included new
international stations at Waterloo in London
and Ashford (Kent), and an international
terminal at Folkestone (on the Kent coast).
In 1998, the public sector accounted for
40% of construction industry contracts in
the UK.
Housing
During 1998 there was a downturn in the
housing market, and the total value of new
housing orders in Great Britain was just under
£6 billion, 4% less than in 1997. In 1998
construction of some 189,250 dwellings was
started in the UK. Starts by private sector
concerns were 165,300, by housing
associations 23,500, and in the public sector
500. Around 179,000 dwellings were
completed: 153,600 by the private sector,
24,300 by housing associations and 1,000 by
the public sector.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
UK companies are engaged in major
undertakings throughout the world and have
been in the forefront of management
contracting and of‘design and build’
operations. Contractors and consultants
undertake the supervision and all or part of
the construction of a project.
British companies have a reputation for
integrity and independence. UK contractors
are active in over 100 countries. In 1997 they
won new international business valued at £4
billion. North America remains the most
valuable market, accounting for about 38% of
all new contracts. Important international
contracts won in 1998 include:
• Oakland International Airport, United
States;
• eight 37-storey apartment blocks in Hong
Kong;
• the design and construction of a major
pumping station in Egypt; and
• a power station in Hungary.
UK engineering consultants are engaged in
projects in 140 countries. In 1998 members of
485
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the Association of Consulting Engineers were
engaged in new programmes overseas with a
total value of £28 billion. The capital value of
projects under way at the end of 1998 was
£101.7 billion. UK consulting engineers had
estimated gross earnings in 1998 of £879
million from overseas commissions. The
largest categories of work covered include
structural/commercial; roads, bridges and
tunnels; railways, hydro-electric and water-
supply projects. The most important markets
were the Far East (although the value of
projects was lower than in 1997 as a result of
the region’s economic crisis), Africa, the EU,
the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.
Major new international projects include:
• airports in the United States;
• railways in Thailand and Hong Kong;
• structural/commercial work in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Poland;
• motorways in Australia and South Africa;
and
• thermal power stations in Hong Kong.
The Government has a role to play in
promoting the construction industry overseas,
offering advice and support for individual
companies. In 1998, nearly 100 companies
were involved in construction trade promotion
visits to Poland, the Philippines, Egypt and
Brazil.

UK energy production was up by 1.9% and primary energy demand by 1.4% in
1998. Production of petroleum increased by 3.2% to a new record level, while
production and consumption of gas rose by 5.0% and 3.9% respectively, mainly
because of further use of gas in electricity generation. In its determination to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to promote energy efficiency, the
Government has announced its intention to levy an energy tax on industry
from April 2001 and has set a target for renewables to provide 10% of the UK’s
electricity needs by 2010.
Great Britain has become the first country in the world to offer all of its 26
million electricity and gas customers (industrial, commercial and domestic)
the choice of which company supplies their energy.
Energy Resources
Production of coal continued to fall in 1998,
by 14.7% on 1997. However, production of
crude oil reached a record level, exceeding the
previous record set in 1995 by 2.1%. Nuclear
electricity output went up by 2%, also to
reach a record level. The increase in the
production of natural gas, a feature of recent
years, has been caused not only by the growing
demand for gas for electricity generation, but
also by significant exports to the Irish
Republic and to the rest of Europe, and by
falling imports. Coal still supplied a
considerable proportion of the country’s
primary energy needs: 33% of the electricity
supplied in 1998 was from coal, while gas
supplied 32.5% and nuclear 26%.
Provisional figures for 1998 show that, in
value terms, total imports of fuels were 29.8%
lower than in 1997, largely as a result of a
40.5% fall in the value of crude oil imports.
Exports were 28.3% lower, mainly because of
a 28.7% fall in the value of exports of crude oil
and petroleum products. Overall the UK
remains a net exporter of fuels, with a surplus
on a balance of payments basis of £3.4 billion
in 1998, £1.1 billion lower than in 1997 owing
to the impact of lower crude oil prices on the
international market. The surplus of crude oil
and petroleum products was £4.1 billion. In
volume terms, imports of fuel in 1998 were
487
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
4.5% lower than in 1997, while exports were
4% higher. The UK had a trade surplus in
fuels of 39.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent—
the sixth year in succession that the UK has
had a trade surplus in volume terms.
In 1900 coal was virtually the country’s
sole source of energy. In the 19th century
it gave the UK a unique advantage in
establishing and sustaining British
industrial leadership. In 1866 Chancellor
Gladstone had forecast that demand for
coal in Britain would reach 2,607 million
tons in 1960. Nearly two-thirds of all coal
entering world trade was mined in Britain,
whose exports were nearly a quarter of
output. In 1850 the mining labour force
was 200,000, a figure which was to peak in
1913 at over 1 million. Gas, produced by
the carbonisation of certain types of coal,
was used for lighting streets, public
buildings and the houses of the well-to-do,
although its domestic market was
extending to cooking and heating. In
1900—05 electricity was used for little more
than lighting.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy is to ensure
secure, diverse and sustainable supplies at
competitive prices. It is introducing major
reforms aimed at achieving more effective
competition in the electricity market to
provide a fair deal:
• for consumers, so that they have access to
energy at affordable prices;
• for producers and suppliers, so that the
market in which they operate does not
give unfair advantage; and
• for the environment.
In the 1999 Budget the Government
announced plans for an energy tax (‘climate
change levy’). It will come into force in April
2001 and be paid by energy suppliers who can
be expected to pass it on to industrial and
commercial customers. The tax is designed to
encourage businesses to use energy more
efficiently, cutting carbon emissions by an
estimated 1.5 million tonnes a year and
playing a significant role in meeting the
Government’s target under the Kyoto
Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by 12.5% by 2008-12.
Since June 1999 the Director General of
Electricity and Gas Supply has headed a new
energy regulatory body, the Office of Gas and
Electricity Markets (OFGEM). Many
electricity and gas companies now sell both
products in the liberalised markets. The
primary duty of the Director General has
shifted from the regulation of monopoly
suppliers to ensuring fair play in an
increasingly competitive market.
International Developments
Research, development and demonstration of
energy technologies in the European Union
(EU) are carried out within the Fifth
Framework Programme of Research and
Technological Development, which started in
1999 (see p. 434), with a non-nuclear budget
of £119 million a year. In November 1998 the
EU Energy Council adopted four main
components of the Energy Framework
programme: ETAP (shared studies and
analyses); SYNERGY (international co¬
operation); CARNOT (clean and efficient use
of solid fuels); and SURE (safe transport of
nuclear materials and safeguards). ALTENER
(renewable energy) and SAVE (energy
conservation) will continue, but as part of the
Energy Framework programme. Seventeen
agencies, which conduct research into, and
promote, energy conservation, have been
established in the UK under the SAVE II
programme, which usually provides up to
150,000 euros of start-up funding.
Changes in the Oil Stocks Directive, which
requires all EU member states to hold
contingency oil stocks, are to come into force
at the latest by January 2000. As an oil
exporter, the UK is eligible for a reduction in
its stocking obligation, which could save its oil
industry about £10 million a year.

industrialised countries and whose
membership consists of all OECD members
(see p. 414) except Iceland and Mexico.
In February 1999, 12 EU members were
required to open at least 26.5% of their
electricity supply markets to competition, and
all must reach at least 33% by 2003. (The
majority have, however, gone further: the
European Commission estimated that some
60% of EU power markets were open in
1999.) By May 1999 the electricity market in
Great Britain had been fully opened up, along
with the electricity markets of Finland,
Germany and Sweden. In August 2000, EU
member states are due to open at least 20% of
their gas supply markets, rising to 28% by
2003 and 33% by 2008. The UK gas market
has been fully open to competition since May
1998.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In 1998 consumption of primary fuels in the
UK was only 7.8% higher than in 1970,
despite an 85% increase in gross domestic
product (at constant market prices). Energy
consumption by final users in 1998 amounted
to 169 million tonnes of oil equivalent1 on an
‘energy supplied’ basis, of which transport
took 31.6%, industrial users 20.6%,
residential users 27.2%, commerce,
agriculture and public services 12.8% and
non-energy uses 7.7%.
11 tonne of oil equivalent = 41.868 gigajoules.
Primary energy demand was 1.4% higher
than in 1997, but 0.8% lower than in 1996.
Primary demand for coal was 0.8% higher
than in 1997; primary demand for oil fell by
0.8%; but gas rose by 3.9%, following marked
increases in 1995-97. On a temperature
corrected basis—which shows what the annual
intake might have been if the average
temperature during the year had been the
same as the average for 1961-90—energy
consumption grew by 1.5% in 1998, following
increases in every year since 1995.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Government funding on energy efficiency
programmes in the UK in 1998-99 was about
£109 million. They are an essential part of its
strategy for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions (see p. 337). It has been estimated
that by 2010, in the domestic sector, savings of
up to 6.5 million tonnes of carbon a year could
be achieved by improving the energy
efficiency of buildings. The potential
contribution of commercial and industrial
buildings could be 5 million tonnes and of
public sector buildings 1.1 million tonnes.
These savings correspond to a reduction of
15%-20% on the estimated carbon emissions
for 2010 for these sectors.

production managers in industry, and those

combined heat and power (CHP—see p. 498)
and community heating projects. Its target is
savings of £800 million a year (at 1990 prices)
by the end of 2000, or about 5 million tonnes
of carbon, and it is currently saving about
£650 million (about 3.25 million tonnes).
The Energy Saving Trust (EST)
concentrates on domestic consumers and small
and medium-sized enterprises. It received
government funding of £19 million in
1998- 99. In that year the EST’s programmes
attracted a further £28 million of funding
from industry and local authorities towards
the programmes run for the Department of
the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
Up to the end of 1998-99 more than 250,000
installations of energy saving measures, such
as central heating controls, condensing boilers,
cavity wall insulation, high-frequency lighting
and small-scale CHP, had been made and
advice given to some 660,000 individuals and
organisations.
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES), with a budget of £75 million in
1999- 2000, gave insulation grants worth up to
£315 to 400,000 low-income, disabled or
elderly householders in 1998—99, thus
reducing household fuel costs by up to £100
million a year. Its role and operation were
included in the Government’s review of fuel
poverty policy.
The Government’s Market Transformation
programme promotes domestic equipment
which does less harm to the environment,
particularly by using less energy. It seeks to
cut back on 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
(C02) by 2010. Energy labels are mandatory
for fridges, washing machines, washer/dryers
and tumble dryers, dishwashers and light
bulbs.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
Oil and gas are the most important natural
resources to be discovered in the UK in the
20th century. The occurrence of vast amounts
of oil and gas, in particular beneath the North
Sea and the Irish Sea, is a result of a
remarkable set of geologic circumstances
involving the deposition and maturing of an
oil-rich source rock, the timely migration of
oil and gas into porous reservoir rocks and
their containment in these reservoirs beneath
impermeable seals. The result has been
diverse major oil and gas provinces around the
UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). In 1998,
output of crude oil and natural gas liquids
(NGLs) in the UK averaged over 2.7 million
barrels (about 363,350 tonnes) a day, making it
the world’s ninth largest producer. Despite
the longevity of the UKCS as a petroleum
province (onshore oil was first discovered in
1919 and the first major offshore find was
made in 1967), there is still potential in both
mature and frontier areas.
Taxation
The Government grants licences to private
sector companies to explore for and exploit oil
and gas resources (see below). Its main sources
of revenue from oil and gas activities are
petroleum revenue tax (see p. 407), levied on
profits from fields approved before 16 March
1993; corporation tax, charged on the profits
of oil and gas companies—the only tax on
profits from fields approved after 15 March
1993; and royalty, which applies only to fields
approved before April 1982 and is paid at
12.5% of the value of petroleum ‘won and
saved’.
Licensing
The 18th seaward licensing round since 1964
was completed in December 1998, when 47
licences were awarded covering 78 blocks in
the North Sea—some on fallow blocks
relinquished by previous licensees; others in
hitherto unexplored areas. By the end of 1998,
6,935 wells had been, or were being, drilled in
the UKCS: 2,058 exploration wells, 1,239
appraisal wells and 3,638 development wells.
The Government must approve all proposed
wells and development plans.
Production and Reserves
A record 204 offshore fields were in
production in March 1999: 109 oil, 79 gas and
16 condensate (a lighter form of oil).
Production started at 12 new offshore oilfields

during 1998, and 24 new development
projects were approved. Offshore, these
comprised ten oilfields and eight gasfields;
onshore, two gasfields and four oilfields. In
addition, approval for 14 incremental offshore
developments (elaborations to existing fields)
and one onshore was granted.
Cumulative UKCS stabilised crude oil
production to end-1998 was 2,202 million
tonnes. The fields with the largest production
totals are Forties, Brent, Ninian and Piper.
Britain’s largest onshore oilfield, at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), produces 84.4% of the total
crude oils and NGLs originating onshore.
Possible maximum remaining UKCS reserves
of oil are estimated at 1,800 million tonnes.
Offshore Gas
Natural gas now accounts for 38% of total
inland primary fuel consumption in the UK.
In 1998 indigenous production amounted to a
record 95,503 million cubic metres.
Production from the three most prolific
offshore gasfields, Leman, Indefatigable and
the Hewett area, has accounted for 38% of the
total gas produced so far in the UKCS.

System (FLAGS) and from the Scottish Area

additional contributions. The Southern Basin
fields and the South Morecambe field in the
Irish Sea produce more gas in winter to satisfy
increased demand, with the North Sean and
South Sean fields also augmenting supplies to
meet peak demand on very cold days in
winter. The partially depleted Rough field is
used as a gas store for rapid recovery during
peak winter periods (see map opposite p. 420).
Cumulative gas production to end-1998 is
1.38 million million cubic metres. Maximum
possible remaining gas reserves in present
discoveries now stand at 1.8 million million
cubic metres.
Pipelines
Some 9,435 km (5,863 miles) of major
submarine pipelines transport oil, gas and
condensate from one field to another and to
shore.
Six terminals on the North Sea coast bring
gas ashore to supply a national and regional
high- and low-pressure pipeline system some
273,000 km (170,625 miles) long, which
transports natural gas around Great Britain.
Since 1996 a pipeline (40.4 km; 25 miles) has
taken natural gas from Scotland to Northern
Ireland; exports to the Irish Republic are
conveyed by the Britain-Ireland
interconnector. The pipeline (232 km; 145
miles) from Bacton to Zeebrugge in Belgium,
opened in 1998 and costing £420 million, has a
capacity of 20,000 million cubic metres a year.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Economic and Industrial Aspects
Oil prices fell sharply at the end of 1997,
mainly because of the economic crisis in the
Far East (combined with unseasonable mild
weather in the Northern Hemisphere), and hit
a 50-year low in real terms in December 1998.
The average oil price received by producers
from sales of UKCS oil was just under £60 a
tonne, compared with £87 a tonne in 1997. In
1998 UKCS oil and gas production accounted
for 1.7% of the UK’s gross value added. Total
revenues from the sale of oil (including
NGLs) produced from the UKCS in 1998 fell
to £8 billion, while those from the sale of gas
rose slightly to £5.3 billion. Taxes and royalty
receipts attributable to UKCS oil and gas fell
to £2.6 billion in 1998-99.
The Oil and Gas Task Force, set up by the
Government, with industry support, in
November 1998, is developing strategies to
enable the UK offshore industry to remain
competitive under low international oil prices.
Since 1965 the oil and gas production
industry has generated operating surpluses
of some £237 billion, of which over £102
billion (including £23 billion of
exploration and appraisal expenditure) has
been reinvested in the industry, £89
billion paid in taxation, and about £46
billion left for disposal by the companies.
However, total income of the oil and gas
sector fell from £19 billion in 1997 to some
£17 billion in 1998.
Production investment in the oil and gas
extraction industry rose to some £5.1 billion
in 1998. Including exploration and appraisal it
formed about 17% of total British industrial
investment and just over 4% of gross fixed
capital investment. Some 28,400 people were
employed offshore by the industry (which also
supports about a third of a million jobs in
related sectors) in 1998.
The Offshore Environment
Environmental assessment regulations
introduced in 1998 aim to increase protection
of the offshore environment and allow the
public greater access to information. In 1999
regulations implementing a 1997 EC Directive
were introduced, which require certain
activities to be subject to an environmental
impact assessment. In March 1999 the
Government published a consultation paper
seeking views on how its offshore
environmental regime could be further
improved.
During 1998 over 300 hours of
unannounced aerial surveillance of oil and gas
rigs detected minimal amounts of oil on the
surface of the sea. Between April 1998 and
March 1999, 57 offshore environmental
inspections were carried out. The 1998 figure
for accidental oil spills (137 tonnes) was
significantly lower than that for 1997 (866
tonnes).
The Petroleum Act 1998 places a
decommissioning obligation on the co¬
venturers of every offshore installation and the
owners of every offshore pipeline on the
UKCS. Companies have to submit a
programme for ministerial approval and
ensure that its provisions are carried out. In
1998 the OSPAR Commission (see p. 334)
agreed rules for the disposal of offshore
installations at sea. Dumping or leaving
offshore installations wholly or partly in place
is now prohibited, and the topsides of all
installations must be returned to shore, for
recycling or re-use. The presumption is in
favour of land disposal and all installations
with a jacket weight of less than 10,000 tonnes
must go back to shore. Rare exceptions to the
main rule will make allowances for the
footings of large steel jackets above 10,000
tonnes and concrete installations, whose cases
are to be considered individually. All
installations put in place after 9 February 1999
must be completely removed.
The topsides of Shell’s Brent Spar storage
and loading buoy are being recycled. The hull
sections are being used to build a ferry quay at
Mekjarvik in Norway, due for completion at
the end of 1999.

Suppliers of Goods and Services
The Infrastructure and Energy Projects
Directorate (IEP) within the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) is responsible for
helping UK-based contractors and suppliers to
win as high a share as possible of the provision
of goods and services to the oil, gas and
petrochemicals industry—a worldwide market
estimated to be worth ^200 billion a year.
The competitiveness of UK engineering
designers, fabricators and local supply chains
has enabled them to win an average 70% of
the goods and services needed for recent
development projects on the UKCS. The
lEP’s Target Market group focuses on 12
markets, including Brazil, Angola, Nigeria,
Qatar, China and Norway.
DOWNSTREAM OIL
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1998 included 21.8 million
tonnes of petrol for motors, 15.1 million
tonnes of DERV (diesel-engined road
vehicles) fuel, 9.2 million tonnes of aviation
turbine fuel, 7.3 million tonnes of gas oil
(distilled from petroleum) and 2.9 million
tonnes of fuel oils (blends of heavy
petroleum).
Oil Refineries
In 1998 the UK’s 14 refineries processed 93.6
million tonnes of crude and process oils.
About 80% of output by weight is in the form
of lighter, higher-value products, such as
gasoline, DERV and jet kerosene. The UK is
much more geared towards petrol production
than its European counterparts—about a third
of each barrel of crude oil, compared with a
European average of just over a fifth.
Trade
In 1998, the UK exported 24.2 million tonnes
of refined petroleum products, worth £2,328
million. Virtually all exports went to its
partners in the EU and in the International
Energy Agency, especially France and
Germany, and the United States.
Some 2,965 million cubic metres of UKCS
gas were exported in 1998. Most went to the
Netherlands, from the British share of the
Markham transboundary field and
neighbouring Windermere, and to the Irish
Republic. However, from October 1998 there
were some exports to Belgium through the
UK-Belgium interconnector. About 993
million cubic metres were imported from
Norway, representing 1.1% of total supplies
in 1998, compared with 1.5% in 1997.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The holder of a public gas transporter’s
licence may not also hold licences for supply
or shipping in a fully competitive market.3
British Gas, the former monopoly supplier to
customers taking less than 2,500 therms a
year, demerged in 1997 into two entirely
separate companies. The supply business is
now part of the holding company Centrica pic
(which still trades under the British Gas brand
name in the UK), while the pipeline and
storage businesses, most exploration and
production, and R&D have been retained
within British Gas pic, renamed BG pic.
The national and regional gas pipeline
network is owned by Transco, part of BG pic,
which retains responsibility for dealing with
leaks and emergencies, and also has a current
monopoly in gas metering, which the energy
regulator (see p. 488) plans to open to
competition. In 1999 the Government also
announced various arrangements to make gas
trading more competitive, after problems in
3 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas
transporters (PGTs) operate the pipeline system through
which gas will normally be delivered; shippers arrange with
PGTs for appropriate amounts of gas to go through the
pipeline system.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
1997 in balancing gas supply and demand,
which led to an increase in the costs borne by-
shippers:
• the removal of Transco’s monopoly over
the flexibility mechanism that ensures
supply always matches customers’
demands;
• the introduction of an independently
managed screen-based market, to reduce
Transco’s residual market balancing role;
• no more regulation of the prices charged
by BG Storage at its Rough (see p. 491)
and Hornsea facilities, to enable BG to
auction its underground gas storage; and
• separating Transco into three businesses
(transportation, providing and
maintaining meters, and meter reading).
Competition
Since 1994 independent suppliers have
captured 75% of the industrial and
commercial gas market. By May 1999 over 4.5
million (out of 20 million) domestic customers
had changed their gas supplier, switching
from British Gas, which still has about 80% of
the market, to one of the 26 other companies
now in it, and also between these companies.
In 1998 the changes were estimated to have
brought each standard credit customer average
savings of £56 a year on an annual bill of
about £320.
Only companies which have been granted a
supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas. The
licence carries various conditions, which
include providing gas to anyone in the licence
area who requests it and is connected to the
mains gas supply. Special services must be
made available for elderly, disabled and
chronically sick people. Suppliers must offer
customers a range of payment options; they
are able to set their own charges, but have to
publish their prices and other terms so that
customers can make an informed choice.
The Director General of Electricity and
Gas Supply (see p. 488) has powers to set
price controls for British Gas Trading and
Transco, to set and enforce standards of
performance, and to see that competitive
practices continue.
Consumption
Natural gas consumption, at an estimated
1,006 terawatt4 hours (TWh) in 1998, was up
nearly 4% on 1997, with gas supplied for
electricity generation (amounting to 258
TWh) up 6%. Sales to industry (176 TWh)
were 3.8% up and to the commercial sector
(118 TWh) 0.8% up, while domestic sales
(356 TWh) were 3.0% up. There has been a
steady fall in gas prices since 1982. In 1998
industrial gas prices were the lowest among
the EU countries. Between 1988 and 1998
average industrial gas prices fell by 51% in
real terms; domestic prices were reduced by
19% (including VAT). In Great Britain a
typical standard credit household’s annual gas
bill fell in real terms from £350 in 1988 to
£290 in 1998.
COAL
The UK coal industry is entirely in the private
sector. The main deep-mine operators in the
UK are RJB Mining pic (in England); Mining
(Scotland) Ltd; and Betws and Tower (a pit at
Hirwaun in Rhondda, Cynon and Taff, sold in
1996 to a ‘buy-out’ team of former
employees). RJB Mining, Mining (Scotland)
Ltd and Celtic Energy, which operates in
Wales, are the main opencast operators. In
spring 1999 there were 41 underground mines
in production, including 19 major deep mines,
employing some 10,500 workers and 59
opencast sites, owned by various companies
throughout the UK, employing about 4,000.
Opencast accounts for most of the relatively
low sulphur coal mined in Scotland and south
Wales, and contributes towards improving the
average quality and cost of coal supplies.
Government policy guidance for opencast
coal-mining, published in 1999, puts concern
for communities and the environment at the
heart of decision-making on new
developments. Planning authorities must
subject all proposals to tough scrutiny; if
consent is granted, the highest environmental
standards will apply.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Market for Coal
The UK produces the lowest-cost deep-mined
coal in the EU. In 1998 inland consumption of
coal was about the same as in 1997, at 63
million tonnes, of which 77% was used by the
electricity generators, 14% by coke ovens and
blast furnaces, 1% by other fuel producers,
4% by industry and 3% by domestic
consumers. Exports were 944,000 tonnes,
while imports amounted to 21 million
tonnes—mainly of steam coal for electricity
generation and coking coal. Total production
from British deep mines fell by 17%, from
30.3 million tonnes in 1997 to 25.0 million
tonnes in 1998. Opencast output fell by 10%
to 15.0 million tonnes.
In 1998 the five-year concessionary
contracts struck in 1993 before privatisation
between the then nationalised industry and
the three principal coal-fired generators
ended. In December, Eastern Group, the
third largest fossil fuel electricity generator,
agreed to buy an additional 28 million tonnes
of coal, worth £800 million, from RJB Mining
during 1999-2009, to bring its total purchases
for the period to almost 50 million tonnes
(j£l-4 billion). PowerGen, the second largest
fossil fuel generator, agreed to buy 35 million
tonnes (worth £1 billion) during 1999-2003.
These orders go some way towards replacing
the 1993 contracts.
The Government insists on a fair single
market for coal in Europe, in which UK
coal can compete on level terms with other
producers. It has challenged both the
European Commission and the
governments concerned on unfairly
subsidised competition from other
European countries and considers that the
ensuing market distortion has to be
removed quickly if it is not to do lasting
damage to UK producers.
Midlands Mining has announced the
closure at the end of 1999 of Britain’s
oldest colliery, Annesley-Bentinck in
Ashfield (Nottinghamshire), started in
1865. This will leave four deep mines
operating in the East Midlands, compared
with 50 when the industrv was nationalised
in 1947.
Clean Coal
Cleaner coal technologies reduce the
environmental impact of coal used for power
and industrial applications by increasing the
efficiency of converting it to energy and
reducing harmful emissions of particulates,
oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, the cause of
acid rain. Improvements in the efficiency of
coal-fired power stations lead directly to
reductions of C02, a major contributor to
climate change. The DTI contribution of £12
million over three years to the cleaner coal
R&D programme aims to encourage
collaboration between UK industry and
universities in the development of the
technologies and expertise. It expects that the
programme will give rise to projects worth
over £60 million in R&D.
The Coal Authority
The Coal Authority licenses coal-mining;
holds, manages and disposes of interests in
unworked coal and mines; provides
information about mining plans and geological
data; and deals with subsidence damage claims
and pollution to groundwater arising from
former coal-mining.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
In December 1998, 71 companies held
generation licences in England and Wales, of
which the principal ones are National Power,
PowerGen, Eastern Group, British Energy,
and the publicly owned Magnox Electric.
They sell electricity to suppliers through a
marketing mechanism known as the ‘Pool’.
The National Grid (NGC) owns and operates
the transmission system, and is responsible for
calling up generation plant to meet demand.
Distribution—transfer of electricity from
the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) in England and
Wales. Supply—the purchase of electricity
from generators and its sale to consumers—is
fully open to competition; since June 1999 all
consumers in Great Britain, including
495
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
22 million homes and 2 million small
businesses, have been able to choose from
whom they can buy electricity.
Eight of the 12 RECs are owned by
overseas companies. With British Energy’s
acquisition of SWALEC’s supply businesses,
all the main UK generators are being vertically
integrated through ownership of supply
businesses. British electricity companies
continue to invest overseas. In December
1998, for example, the NGC bought the New
England Electricity System in the United
States for £2.7 billion.
Reform of Electricity Trading
The Government’s Energy White Paper of
October 1998 detailed action to remove
distortions in the electricity market and
introduce more competitive trading
arrangements which do not feature a
compulsory Pool. Key points of its
programme included:
• divestment by the major generators, to
ensure competition in, and more
intensive use of, coal-fired flexible plant;
• radical overhaul of the Pool to ensure
keen prices;
• full competition among supply
companies;
• separating supply and distribution in
electricity markets;
• resolving technical issues about the
growth of gas, including the proper
remuneration of flexible plant; and
• continuing to press for open energy
markets in Europe.
Subject to time being available, it is hoped
that Parliament will enact a Utilities Bill,
which will allow the improved market to
function, in autumn 2000.
Electricity suppliers have also been asked
by the Government to improve the ways in
which they treat poor and indebted customers,
by, for example, reducing the gaps between
tariffs for the better-off (generally those who
pay by direct debit, which costs less) and the
poor (those on pre-payment meters or who do
not have bank accounts).
Scotland
ScottishPower pic and Scottish and Southern
Energy pic generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity within their respective
franchise areas. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from British Energy’s two
Scottish nuclear power stations (Hunterston B
and Torness), until 2005. The over-100-kWh
market in Scotland comprises about 6,750
customers and accounted for about 45% of all
electricity consumed. ScottishPower and
Scottish and Southern Energy have second-
tier licences which allow them to compete in
each other’s area. Some customers choose to
buy their electricity from the competing
Scottish public electricity supplier. In
1998-99, 18% of customers in the over-100-
kWh market obtained their power from
holders of second-tier supply licences.
OFGEM has asked generators, suppliers and
customers to submit views on the future of
Scotland’s power-trading arrangements.
Northern Ireland
Three private companies, Nigen, Premier
Power and Coolkeeragh Power, generate
electricity from four power stations. They are
obliged to sell to Northern Ireland Electricity
pic (NIE), which has a monopoly of
transmission and distribution, and a right to
supply. Supply to all customers is open to
competition, but the small scale and relative
isolation of a system in which consumers pay
an average 20% more for electricity than their
counterparts in Great Britain, have prevented
the introduction of competitive energy
trading. Implementation of the EC Electricity
Directive in February 1999 has provided the
largest consumers, who comprise 25% of the
total market, with the chance to contract
directly with independent power producers.
The Province has a power surplus, with a
peak demand of 1,500 MWh. The energy
regulator for Northern Ireland combines
responsibilities for electricity and gas.
Regulation and Other Functions
Regulation of the industry in Great Britain is
primarily the responsibility of the Director
496
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
General of Electricity and Gas Supply (see
p. 488). The Electricity Association is the
principal trade body for the industry. It carries
out representative and co-ordinating functions
for all the major companies and has a number
of overseas members.
Among companies operating in more than
one market is ScottishPower, Britain’s
largest utility, which has electricity, gas,
water and telecommunications interests.
British Gas claims 1.5 million electricity
customers. Eastern Electricity is the
second largest seller of gas to the domestic
market. Affinity deals include Alliance &
Leicester’s joint venture with London
Electricity, offering new home loan
borrowers up to three years’ free gas and
electricity.

Consumption
In 1998 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in the UK amounted to
305 TWh. Domestic users took 36% of the
total, industry 30%, and commercial and
other users the remainder.
In 1998 the average industrial electricity
price was lower in real terms than for any year
since 1970. UK prices have fallen in real terms
by 23% for domestic customers and by 28%
for large industrial users since privatisation in
1990. In 1998 an annual electricity bill for a
typical household was £275. Average UK
domestic electricity prices, including taxes, in
1998 were the fifth lowest within the EU and
industrial prices the eighth lowest.
Generation
The shares of generating capacity during
1997-99 are shown in Table 29.3.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the
UK’s major power producers consumed 50.6
million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1998, of
which coal accounted for 57%, natural gas
40% and oil and hydro 3%. Other power
companies (for which gas is the most widely
used fuel), and an increasing number of small
autogenerators (which produce power for their
own use), have equal access with the major
generators to the grid transmission and local
distribution systems. A ten-year programme
to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) through the installation of low-NOx
burners at 12 major power stations in England
and Wales is in progress. ScottishPower has
fitted low-NOx burners at Longannet power
station.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
In 1998, CCGT stations accounted for 28% of
the electricity generated by major power
producers, compared with 7% in 1993. This
increase has been balanced by a fall in coal-
and oil-fired generation. CCGT stations,
favoured by the smaller, independent
producers and using natural gas, offer cheap
generation, and give out almost no sulphur
dioxide and some 55% less C02 than coal-
fired plant per unit of electricity. At the end of
March 1999, 22 such stations in the UK (with
a total registered capacity of 15.6 GW) were
generating power. Although new natural gas-
fired generation would normally be
inconsistent with the Government’s energy
policy relating to diversity and security of
supply, the Energy White Paper of 1998
indicated that certain types of generating
station may have benefits that outweigh

government concerns. It has therefore raised
no objections to a new 500 MW CCG1
station at Baglan Bay in south Wales because
of its positive impact on employment and
economic regeneration.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are
designed to produce both electricity and
usable heat. They can be up to three times
more efficient than conventional generation,
because they retain and utilise the heat
produced in the generating process, rather
than discarding it, as conventional generation
does. This benefits the environment by
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. CHP
is also used for cooling and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy
sources. It offers particular benefits in
applications where there is a regular need for
heat as well as electricity—such as hospitals,
leisure centres and housing developments
and can be provided on a local scale. In 1998
over 1,300 CHP schemes supplied 4,000 MW
of generating capacity, 6% of the UK’s total
electricity (and 15% of that used by industry),
with 400 schemes under construction; the
Government is considering an increased target
of 10,000 MW by 2010. EU strategy is to
double CHP’s share of the electricity market
from 9% to 18% by the same year.
Trade
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000 MW cross-Channel cable link, allowing
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply ‘baseload’ power—which needs to be
generated and available round the clock
from France to England. Imports met about
4% of the UK’s electricity needs in 1998.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of under
6 GW and generating capacity of over 9 GW.
This additional available capacity (see p. 496) is
used to supply England and Wales through
transmission lines linking the Scottish and
English grid systems. This interconnector’s
capacity is now 1,600 MW, with plans to increase
it to 2,200 MW. NIE and ScottishPower have
put out to tender the construction of a 60-km
(37.5-mile) 250 MW undersea interconnector,
costing £150 million, to supply electricity to the
Northern Ireland system.
Nuclear Power
Nuclear power generates about one-sixth of
the world’s energy and over a third of
498
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Europe’s, the world’s largest market. It
substantially reduces the use of fossil fuels
which would otherwise be needed for
generation—in the UK by over 30% in 1998.
Such an amount would cause annual emissions
of up to 20.5 million tonnes of C02. In the EU
as a whole the amount avoided is some 700
million tonnes. However, public concern
about the disposal of spent fuel and nuclear
safety has proved a deterring factor. There are
currently no plans to build new nuclear power
generation plants in the UK or in France,
while Germany and Sweden plan to phase out
nuclear power investment; and Belgium and
Spain have imposed moratoriums on building
new nuclear stations. Worldwide only 30
nuclear stations were being built at the end of
1998, under 1% of global nuclear capacity.
The privatised nuclear industry in Great
Britain is run by British Energy pic, which
owns and operates advanced gas-cooled
reactors (AGRs) at seven power stations and
the pressurised water reactor (PWR) at
Sizewell B. The British nuclear power
generation industry achieved record output of
91 TWh in 1998, as well as contributing, at
30%, its highest ever proportion of total
electricity generation. British Energy’s reactors
have an aggregate capacity of 7,200 MW in
England and about 2,400 MW in Scotland,
where electricity needs are also met by hydro,
coal, oil, gas and new renewables, which, with
nuclear have a total output capacity of
approximately 9,300 MW. In Scotland, all
British Energy’s output is sold to
ScottishPower (74.9%) and to Scottish and
Southern Energy.
A segregated fund was established on the
privatisation of British Energy, with a £228
million initial endowment from it, to cover the
eventual cost of decommissioning its reactors.
British Energy contributes a further £16
million a year. British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL;
see below) and Magnox Electric, which
merged in 1999, operate eight magnox power
stations, together with a further three magnox
stations that are being decommissioned. The
Government has undertaken to pay BNFL
£3.7 billion to decommission reactors in the
21st century.
The Fossil Fuel Levy Act 1998 ensures
that nuclear electricity from licensed
suppliers, or imported from France, is subject
to the fossil fuel levy (see p. 500).
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
BNFL is Britain’s primary provider of nuclear
products and services to both UK and
international customers. It currently operates
in 17 countries, employs about 20,000 people
and has some £15 billion in future orders. It is
a public limited company, wholly owned by
the Government, which has announced the
introduction into it of a Public-Private
Partnership (see p. 403).
BNFL has also strengthened its reactor
services and fuel manufacture operations with
the purchase of Westinghouse in the United
States. A recent government announcement
means that uranium commissioning of BNFL’s
Mixed Oxide fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield
may commence while a further consultation on
the economic case for the plant is carried out.
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
UKAEA’s main function is to maintain and
decommission safely and cost-effectively its
redundant nuclear facilities used for the UK’s
nuclear R&D programme. UKAEA owns the
sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Culham and
Harwell (Oxfordshire), Windscale (Cumbria)
and Winfrith (Dorset), and is also responsible
for Britain’s fusion programme (see below).
Nuclear Research
Nuclear fusion in the UK is funded by the
DTI and Euratom (75% and 25%
respectively). The Government spends £15
million a year on fusion research, of which the
main focus is magnetic confinement, based at
Culham, where Britain’s own nuclear fusion
research is carried out. The UK is also a
partner in the experimental EU JET (Joint
European Torus) project, also at Culham,
extended to the end of 1999, and, through the
EU, of the proposed ITER (International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), which
aims to show the scientific and technological
feasibility of power production from fusion
energy for peaceful purposes.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Nuclear Safety
Responsibility for ensuring the safety of
nuclear installations falls to nuclear operators
within a system of regulatory control enforced
by the HSE.
The international Convention on Nuclear
Safety, in force since 1996, has been ratified
by 46 countries, including the UK, and each
has reported on how it has progressed towards
meeting its nuclear safety obligations. The
UK’s main contribution to the international
effort to improve safety in Central and Eastern
Europe and in the former Soviet republics is
channelled through the EU PHARE and
TACIS nuclear safety programmes.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES
OF ENERGY
In March 1999 the Government published a
White Paper on the future of renewable
energy, reaffirming its commitment to
developing it and increasing expenditure on
R&D to £43.5 million during 1999-2002.
Renewables are essential to the UK’s climate
change programme and play a vital role in
enabling it to meet its environmental targets of
reducing greenhouse gases by 12.5% by 2012
and C02 emissions by 20% by 2010. The
Government’s aim is for renewable energy to
provide 10% of UK electricity supplies by
2010. Over 700 British companies are involved
in renewables, directly employing some 3,500
people. The White Paper states that, if the
contribution of renewables to energy supply in
Europe were to double from the current 6% to
12% by 2010, it would create at least 500,000
jobs. UK renewables exports are estimated to
have risen from £10-£15 million a year in the
early 1990s to about £80-£100 million in
1998_99. The Government’s new and
renewable energy R&D programme covers
biofuels (including wastes), fuel cells, hydro,
solar and wind. These accounted for 2% of all
electricity generating capacity in Britain in
1998; natural flow hydro schemes provided
about three-quarters of this total.
The main government support measure for
the commercialisation of renewables is the
non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO),which
requires each public electricity supplier (PES)
Three photovoltaics (PV) initiatives
announced in 1999 and receiving £5
million in government support include a
field trial for at least 100 houses to test PV
installations under actual conditions and a
scheme demonstrating the use of PV in
large-scale building applications. To date,
119 landfill gas (mostly methane) schemes
have been commissioned under the
NFFO, the SRO (see p. 501) and in
Northern Ireland with a total capacity of
over 230 MW. Ecotricity, a joint venture
between the Renewable Energy Company
and Thames Water, is a green tariff which
aims to offer consumers electricity from
sewage gas, waste to energy, landfill gas,
hydro, solar and wind power, at market
prices. The UK’s first significant power
station to be fuelled by specially grown
willow and agricultural and forestry wastes
is under construction at Eggborough
(West Yorkshire) and will be capable of
generating 8 MW of electricity, enough to
power about 8,000 homes. Eastern
Electricity, the UK’s biggest power
supplier, with more than 3 million
customers in eastern England, allows them
to pay a 5%-10% supplement under its
Ecopower scheme which goes towards
supporting generation from renewable
energy. These contributions are matched
pound for pound by Eastern. Britain’s first
solar-powered pub, the Jolly Gardener at
Wandsworth (south-west London), is
fitted with solar panels, energy-efficient
glass and terrace lights fuelled by PV cells.
Britain’s first offshore wind farm is
currently being developed 1 km off the
coast at Blyth (Northumberland), under
NFFO-4 and an EU THERMIE grant,
and will generate up to 4 MW, enough to
satisfy 4,000 homes.
to reserve capacity for a certain amount of
electricity to be generated from non-fossil and
non-nuclear sources. PESs must then buy
renewables-sourced power at a premium price,
above the market price for conventionally
generated electricity, and are reimbursed the
difference through the fossil fuel levy, which
is paid by all electricity consumers through
500
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
their bills. Since 1990 the NFFO has provided
over £600 million of support for renewables.
(In Scotland the term Scottish Renewables
Obligation—SRO—is used.)
Five Renewables Orders have been made
for England and Wales, three for Scotland and
two for Northern Ireland. At 31 March 1999,
933 projects had been contracted under these
Orders, with a net capacity of 3,639 MW; 261
of these were ‘live’ and generating 677 MW.
The cost of renewable energy under successive
Orders has fallen significantly—from 6.4
pence a kilowatt hour under NFFO-1 to an
average 2.73 p/kWh under NFFO-5.
Interest in wave energy has been boosted by
its inclusion in SRO-3, and the DTI intends to
include new work on wave energy technology
in its new and renewable energy programme.
North Atlantic waves pound much of Britain’s
shoreline, a significant part of a theoretical
resource of about 50 TWh of electricity. There
are at present about 700 onshore wind turbines
in Britain, mostly in Wales and south-west
England, producing 330 MW.
Non-energy Minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 1997 came
to 312 million tonnes, valued at £2,355
million. The total number of employees in the
extractive industry was about 27,000.
The UK is virtually self-sufficient in
construction minerals, and produces and
exports several industrial minerals, notably
china clay, ball clay, potash and salt. The
Boulby potash mine in north-east England is
the UK’s most important non-energy mineral
operation. Production in 1997 was down from
a record 1.03 million tonnes in 1996 to
941,000 tonnes in 1997, of which 53% was
exported. Sales of china clay (or kaolin), the
largest export, increased by 3.4% to £243
million, of which 87% of output was exported.
The largest non-energy mineral imports are
metals (ores, concentrates and scrap—valued
at £1.6 billion in 1997), refined non-ferrous
metals (£3.7 billion) and non-metallic mineral
products (£4.7 billion, of which rough
diamonds account for £2.8 billion).

Water Supply
About 75% of the UK’s water supplies are
obtained from mountain lakes, reservoirs and
river intakes; and about 25% from underground
sources (stored in layers of porous rock). South¬
east England and East Anglia are more
dependent on groundwater than any other parts
By 1870, in preference to entire or partial
reliance on cesspools, 146 out of 178 larger
towns in England and Wales removed their
household wastes through sewers, but only
46 treated the sewage before disposal into
watercourses. Victorian Britain strove to
develop an institutional and regulatory
water regime to facilitate the emergence of a
modern water supply industry, with an
emphasis on municipal enterprise. Private
companies were held to lack the resources to
contemplate works on the scale carried out
by municipal management. In 1901, 90% of
provincial towns provided their own water.
The achievements of Glasgow, Liverpool,
Birmingham and Manchester in providing a
full supply of water from distant sources,
free from contamination, were much
admired. By 1904 undertakings in the water
industry in England and Wales numbered
870 local authorities, eight water boards and
joint committees, and 221 water companies.
of the UK. Scotland and Wales have a relative
abundance of unpolluted water from upland
sources. Northern Ireland also has plentiful
supplies for domestic use and for industry.
Water put into the public supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in
England and Wales averaged 15,981
megalitres a day (Ml/d) in 1997-98, of which
average daily consumption per head was about
160 litres. An average of 2,336 Ml/d was
supplied in Scotland in 1997-98. In Northern
Ireland the figure was 690 Ml/d.
Some 30,273 Ml/d were abstracted from
rivers in England and Wales in 1997, of which
public water supplies accounted for 11,822
Ml/d. The electricity supply industry took
11,880 Ml/d; fish farming, cress growing and
amenity ponds 3,887 Ml/d; and agriculture 8
Ml/d, with spray irrigation accounting for a
further 151 Ml/d.
England and Wales
Water Companies
Ten water and sewerage companies in
England and Wales have statutory
responsibilities for water supply, its quality
and sufficiency, and for sewerage and sewage
treatment. The supply-only companies, after
various mergers since 1989, have decreased in
number from 29 to 17. They supply water to
nearly a quarter of the population.
The Water Industry Act 1999 implements
government policy in three key areas:
• removing the threat of disconnection,
which could be a danger to their health,
from very poor households who have
difficulty in paying their water and
sewerage bills;
• protecting households on low incomes,
and people with medical conditions for
whom high use of water is a necessity, by
offering them special tariffs; and
• promoting increased customer choice on
whether they have a water meter or not.
Since 1989 water bills have risen by more than
a third in real terms. While the Government
requires the water companies to invest
between £8 billion and £8.5 billion in
improvements in water quality and in meeting
503
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
new UK and EU environmental standards up
to 2005, it wants to ensure that customers do
not have to face unreasonably high bills.
Although it has been argued that higher water
prices, combined with metering, would
control demand for water and reflect the
environmental costs of water use, the
Government considers that people and firms
must be able to afford the water they need,
and families should face neither hardship
because of water bills nor disconnection. It
does not favour compulsory metering.
In April 1999 the water companies submitted
their business plans for 2000-05 to the Director
General of Water Services, who heads Ofwat,
the industry’s regulatory body. The plans
include the minimum prices they believe they
need to finance continued provision of services
and deliver the environmental and water quality
programmes that the Government has
requested.5 The companies have been asked to
develop charging arrangements which
distinguish between water for essential and
discretionary purposes.
About 14% of households and 80% of
commercial and industrial customers are
charged for water on the basis of consumption
measured by meter. Most homes are charged
according to the rateable value of their
property. Fifteen water companies supply free
meters to households on request. Average
water and sewerage bills for households
without a meter have risen from £245 in
1998-99 to £255 in 1999-2000; for those with
a meter by less than £1 to £205.
The overall quality of UK drinking water is
high: nearly 99.8% of some 2.8 million tests in
England and Wales in 1998 met standards that
are in some cases more strict than those in the
1980 EC Drinking Water Directive. A new
EC Directive, adopted in 1998, requires
member states to meet a number of even more
stringent standards, for example an obligation
to ensure maximum concentrations of lead in
water of 25 microgrammes per litre within five
years and 10 pg/1 within 15 years.
5 These are expected to include dismantling what remains
of Victorian sewerage systems; tanks to prevent sewage
overflows; removal of lead from supply pipes; and
replacement of iron water mains, which cause
discoloration.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI)
checks that water companies meet the
drinking water quality regulations.
Enforcement action is taken when there are
infringements of standards. The DWI also
investigates incidents and consumer
complaints about quality, and initiates
prosecution if water unfit for human
consumption has been supplied.
The roof of the Millennium Dome (see
p. ix) will be used to collect rain for a water
recycling system, developed by Thames
Water. Rain falling on the 20-acre roof will
be collected and treated in a reed bed, then
used for flushing lavatories around the site.
The Government is backing Thames
Water’s plan to pump out about 68 million
litres of groundwater a day from 50 new
boreholes around London to stop the
capital flooding from a water table rising
by up to 10 feet a year—which could affect
foundations of buildings within five years.
Some of the cleaner water would be used
for drinking, industrial use, watering
London’s parks or cleaning streets. The
rest would go into the sewerage system for
discharge into the Thames in east London.
The initial cost is estimated at £10 million,
with costs of £2 million a year thereafter.
Ensuring Supplies
The Government will bring forward
legislation to put time limits on water
abstraction licences. It plans to bring to an
end, by 2012, compensation for curtailment of
licences if they damage the environment by
drying up rivers and harming wetlands. All
future licences would be limited to about
15 years.
About 25% of the public water supply is
lost through leakage. The Director General of
Water Services has set the companies
mandatory targets to reduce overall leakage
between 1996—97 and 2000 by 26% enough
to provide 14 million baths a day. The
industry is committed to spending £816
million on leakage repair over 1998-2000 and
£1.7 billion on mains rehabilitation and
replacement.
504
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
All the companies except one offer a free
leak-repair service for customers’ supply pipes.
Tougher regulations for water efficiency of
equipment and fittings are being introduced.
Scotland
Responsibility for the provision of water and
sewerage services rests with three public
bodies—the North, West and East of Scotland
Water Authorities. The Water Industry Act
1999 established a Water Industry
Commissioner for Scotland who promotes
customer interests and advises the Scottish
Executive about the level of the authorities’
charges. Water Industry Consultative
Committees for each of the authorities advise
the Commissioner about customer interests.
Modernisation of the water industry is in
progress, with the authorities investing more
than £1.7 billion over three years, including
projects worth £600 million in partnership
with the private sector. New water treatment
plants are being built and all major towns are
expected to benefit from new sewerage works
by the end of 2000. Prices for water services
depend on the type of consumer: domestic
consumers pay amounts based on their council
tax band (see p. 411) or metered charges, and
non-domestic consumers pay non-domestic
water rates, or metered charges.
Northern Ireland
In November 1998 the Government issued a
consultation paper on water and sewerage
services in Northern Ireland, in which it
envisaged expenditure of up to £2.5 billion
over 15-20 years to bring services up to
standard and to meet increasing demand.
(Some of the main sewers of Belfast date from
Victorian times and may be at risk of collapse.)
An extra 10% in water rates bills would be
necessary to pay for these improvements.
Decisions would be a matter for the Northern
Ireland Executive and Assembly

The service sector in the United Kingdom is continuing to grow and now
contributes about 66% of gross value added at constant 1995 prices and 75% of
employment. Around 20.8 million people have jobs in the service sector, a rise
of nearly 800,000 in the last two years.
Competition in many financial services, such as personal savings, consumer
credit and mortgages, has intensified as existing providers have extended their
services and as new entrants, such as supermarkets, have begun to offer financial
services. Telephone-based services are becoming much more widespread, for
example in banking and in motor and household insurance, and some providers
(such as banks and stockbrokers) are offering Internet-based services. The UK
has the highest level of credit card usage in Europe. A major reform of the system
of financial regulation and supervision is in progress.
As a result of rising real incomes, consumer
spending on financial, personal and leisure
services has increased considerably. Travel,
hotel and restaurant services in the UK are
among those to have benefited from the
growth in tourism, and the UK is one of the
world’s leading tourist destinations. Computer
services, business services and recreation
activities are among the non-financial sectors
which experienced strong growth in turnover
in 1998 (see Table 30.1).
Financial Services
The UK’s financial services sector accounts for
7% of gross domestic product (GDP) and
employs over 1 million people. Historically the
heart of the industry has been in the ‘Square
Mile’ in the City of London, and this remains
broadly the case. Among the major financial
institutions and markets in the City are the
Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange,
Lloyd’s insurance market, and the London
506
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
During the 19th century there was a
process of consolidation in the banking
industry, and many of the private banks
were acquired by joint stock banks.
Consolidation continued during the early
20th century, so that by the 1920s and
1930s there were five large retail banking
groups. By contrast, in 1900 there were
over 2,200 incorporated building societies,
with assets of £46 million. Since then, the
number of societies has contracted
through mergers and takeovers and is now
around 70, although membership (the
number of savers and borrowers) of
building societies has risen considerably.
The number of people holding a Post
Office savings account rose substantially
from 4.8 million at the end of 1890 to 8.4
million by the end of 1900. The Stock
Exchange made a growing contribution to
financing development during the 19th
century, for example, for the growth of
railways—both in the UK and overseas—
and by 1899 the value of the securities of
companies quoted on the Exchange was
£5,411 million.
International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange. The City is one of the world’s three
leading financial centres, along with Tokyo
and New York, and by far the biggest in
Europe. An important feature is the size of its
international activities. It is noted for having:
• more overseas banks than any other
financial centre;
• the biggest market in the world for
trading foreign equities, accounting for
59% of global turnover;
• by far the world’s biggest foreign
exchange market, actively trading the
largest range of currencies and handling
about 32% of worldwide dealing;
• the largest fund management centre, with
around US $1,808 billion of institutional
equity holdings;
• the fourth largest insurance market and
the leading international insurance
centre;
• the major international centre for primary
and secondary dealing in the Euromarket;
• the most important centre in the world
for advice on privatisation; and
• a full range of ancillary and support
services, including legal, accountancy and
management services.
Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) is the
fifth largest centre in the EU, in terms of
institutional equity funds managed.
Manchester, Cardiff, Liverpool and Leeds are
also important financial centres.

businesses to develop commercial
opportunities internationally, and works to
achieve greater liberalisation of international
trade in financial and related services. Net
overseas earnings of the UK financial sector
have nearly trebled in the last five years,
reaching a record £31.9 billion in 1998.
REGULATION
Government proposals for a major reform of
the regulation of financial services were
announced in 1997, when a new Financial
Services Authority (FSA) was established.
Following extensive consultation on draft
legislation, the Financial Services and Markets
Bill was introduced into Parliament in June
1999, with the intention of becoming law in
spring 2000. As well as formally establishing
the FSA, the Bill provides for:
• replacement of the system based in part
on self-regulation by a fully statutory
system;
• a new single compensation scheme;
• a single ombudsman system;
• a single tribunal; and
• powers to tackle market abuse.
FSA Objectives and Functions
The Bill sets out statutory objectives for the
FSA, including maintaining confidence in the
UK financial system and promoting public
understanding of it, protecting consumers and
reducing financial crime. In delivering these
objectives, the FSA will have to be efficient
and economic, facilitate innovation in financial
services and take account of the international
nature of financial services business. To
ensure that the new regime will be open and
accountable, the FSA will be required to
maintain consumer and practitioner panels
(which will have a role in assessing the FSA’s
performance against its statutory objectives),
to hold a public meeting each year to discuss
its annual report, and to consult on its
arrangements for independent investigation of
complaints against itself.
The FSA will eventually be a single regulator
for all financial firms and markets, bringing
together the functions previously handled by
nine regulatory bodies. In 1998 it acquired from
the Bank of England responsibility for banking
supervision, and the Treasury has contracted
out to the FSA the exercise of the majority of its
functions under legislation on insurance. The
FSA also supervises the UK’s six recognised
investment exchanges (such as the London
Stock Exchange), and is responsible for
recognising and supervising the clearing houses,
which organise the settlement of transactions on
these exchanges. In addition, it is currently
supply ing regulatory and other services under
contract to a number of bodies which it will
replace when the Bill takes effect:
• the Building Societies Commission;
• the Friendly Societies Commission;
• the Registry of Friendly Societies; and
• three self-regulating organisations—the
Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (regulating about 1,100 fund
management firms), the Securities and
Futures Authority (covering most aspects
of securities trading and having about 1,300
members) and the Personal Investment
Authority (PIA, regulating about 4,000
firms, including product providers and
independent financial advisers).
In May 1999 the FSA issued its consumer
education strategy to meet the objective of
promoting public understanding of the
financial system. A key priority will be
ensuring that managing money is taught in
more schools. Impartial information will be
provided by the FSA to help consumers
plan their finances and make informed
choices. In the March 1999 Budget the
Chancellor of the Exchequer announced
that the FSA would publish ‘league tables’
of costs and charges in savings, insurance
and pensions products, so that consumers
would be better able to assess the products
available. The Government hopes that this
will help to avoid the problems of mis-
selling which have arisen on certain financial
products, such as personal pensions.
508
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Banking Supervision
Banks are required to meet minimum
standards on the integrity and competence of
directors and management, the adequacy of
capital and cash flow, and the systems and
controls to deal with the risks they experience.
If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its activities
may be restricted, or it may be closed. These
arrangements are intended to strengthen, but
not guarantee, the protection of bank
depositors, thereby increasing confidence in
the banking system as a whole.
Compensation Schemes
Various compensation schemes, funded by the
financial services providers, currently exist to
protect investors and depositors if authorised
firms are unable to meet their liabilities:
• the Deposit Protection Scheme, for bank
customers, and the Building Societies
Investor Protection Scheme, which both
provide customers with protection of up
to 90% of their deposits, subject to a
maximum for each scheme of £18,000;
• the Policyholders Protection Scheme, which
provides protection for certain insurance
company policyholders of 100% of
claims on specified compulsory insurance
policies and 90% on other policies, with
no maximum limit; and
• the Investors Compensation Scheme, which
can make payments of up to £48,000 to
private investors if a regulated firm is
unable to meet its investment business
liabilities—since 1988 it has helped
customers of about 1,050 firms, and paid
out £154 million to more than 13,500
investors.
Under the Financial Services and Markets
Bill, a single Compensation Scheme will be set
up.
Financial Services Ombudsman
The Bill provides for the creation of a new
Financial Services Ombudsman as a single
point of access for complaints. With an annual
budget of around £15 million, it will be the
largest ombudsman scheme in the world. It
will bring together eight main schemes,
including those covering banking, building
societies, insurance and firms conducting
investment business. All firms authorised by
the FSA will have to observe the
Ombudsman’s procedures.
International Agreements
The UK plays a major role in efforts to
maintain global prosperity and prevent
financial crises. The Group of Seven (G7)
leading major industrialised countries agreed
in 1998 on measures to reform the
international financial system, including
enhanced global financial supervision and
regulation. A new Financial Stability Forum
has been set up, bringing together G7 national
authorities, international regulatory bodies
and leading financial institutions, such as the
Bank for International Settlements. The
Forum has established three working
groups—on hedge funds, offshore centres and
capital flows—to examine areas where global
financial regulation might be improved.
The UK has ratified a World Trade
Organisation agreement, which came into
force in March 1999, on liberalising trade in
financial services. This is expected to result in
improved access to financial services markets
around the world.
HM Treasury represents the UK in
negotiating EC Directives on the financial
services sector, co-ordinating as necessary
with the FSA, the Bank of England and other
bodies. The Directives aim to provide a
regulatory framework to allow banking,
investment and insurance firms to operate
throughout the European Economic Area
(EEA, see p. 81) on the basis of their home
state authorisation.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its capital stock was acquired
by the Government in 1946. Fundamental
changes to the Bank’s role took effect under
the Bank of England Act 1998. The most
significant was the acquisition of operational
responsibility for setting interest rates.
509
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
As the UK’s central bank, the Bank’s
overriding objective is to maintain a stable
and efficient monetary and financial
framework for the effective operation of the
economy. In pursuing this goal, it has three
main purposes:
• maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
• maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
• seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Monetary Policy Framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to
deliver price stability, as defined by the target
stipulated by the Government (see p. 388), by
setting short-term interest rates. This
responsibility rests with the Bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee, which comprises the
Governor, the two Deputy Governors and six
other members. The Committee meets
monthly and interest rate decisions are
announced as soon as is practicable after the
meeting. The Committee is accountable to the
Bank’s Court of Directors as regards its
procedures and to Parliament.
Financial Stability
Under the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Bank, HM Treasury and the FSA,
the Bank is responsible for the overall stability of
the financial system, and has set up a Financial
Stability Committee to oversee its work in this
area. In exceptional circumstances, it may
provide financial support as a last resort to
prevent problems affecting one financial
institution from spreading to other parts of the
financial system. The Bank also oversees the
effectiveness of the financial sector in meeting
the needs of customers and in maintaining the
sector’s international competitiveness. It assisted
the City of London in preparing its wholesale
markets for the introduction of the euro in
January 1999 and contributed to the Treasury’s
national changeover plan outlining the practical
steps which would be necessary if the UK
decided to join the single currency (see p. 388).
Other Main Functions
The Bank’s money market operations are
designed to smooth out fluctuations in the
flow of cash between the Government and the
private sector, and to steer short-term market
interest rates to levels required to implement
monetary policy. Through its daily operations
in the money market, the Bank supplies the
funds which the banking system as a whole
needs to achieve balance by the end of each
settlement day. It also acts as the Treasury’s
agent in managing the Government’s reserves
of gold and foreign exchange and its foreign
currency borrowing.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It
plays a key role in payment and settlement
systems, and has sole right in England and
Wales to issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit
from the note issue is paid directly to the
Government. Three Scottish and four
Northern Ireland banks may also issue notes,
but these have to be fully backed by Bank of
England notes.
Court of Directors
The Court of Directors, which meets at least
once a month, is responsible for managing the
affairs of the Bank other than the formulation
of monetary policy. It comprises the
Governor, the two Deputy Governors and 16
Directors. The Directors form a sub¬
committee; functions include reviewing the
Bank’s performance in relation to its
objectives and strategy, and the internal
procedures of the Monetary Policy
Committee. The Court is required to report
annually to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
BANKING SERVICES
At the end of March 1999 there were 335
institutions authorised under the Banking Act
1987, including retail banks and investment
banks; 515 institutions were permitted to take
deposits in the UK, including building
societies. A further 110 branches of banks from
other EEA countries were entitled to accept
deposits in the UK on a cross-border basis.
510
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
‘Retail’ banking primarily provides
deposit, withdrawal and loan facilities for
personal customers and small businesses.
Services generally provided include current
accounts, deposit accounts, loan
arrangements, credit and debit cards,
mortgages, insurance, investment products—
including pensions, unit trusts and the new
Individual Savings Accounts (see p. 518)—
and share-dealing services. Nearly all banks
engage in some ‘wholesale’ activities, which
involve taking larger deposits, deploying
funds in money-market instruments, and
making corporate loans and investments.
Some banks, such as the merchant banks and
overseas banks operating in the UK,
concentrate on wholesale business. Many
dealings are conducted on the inter-bank
market, among banks themselves.
Access to Retail Banking Services
Between 91% and 94% of households in the
UK have access to some form of bank account.
However, the Government is concerned that
many people, especially those in the most
deprived neighbourhoods, do not have access
to these basic financial services. Two policy
teams in the Treasury are examining the
problems of financial exclusion: one on the
lack of access to personal financial services,
and the other on finance and support for small
firms.
The Government has set up an
independent review of UK banking
services, excluding investment banking,
which is looking at the levels of
competition, efficiency and innovation,
and examining how these compare with
international standards. The review’s
remit was widened in April 1999 to cover
the effects of the rapid expansion in
electronic money, especially on money
transmission services.
Retail Banks and Banking Groups
Banks feature prominently among the UK’s
biggest companies (see p. 385). Among the
largest banks, in terms of market
capitalisation, are Lloyds TSB, HSBC
(including its subsidiary Midland), Halifax,
National Westminster, Barclays, Abbey
National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of
Scotland, Woolwich, Alliance & Leicester and
Northern Rock. Standard Chartered, which
mainly operates overseas, has a network of
around 500 offices in nearly 50 countries,
notably in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Most major UK banks own finance houses,
leasing and factoring companies, insurance
companies and unit trust companies. Some
also have overseas subsidiaries or branches.
The number of banks has been increasing,
as several large building societies have joined
the banking sector. In addition, other
businesses, notably insurance companies and
supermarkets, have begun to offer banking
facilities and have attracted large numbers of
depositors. For example, the Prudential
insurance company launched its Egg direct
banking service in October 1998, which
attracted £5 billion of deposits from 500,000
customers in its first six months of operation.
Traditionally, the major banks have
operated through their bank branches, but the
number of branches has been falling as costs
have been cut and as competition has
intensified, notably with the extension of
telephone and computer banking. Through
direct banking services, customers use a
telephone to obtain account information, make
transfers and pay bills, or conduct transactions
via a personal computer; services are often
available throughout the day and night.
Banking services using the Internet are
gradually becoming more widely available.
Other steps taken by the banks to contain costs
include the introduction of self-service kiosks
containing automated teller machines (ATMs)
for dispensing and depositing money, and
reductions in staffing, especially through
centralising ‘back-office’ operations and
reducing head office and support functions.
Investment Banks
Investment banks offer a range of professional
financial services, including corporate finance
and asset management. They have an
important role in equity and debt markets, and
are increasingly trading in securities and in
511
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
futures and options. A major activity is the
provision of advice and financial services to
companies, especially in the case of mergers,
takeovers and other forms of corporate
reorganisation. Investment banks have
considerable expertise in advising
governments on privatisation. Several UK-
owned investment banks have been acquired
by overseas concerns.
Overseas Banks
The UK, with around 20% of cross-border
bank lending, is the world’s largest single
market for international banking. Banks from
around 80 countries have subsidiaries,
branches or representative offices in London.
France has the greatest number—48—
followed by Japan, Italy and the United
States. Like the major UK banks, these
overseas banks offer a comprehensive banking
service in many parts of the world, and engage
in financing trade not only between the UK
and other countries but also between third-
party countries.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. As
well as their retail deposit-taking services,
they specialise in housing finance, making
long-term mortgage loans against the
security of property—usually private
dwellings purchased for owner-occupation.
Some of the larger societies provide a full
range of personal banking services.
Following the Building Societies Acts 1986
and 1997, societies can undertake, with a few
exceptions, an unrestricted variety of
activities, enabling them to respond quickly
to developments in the financial services and
housing markets. The chief requirements for
societies are that:
• their principal purpose is making loans
which are secured on residential property
and are funded substantially by their
members;
• at least 75% of lending has to be on the
security of housing; and
• a minimum of 50% of funds must be in
the form of shares held by individual
members.
There are 70 authorised building societies,
all of which are members of the Building
Societies Association, with assets of around
£156 billion. The largest is the Nationwide,
with assets of £52 billion. Other large societies
are Bradford & Bingley, Britannia and
Yorkshire.
The sector has been contracting as a result
of several large societies abandoning their
mutual status and becoming banks. The most
recent to leave the sector was Birmingham
Midshires, the fifth largest society at the time
of its acquisition by Halifax pic in 1999. In
April 1999 members of the Bradford &
Bingley (the second biggest society) voted in
support of a motion to convert the society to a
bank, and the society is working towards
conversion by the end of 2000. Although
building societies no longer have the largest
share of the housing finance market, they are
still competing fiercely with the banks and are
taking a significant share of new mortgages
and attracting substantial deposits from
savers. Several of the biggest societies have
taken steps to defend their mutual status, by
changing their voting rules to raise the
threshold for a successful vote on conversion,
or by requiring new members to donate to
charity any ‘windfall’ payments arising from a
conversion.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS). One system covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service, Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS). A
third covers bulk electronic clearing for
standing orders and direct debits. A total of 27
banks and building societies are members of
one or more clearing companies, while others

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
obtain access to APACS clearing through
agency arrangements with one of the
members.
Trends in Financial Transactions
Major changes in the nature of financial
transactions have included the rapid growth in
the use of plastic cards (which first appeared
in 1966) and of automated teller machines
(ATMs). There are 112 million plastic cards
in circulation in the UK, and 84% of adults
have one or more cards. The use of cash and
cheques has recently been declining (see Table
30.2), although cash continues to be the most
popular form of payment in terms of the
volume of transactions—about two-thirds of
payments above £1 are made in cash.
The installation of ATMs has greatly
improved consumers’ access to cash,
particularly outside bank opening hours; their
number has risen by 72% in the last ten years,
to 24,600 at the end of 1998. All the major
retail banks and building societies participate
in nationwide networks of ATMs; in 1999 the
LINK network became the first to cover the
machines of all the main banks. There were
1,850 million cash withdrawals from ATMs in
1998, the average withdrawal being £53.
Plastic Cards
The main types of plastic card are cheque
guarantee cards, debit cards, credit cards,
charge cards and cash cards, although
individual cards frequently cover more than
one use, such as a cheque guarantee and cash
card. Cheque guarantee cards entitle holders
to cheque-cashing facilities in participating
institutions, and guarantee retailers that
transactions up to a specified limit—typically
£50 or £100—will be honoured. Charge cards
are similar to credit cards, but are designed to
be paid off in full each month; they are usually
available only to those with relatively high
income or assets. Several major retailers issue
store cards for use within their own outlets.
New electronic purse cards are being tested:
cards are ‘charged’ with money from the card
holder’s bank account, and can be used to
purchase goods or services at participating
retailers through electronic tills.
The UK has the highest level of
expenditure on credit cards in Europe, with an
average expenditure per card in 1998 of
£1,550. There are over 41 million credit cards
(including charge cards) in use in the UK, and
49% of adults have at least one credit card.
Most credit cards are affiliated to one of the
two major international organisations, Visa

and MasterCard. Barclays is by far the largest
issuer, with 6.8 million customers owning 9.3
million cards. Competition has increased, with
a number of new providers entering the
market. There are over 1,300 different types
of credit card, with particularly rapid growth
in the number of ‘affinity’ cards, where the
card is linked to an organisation such as a
charity or trade union.
Debit cards, where payments are deducted
directly from the purchaser’s current account,
were first issued in 1987. Purchases using
debit cards are rising rapidly, up by 16% in
1998. Over 42 million cards have been issued,
and some 77% of adults in the UK hold a
debit card, often combined with cheque
guarantee and ATM facilities. There are four
debit card schemes in operation: Switch, Solo,
Visa Delta and Visa Electron.
Banks have been concerned at the level of
fraud on plastic cards, which was estimated to
cost £135 million in 1998. In April 1999 they
began to replace existing cards (which have a
magnetic strip) with ‘smart’ cards, in which
information is contained on a microchip
embedded in the card; these are more difficult
to counterfeit. Smart cards also store much
more information than was previously possible.
National Savings
National Savings, an executive agency of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a source of
finance for government borrowing and offers
personal savers a range of investments. Since
April 1999 most National Savings operations—
including its three main sites in Blackpool,
Durham and Glasgow—have been run by
Siemens Business Services under a 15-year
contract, with National Savings retaining
responsibility for policy and marketing. In
March 1999, £63.8 billion was invested in
National Savings. Sales of National Savings
products totalled £12.2 billion in 1998-99. After
allowing for repayments, the net contribution to
government funding was £363 million.
Important products include:
• Premium Bonds, which are held by 23
million people and are entered in a monthly
draw, with tax-free prizes ranging from
£50 to a single top prize of £1 million;
• Savings Certificates, which pay either a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking (rising in line with the
Retail Prices Index);
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Pensioners’ Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, designed to
accumulate capital sums for those under
21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices throughout the UK;
and
• FIRST Option Bonds, which provide a
guaranteed rate of interest fixed for one
year.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial and insurance services, such as small-
scale savings products, life insurance and
provision against loss of income through
sickness or unemployment. The Friendly
Societies Act 1992 enabled friendly societies to
incorporate, take on new powers and provide a
larger variety of financial services through
subsidiaries. In May 1999 the Government
announced proposals to give societies greater
flexibility in extending the range of services
available to their members.
There are around 270 friendly societies, with
total funds of £12 billion and an estimated
membership of over 5 million. By far the largest
society is Liverpool Victoria, which has over
1 million members and manages some £3.3
billion of funds. Other big societies include
Royal Liver Assurance, Family Assurance,
Police Mutual Assurance, Homeowners
Friendly, and Tunbridge Wells Equitable.
Special Financing Institutions
Several specialised institutions offer finance
and support to personal and corporate sector
borrowers:
514
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
• Finance houses and leasing companies
provide consumer credit, business
finance and leasing, and motor finance.
The 100 full members of the Finance and
Leasing Association undertook new
business worth £62 billion in 1998.
• Credit unions—non-profit-making
savings and loans bodies which mainly
serve poorer members of the
community—are less widespread in the
UK than in some other countries.
However, they have grown rapidly
during the 1990s, and are particularly
strong in Northern Ireland. There are
nearly 770 credit unions in the UK, with
a membership of about 475,000 and total
share capital of £376 million. The
Government has issued a consultation
document containing measures to
encourage the expansion of credit unions
in Great Britain, for example, by
widening the range of services, such as
allowing them to offer interest-bearing
accounts, and extending the range of
organisations from which they are
allowed to borrow.
• Factoring comprises a range of financial
services, including credit management
and finance in exchange for outstanding
invoices. The industry provides working
capital to more than 24,000 businesses a
year. Member companies of the Factors
& Discounters Association handled
business worth £57 billion in 1998, 14%
higher than in 1997.
• Vmture capital companies offer medium-
and long-term equity financing for new
and developing businesses, management
buy-outs and buy-ins, and company
rescues. The UK sector is the largest and
most developed in Europe. The British
Venture Capital Association has 214 full
members, which represent virtually every
major source of venture capital in the
UK. During 1998, a record £4.9 billion
was invested by UK venture capital
companies in 1,332 businesses;
investment in the UK accounted for £3.8
billion. US pension funds are the largest
investors in the UK venture capital
industry.
INSURANCE
London is one of the world’s leading centres
for insurance and international reinsurance. It
handles an estimated 20% of the general
insurance business placed on the international
market. As well as UK companies and the
Lloyd’s market (see p. 516), many overseas
firms are represented, with which UK
companies have formed close relationships.
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term (such as life insurance), where
contracts may be for periods of many years;
and general, where contracts are for a year or
less. Most insurance companies reinsure their
risks; this performs an important function in
spreading losses and in helping insurance
companies to manage their businesses.
Long-term Insurance
Around 220 companies handle long-term
insurance. In addition to providing life cover,
life insurance is a vehicle for saving and
investment as premiums are invested in
securities and other assets. About 65% of
households have life insurance cover. Total
long-term insurance assets under management
by companies in 1997 were £640 billion on
behalf of their worldwide operations.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and other
transport risks. Competition has intensified in
areas like motor and household insurance,
with the growth of telephone-based
operations, such as Direct Line (which is now
the largest insurer of private motor vehicles in
the UK). Total worldwide premium income of
members of the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) in 1997 was £40 billion, of which £26
billion was earned in the UK.
515
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 1998, around 800 companies
were authorised to carry on one or more
classes of insurance business in the UK. Over
400 companies belong to the ABI.
The industry includes both public limited
companies and mutual institutions—
companies owned by their policyholders.
Among the biggest insurance companies are
Prudential, CGU, Standard Life (the largest
mutual insurer in Europe), Royal &
SunAlliance, and Norwich Union. There
have been a number of mergers and takeovers
affecting the large insurers. For example,
Sun Life and Provincial (the UK arm of the
French insurance group AXA) acquired
Guardian Royal Exchange in 1999, becoming
the third largest group in both general
insurance and life insurance. The mutual
insurer Scottish Widows is to be acquired by
the banking group Lloyds TSB for £7
billion.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private
insurers in London. It is not a company but a
market for insurance administered by the
Council of Lloyd’s and Lloyd’s Regulatory
and Market Boards.
The net premium income of the market in
1996 was approximately ^4.8 billion. For 1999
the market has a total projected allocated
capacity of £9.87 billion, of which some £7.17
billion (73%) will be capacity supplied by
nearly 670 limited liability members,
representing both companies and individuals
who have converted to limited liability. The
number of individual ‘Names’—wealthy
individuals who accept insurance risks for
their own profit or loss, with unlimited
liability—has fallen from a peak of 34,000 in
the late 1980s to 4,700 in 1999. Members
underwrite through 139 syndicates. Each
syndicate is managed by an underwriting
agent responsible for appointing a professional
underwriter to accept insurance risks and
manage claims on behalf of the members of
the syndicate.
Insurance may only be placed through 133
active Lloyd’s brokers and 12 ‘umbrella’
brokers, which negotiate with Lloyd’s
syndicates on behalf of the insured.
Reinsurance constitutes a large part of Lloyd’s
business—more than 5% of the world’s
reinsurance is placed at Lloyd’s. Around one-
sixth of Lloyd’s current work is in its
traditional marine market, and it has a
significant share of the UK motor insurance
market. Lloyd’s is also a major insurer of
aviation and satellite risks, and underwrites in
all other areas of insurance except long-term
life insurance.
Under the Financial Services and Markets
Bill (see p. 508), the FSA will have extensive
supervisory powers over Lloyd’s, and it has
consulted on how it will exercise these powers.
The FSA’s primary concern will be the
protection of Lloyd’s policyholders against the
risk that valid claims may not be met.
Insurance Brokers and Intermediaries
Medium to large insurance brokers almost
exclusively handle commercial matters, with
the biggest dealing in worldwide risks. Smaller
brokers deal mainly with the general public or
specialise in a particular type of commercial
insurance. Some brokers specialise in
reinsurance business, transferring all or part of
an insurer’s risk to a reinsurer. A statutory
regime of professional standards currently
governs the registration and regulation of
individuals and firms who use the title
‘insurance broker’. However, this will be
abolished under the Financial Services and
Markets Bill. The Government envisages that
there will be a new self-regulating regime for
intermediaries arranging general insurance
business. For intermediaries arranging life
insurance constituting an investment (such as
a personal pension), regulation will be by the
FSA.
Some 16,000 individual insurance brokers
are currently registered, the majority of whom
are employed by about 2,000 limited
companies. Nearly 2,000 individuals carry on
business in their own right. A further 6,000
independent intermediaries operating under
the ABI’s code of practice may also arrange
insurance, but are currently not allowed to use
the title ‘insurance broker’.

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
INVESTMENT
The UK has considerable expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising them how
best to invest their funds. The industry is
estimated to contribute £2.1 billion a year to
GDP and to generate £425 million in overseas
earnings. London is the largest fund
management centre in the world. The main
types of investment fund include pension
schemes, life insurance, unit trusts,
investment trusts and new open-ended
investment companies.
Pension Funds
Total net assets of UK pension funds were
estimated at about £743 billion at the end of
1998. Pension funds are major investors in
securities markets, holding around 22% of
securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Funds are managed mainly by the
investment management houses. Among the
largest are Mercury Asset Management,
Phillips & Drew, Schroders and Gartmore.
Unit Trusts
Nearly 1,800 authorised unit trusts and open-
ended investment companies (oeics) pool
investors’ money, and divide funds into units
or shares of equal size, enabling people with
relatively small amounts of money to benefit
from diversified and managed portfolios. In
the five years to 1999 total funds under
management have nearly doubled, to around
£205 billion, of which £56 billion represent
funds in Personal Equity Plans (see p. 518).
Most unit trusts are general funds, investing
in a wide variety of UK or international
securities, but there are also many specialist
funds.
Over 50 unit trust management groups had
total fund values of more than £1 billion in
May 1999. The three largest groups are
Schroders, Fidelity and M & G (which was
acquired by Prudential in 1999), all of which
have fund values exceeding £10 billion. Unit
trust management groups are represented by
the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment
Funds.
Oeics, which became available in 1997, are
similar to unit trusts, but an investor in an oeic
buys shares in the fund rather than units.
They are designed to enable UK companies to
compete on an equal footing with similar
schemes operating elsewhere in the EU. By
May 1999, 171 oeics had been set up by 23
management groups, while several other
groups are considering the conversion of some
or all of their unit trust funds to oeics.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies, which also offer
the opportunity to diversify risk on a relatively
small lump-sum investment or through
regular savings, are listed on the London
Stock Exchange and their shares are traded in
the usual way. They must invest principally in
securities, and the trusts themselves are
exempt from tax on gains realised within the
funds. Assets are purchased mainly out of
shareholders’ funds, although trusts are also
allowed to borrow money for investment.
There were 300 members of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies in June 1999,
with £65 billion of assets under management
by the industry. The three largest trusts are
the venture capital company 3i Group,
Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust, and
Edinburgh Investment Trust.
Share Ownership
In the last 30 years a notable feature of the
pattern of share ownership has been the
growth in the proportion held by financial
institutions—including pension funds and
insurance companies—and a decline in the
proportion held by individuals (see Table
30.3). At the end of 1997 financial institutions
held ordinary shares valued at £669 billion
(53% of the total), with the largest share held
by insurance companies (£299 billion).
Recent research conducted for the London
Stock Exchange and ProShare (an
independent organisation encouraging share
ownership) showed that 27% of UK adults
owned shares: an estimated 12 million
shareholders, although nearly half owned
shares in just one company. Individual share

ownership rose as the result of the
demutualisation in 1997 of five building
societies and the Norwich Union insurance
company. Eight companies each have over
1 million shareholders, with the Halifax bank
having the largest number (3.5 million). The
number of investment clubs—groups of
individuals, usually about 15 to 20 people,
who regularly invest in shares—has risen to
around 3,800. Privatisation (see p. 386),
employee share schemes and Personal Equity
Plans (PEPs) have also led to increased share
ownership. PEPs allowed tax-free investment
in shares, unit trusts and certain corporate
bonds. Between 1987 and April 1998, an
estimated £53 billion was invested in 15.5
million PEPs.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London’s financial markets
include the London Stock Exchange, the
foreign exchange market, the financial futures
and options market, Eurobond and
Eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s insurance
market (see p. 516), and bullion and
commodity markets.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange is one of the top
four global exchanges and the biggest centre
for trading foreign equities. At the end of
PEPs and TESSAs (Tax Exempt Special
Savings Accounts) were succeeded in April
1999 by Individual Savings Accounts
(ISAs), which will run for at least ten
years. The Government has introduced
ISAs to help encourage savings, especially
among those on more modest incomes, and
to distribute the tax relief on savings more
fairly. They allow tax-free saving of up to
£5,000 a year (£7,000 in 1999-2000).
There are three main elements of an ISA:
• cash—up to an annual total of £1,000
(£3,000 in 1999-2000)—such as in a
bank or building society ISA account;
• stocks and shares—up to a maximum
of £5,000 a year (£7,000 in
1999-2000); and
• life insurance—up to £1,000 a year.
There are two main types of ISA:
• a maxi ISA, which can include all
three elements in a single ISA with
one manager; and
• mini ISAs—an individual can have
three mini ISAs each year, from
different managers, for cash, stocks and
shares, and life insurance, but is not
allowed to take out both a mini ISA
and a maxi ISA in the same tax year.
Early indications are that cash mini ISAs
have proved particularly popular with
savers.
518
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
1998, 2,087 UK and 522 international
companies were listed on the main market,
with a market capitalisation of £1,423 billion
and £2,804 billion respectively. A further 312
companies, with a total capitalisation of £4.4
billion, were listed on AIM, the Alternative
Investment Market, primarily for small, young
and growing companies. Over £2.2 billion has
been raised on the AIM since its establishment
in 1995. CREST, a computerised settlement
system for shares and other company
securities, now handles the settlement of all
company securities traded in the UK.
The value and volume of equity business
on the Exchange reached record levels in
1998. Turnover in international equities was
51% higher than in 1997, at £2,183 billion,
while turnover in UK equities was up by 2%,
to £1,037 billion. About 83% of international
equity business represented trades in
European shares, in particular those of
France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
In 1997 the Exchange introduced an
electronic order book, through which share
transactions between buyers and sellers are
matched automatically, rather than being
passed through market-making firms under
the ‘quote-driven’ system. The order book
covers the largest UK shares, including the 100
biggest companies in the FTSE 100 (‘Footsie’)
index. By the end of 1998, about 56% of the
number of trades in FTSE 100 shares were
being handled through the new order book.
A variety of other products for raising
capital are handled, including Eurobonds (see
below), warrants, depositary receipts and gilt-
edged stock (see p. 404). The London Stock
Exchange provides a secondary or trading
market where investors can buy or sell gilts.
Preparations for the introduction of the euro
in January 1999 (see p. 80) included the
development of a new range of euro-
denominated products, which are designed to
help maintain London’s prominent position
among international exchanges.
In May 1999 London and seven other
leading European exchanges—Amsterdam,
Brussels, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Paris and
Zurich—signed an agreement to work towards
harmonising the markets for their leading
securities and developing a pan-European
equity market. The aim is to create a single
electronic trading platform, with common
rules and regulations, for the top European
‘blue chip’ equities. In July 1999 the Exchange
announced its intention to change the basis of
its ownership, under which it is owned by its
294 members, to a new structure designed to
equip the Exchange’s business to meet in a
more appropriate way the changing nature of
the electronic marketplace in equities.
Euromarket
The Euromarket began with Eurodollars—US
dollars lent outside the United States—and
has developed into a major market in a variety
of currencies lent outside their domestic
markets. London is at the centre of the
Euromarket and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms. Its
share of trading in the two main types of
international bonds—Eurobonds and foreign
bonds—is around 70% of the market of about
£8,450 billion in 1997.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for about
30% of global net daily turnover in foreign
exchange. A survey by the Bank of England in
1998 found that daily turnover in the UK was
US $637 billion, 37% up since the previous
survey in 1995. Dealing is now conducted
entirely through telephone and electronic links
between the banks, other financial institutions
and a number of firms of foreign exchange
brokers which act as intermediaries. The
institutions keep close contact with financial
centres abroad and quote buying and selling
rates throughout the day for both immediate
(‘spot’) and forward transactions in many
currencies. Turnover is increasingly in
forward rather than spot transactions.
Financial Futures and Options
Financial derivatives, including ‘futures’ and
‘options’, offer a means of protection against
changes in prices, exchange rates and interest
rates. ‘Futures’ are contracts to deliver or take
delivery of financial instruments or physical
519
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
commodities at a future date, while ‘options’
give the right but not the obligation to buy or
sell financial instruments or physical
commodities on a stated date at a
predetermined price. Financial futures and
options are traded at the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(LIFFE), which has 230 members, including
many of the world’s leading financial
institutions. LIFFE is in the process of
gradually converting to electronic trading,
which will eventually replace the ‘open outcry’
trading facilities, under which members
execute their business through a system of
hand signals and shouting on the trading floor.
LIFFE handled 194 million futures and
options contracts in 1998, and currently it is
handling an average of 482,000 contracts a
day, with a nominal average value of £203
billion. LIFFE also handles commodity
trading, following its merger in 1996 with the
London Commodity Exchange. Coffee, cocoa
and sugar are the most frequently traded
commodities, while trading also takes place in
grain, potatoes and the dry freight index.
Other Exchanges
Other important City exchanges include:
• the London bullion market—around 60
banks and other financial trading
companies participate in the London
gold and silver markets;
• the London Clearing House, which clears
and settles business on a number of
exchanges;
• the London Metal Exchange—the primary
base metals market in the world, trading
contracts in aluminium, aluminium alloy,
copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc;
• the International Petroleum Exchange', and
• the Baltic Exchange—the world’s leading
international shipping market.
Other Services
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale is a major
economic activity. The large wholesalers and
retailers of food and drink operate extensive
distribution networks, either directly or
through contractors.
WHOLESALING
In 1999 there were over 113,000 businesses
(see Table 30.4) engaged in wholesaling and
dealing in the UK. About 27% were sole
proprietors and 15% partnerships. Some 1.1
million people in the UK were employed in
this sector in March 1999. Turnover in 1996,
the latest year for which information is
available, was almost £344 billion.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small
wholesalers and independent grocery retailers
belong to voluntary ‘symbol’ groups (for
example, Spar, Cost Cutter, Londis and
Mace), which provide access to central
purchasing facilities and co-ordinated
promotions. This has helped smaller retailers
to remain relatively competitive; many local
and convenience stores and village shops
would not otherwise be able to stay in
business. Booker, Batleys and Makro are the
major ‘cash and carry’ wholesalers. Palmer and
Harvey McLane is the principal food services
delivery wholesaler, now that Booker
Wholesale Foods has sold the remainder of its
business to them. London’s wholesale markets
play a significant part in the distribution of
fresh foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the
main market for fruit and vegetables, London
Central Markets for meat and Billingsgate for
fish.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society
(CWS) is the principal supplier of goods and
services to the Co-operative Movement and
was a founder member of the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group. The latter was formed
in 1993 to act as a central marketing, buying
and distribution partnership for retail co¬
operative societies. The Group now accounts
for around 90% of Co-op food trade. 1 he
CWS is also the largest co-operative retailer in
Europe, with 680 stores located in Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the east and south
Midlands, and south-east and north-east
England; 644 of these are food stores. Retail
co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,

small deposit on a minimum share. The Co¬
operative Movement, which comprises 48
independent societies, has nearly 4,650 stores.
RETAILING
The retail sector accounts for 37% of all
consumer expenditure. In 1999 there were
nearly 203,000 retail businesses in the UK (see
Table 30.4); 44% were sole proprietors and
36% partnerships. Nearly 2.4 million people
in the UK were employed in this sector in
March 1999. Turnover in 1996, the latest year
for which information is available, was over
£193 billion, of which retail turnover
represented £181.5 billion. Businesses range
from national supermarket and other retail
chains to independent corner grocery shops,
hardware stores, chemists, newsagents and a
host of other types of retailer. During recent
years the large multiple retailers have grown
considerably, tending to increase outlet size
and diversify product ranges. Some, such as
Marks & Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco,
also operate overseas, through either
subsidiaries or franchise agreements. Small
independent retail businesses and co-operative
societies have been in decline for some time.
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to
allow retailers to open for specified periods on
Sundays; smaller retailers are permitted to
open on Sundays for longer hours than the
larger supermarkets and department stores, to
help their competitive position. The main
supermarket chains are experimenting with
24-hour opening on selected days. They are
also looking closely at different forms of home
shopping (by telephone, fax and Internet) and
delivery. Iceland was among the first to start
home deliveries on a national basis.
The four biggest supermarket chains by
sales value are Tesco (with about 586 stores),
J. Sainsbury (391, excluding 13 Savacentre
stores), Asda (210, excluding Dales)—which is
to be acquired by the US retailing group Wal-
Mart—and Safeway (451, excluding Presto
and Wellworths). They accounted for 47% of
total grocery sales, worth £43.8 billion in
1998, including over 45% of UK food sales. In
April 1999 the Director General of Fair
Trading asked the Competition Commission
(see p. 396) to investigate the supply of
groceries from multiple stores in the UK.
521
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
This follows an inquiry in 1998 which looked
at profit levels of the ‘Big Four’. Other
significant food retailers are Somerfield,
Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Iceland and
Morrisons which account for 17% of grocery
sales. Morrisons, Britain’s sixth-largest
supermarket chain, is currently expanding
into the south of England. Alcoholic drinks
are sold mainly in specialist ‘off licences’ and
supermarkets. The principal off-licence
specialists are Threshers and Victoria Wine
(both owned by First Quench Retailing),
Parisa Group, Unwins and Oddbins.
The leading mixed retail chains are found
in high streets nationwide. Among them are
Marks & Spencer (mainly selling clothing and
food and drink), Boots (pharmaceuticals and
cosmetic goods), F. W. Woolworth (over 750
branches selling a variety of products, from
clothing to kitchenware), W. H. Smith
(newspapers, books and stationery), Great
Universal Stores and its Argos subsidiary
(which keeps in stock an extensive range of
goods ordered in the stores from a catalogue
and then taken away by customers), and John
Lewis and Debenhams (a variety of wares,
including clothing, furniture and electrical
goods). Several chains of DIY (Do-It-
Yourself) stores and superstores cater for
people carrying out their own repairs and
improvements to their homes and gardens;
they stock tools, decorating and building
materials, kitchen and bathroom fittings, and
garden products. The three biggest are
Kingfisher’s B&Q, J. Sainsbury’s Homebase
and Wickes.
The large multiple groups have broadened
their range of goods and services. Large food
retailers are also placing greater emphasis on
selling own-label goods (which now account
for over half of sales) and environmentally
friendly products (including organic produce),
together with household wares and clothing.
In-store pharmacies, post offices, customer
cafeterias and dry-cleaners are now a feature
of large supermarkets, which have also begun
selling books, magazines, newspapers, pre¬
recorded videos, cassettes and compact discs.
‘Stores within stores’ are common; for
example, sportswear and sports goods retailers
are to be found in several of the big mixed
department stores. The major supermarket
chains have their own petrol stations at some
of their bigger outlets (see p. 523). Several
large retailers offer personal finance facilities
in an attempt to encourage sales, particularly
of high-value goods, while others, including
Marks & Spencer and Boots, are diversifying
into financial services. Some supermarkets
now offer banking facilities. Boots announced
in May 1999 that it was opening its first ‘in-
house’ dental surgery. ‘Loyalty’ cards were
introduced in the mid-1990s by supermarket
and other retail groups, giving regular
customers cash discounts related to the size of
their purchases and providing the stores with
detailed information on shoppers’ buying
habits.
A recent survey by NatWest and the British
Franchise Association (BFA) estimates that
there are 596 fully-fledged business-format
franchises, with around 30,000 outlets,
accounting for 300,000 direct jobs in Britain
and with an annual turnover of £7.4 billion.
Franchising is a business in which a company
owning the rights to a particular form of
trading licenses them to franchisees, usually
by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. Franchised activities
operate in many areas, including cleaning
services, film processing, print shops, fitness
centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast food retailing.
Among the large-scale franchise operations are
McDonald’s, KallKwik (fast printing) and
Alldays (with over 800 convenience stores).
About 200 franchisers are members of the
BFA.
In March 1999, 558,000 people were
employed in the UK in retailing motor
vehicles and parts, and in petrol stations.
Many businesses selling new vehicles are
franchised by the motor manufacturers.
Vehicle components are available for sale at
garages which undertake servicing and repair
work and also at retail chains like Halfords and
at independent retailers. Drive-in fitting
centres sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries,
clutches and other vehicle parts; the largest
chains include Kwik-Fit and ATS. There
were 13,756 retail outlets for petrol at the end
of 1998; the three companies with the highest
number are Esso, BP Amoco and Shell. The
number of petrol stations has declined by
522
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
about 32% in the last decade, reflecting
intense competition in the sector, relatively
low profit margins and consolidation among
operators. This is particularly so in rural areas.
Petrol stations are increasingly offering other
retail services, such as shops, car washes and
fast food outlets, with the aim of attracting
more business. Over one-fifth of petrol sold in
the UK comes from the 977 supermarket
forecourts operated at the end of 1998.
All kinds of goods and services can be
purchased through mail order catalogues from
such firms as Great Universal Stores,
Littlewoods, Freemans, Grattan and Empire.
In 1997 sales by direct and agency mail order
totalled almost £5 billion. The largest-selling
items are clothing, footwear, furniture,
household textiles and domestic electrical
appliances.
Shopping Facilities
Government policy is to focus new retail
development in existing centres. This is to
ensure that everyone has easy access to a range
of shops and services, whether they have a car
or not; and to enable businesses of all sizes and
types to prosper. The Government aims to
revitalise town centres by focusing new
shopping, leisure and other facilities in these
centres. One of the most significant trends in
retailing has been the spread of superstores,
many of which were built away from urban
centres until recently. Since 1996, social,
economic and environmental considerations
have led the Government and local planning
authorities to limit new retail developments
outside town centres, which had in particular
undermined the viability of existing town and
district centres, encroached on the countryside
and encouraged greater car use. All new retail
development requires planning permission
from the local planning authority, which must
consult central government before granting
permission for most retail developments of
2,500 sq m (27,000 sq ft) or more. Retailers’
attentions are now being turned back to town
centres, redeveloping existing stores and
building smaller outlets. A chain of Tesco
‘Metros’ (1,000 sq m) has been followed by the
opening of J. Sainsbury ‘Central’ stores (1,000
sq m) and ‘Local’ stores (300 sq m).
Regional out-of-town shopping centres, of
which there are eight, are located on sites
offering good road access and ample parking
facilities. The latest is the Bluewater shopping
centre near Dartford, Kent which opened in
March 1999. It is the largest out-of-town retail
development in Europe, covering 160,000 sq m
(1.7 million sq ft), and has created some 7,000
jobs. Built on the site of old chalk quarries,
and surrounded by seven lakes, it has 320
shops and parking for 13,000 cars, and is
expected to attract about 30 million shoppers a
year. It is likely to be the last such out-of-town
centre, as government policy is now to
encourage regeneration of town and city
centres. Apart from Bluewater, other out-of-
town regional shopping centres are: the Metro
Centre at Gateshead in north-east England;
Meadowhall near Sheffield; Trafford Centre
in Manchester; Merry Hill at Dudley in the
West Midlands; Cribbs Causeway at Bristol;
Lakeside at Thurrock in Essex, and Braehead,
near Glasgow. About half of total food sales
are accounted for by superstores away from
town centres, compared with a fifth at the
beginning of the 1980s.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and
computer products, have also built outlets
away from urban centres. There is a
continuing trend towards grouping retail
warehouses into retail parks, often with food
and other facilities, although planning controls
are limiting approvals for new parks.
Information Technology (IT)
Computers monitor stock levels and record
sales figures through electronic point-of-sale
(EPOS) systems. These systems read a bar¬
code printed on the retail item that holds price
and product information and can be used to
generate orders for stock replenishment as well
as totalling up bills and providing a receipt for
customers. Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which products arrive at the store
at the last possible moment before sale, have
become widespread as a result. Leading
retailers have set up electronic data interchange
(EDI) systems; these enable their computers to
communicate with those of their suppliers, and
523
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
transmit orders and invoices electronically, so
reducing errors and saving time.
‘Superscan’ technology—where customers
use an electronic scanning device to work out
their own bills, thus avoiding the need to
queue at a check-out—is undergoing trials in a
number of supermarkets. Electronic home
shopping, using a television and telephone,
and ‘online’ shopping, where personal
computers are linked to databases, are also
being introduced. In 1997, ‘e-commerce’
accounted for only ^125 million of the £9.6
billion home shopping sales market, but it is
growing rapidly.
CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Government aims to maintain and
develop a clear and fair regulatory framework
which gives confidence to consumers and
contributes to the competitiveness of business.
It works closely with outside bodies which
have expert knowledge of consumer issues to
develop policies and legislation.
Consumer Legislation
Under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, it is a
criminal offence to apply false or misleading
statements to goods, services, accommodation
or facilities. False or misleading
advertisements can also be acted against by the
Director General of Fair Trading under the
Control of Misleading Advertisements
Regulations 1988.
Existing legislation covers the sale and
supply of goods and services. The Sale of
Goods Act 1979 (as amended in 1994) ensures
that consumers are entitled to receive goods
which fit their description and are of
satisfactory quality. The Trade Descriptions
Act 1968 prohibits misdescriptions of goods,
In July 1999, the Government issued a White
Paper, Modern Markets: Confident Consumers,
setting out a range of initiatives to improve
protection for consumers. The main proposals
include:
• a hallmark for consumers to identify
companies that have signed up to a
code of practice guaranteeing high
standards of customer service,
including proper redress when things
go wrong;
• a digital hallmark for Internet traders
who abide by codes guaranteeing
security of payment and privacy of
information to enable customers to
shop on the net with confidence;
• the publication of international price
comparisons;
• stronger powers for trading standards
officers and the Office of Fair Trading
to deal with dishonest traders;
• new powers for the courts to ban from
trading those who continually cheat
consumers;
• a speedy procedure to introduce
secondary legislation to outlaw new
scams;
• the development of a new advice
network, building on existing advice
agencies, to give people easier access to
high-quality advice;
• a consumer ‘gateway’ on the Internet
and a trial local customer helpline
which will direct people to the best
sources of advice;
• new measures to ensure information is
accurate, comprehensive and easy to
understand, including clearer prices
and tougher controls on
misdescriptions of services;
• a review of all consumer protection
legislation, to see whether it is still
effective in meeting the needs of
consumers or whether it has become a
burden on business with no apparent
benefit;
• the relaunch of the National Consumer
Council as a more effective voice of
consumers; and
• a full review by the Director General of
Fair Trading of his consumer
protection functions.
524
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
services, accommodation and facilities. This
Act enables regulations to be made requiring
information or instructions relating to goods
to be marked on or to accompany the goods or
to be included in advertisements.
Misleading indications about prices of
goods are covered by the Consumer Protection
Act 1987. This Act also makes it a criminal
offence to supply unsafe products, and
provides product liability rights for
consumers. The regulatory framework to
control product safety is a mixture of
European and UK legislation, voluntary safety
standards and industry codes of practice. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
runs a programme of safety awareness
initiatives. This aims to reduce accidents by
increasing consumer awareness of potential
hazards in the home and by encouraging them
to change their behaviour.1 * 3
The marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
Another law provides for the control of
medical products, and certain other substances
and articles, through a system of licences and
certificates. New regulations have also been
recently introduced to strengthen the
protection of consumers from unscrupulous
doorstep sellers.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair Trading
Act 1973, the Director General can
recommend legislative or other changes to
stop practices adversely affecting consumers’
economic interests; encourage trade
associations to develop codes of practice
promoting consumers’ interests; and
disseminate consumer information and
guidance. The Director General can also
demand assurances as to future conduct from
traders who persistently breach the law to the
detriment of consumers.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended
to protect consumers in their dealings with
credit businesses. Most businesses connected
with the consumer credit or hire industry or
1 Dll's Home Accident Surveillance System shows that,
every year, there are just under 4,000 deaths and nearly
3 million medically treated injuries as a result of home
accidents, which also cost the country about £30 billion.
which supply ancillary credit services—for
example, credit brokers, debt collectors, debt
counsellors and credit reference agencies—
require a consumer credit licence. The Director
General is responsible for administering the
licensing system, including refusing or
revoking licences of those unfit to hold them.
The Director General also has powers to
prohibit unfit people from carrying out estate
agency work; to take court action to prevent the
publication of misleading advertisements; and
to stop traders using unfair terms in standard
contracts with consumers.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection of
the consumer’s economic interests, promotion
of consumer education and strengthening the
representation of consumers. The views of
British consumer organisations on EU matters
are represented by a number of organisations
including the Consumers’ Association (see
p. 526) and the Consumers in Europe Group
(UK). Numerous British consumer bodies also
have a voice on the European consumer
‘watchdog’ body, the Bureau Europeen des
Unions de Consommateurs.
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
is given by 1,200 outlets of around 700 Citizens
Advice Bureaux. Their work is co-ordinated
by a national association linked to the bureaux
via local and regional committees (Scotland has
its own Association). Similar assistance is
provided at trading standards and consumer
protection departments of local authorities (in
Northern Ireland the Department of Economic
Development) and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (and
associated councils for Scotland and Wales),
which receives government finance, gives its
view to government, industry and others on
consumer issues. The General Consumer
Council for Northern Ireland has wide-
ranging duties in consumer affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer. Some trade associations in industry
and commerce have established codes of
practice. In addition, several organisations
525
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
work to further consumer interests by
representing the consumer’s view to
government, industry and other bodies. I he
largest is the Consumers’ Association, funded
by the subscriptions of approximately 1 million
members to its various Which? magazines.
HOTELS AND CATERING
The hotel and restaurant trades, which
include public houses (pubs), wine bars and
other licensed bars in addition to all kinds of
businesses offering accommodation and
prepared food, employed nearly 1.9 million
people in the UK in March 1999 and their
total turnover was about £43 billion. There
are about 10,935 hotels and motels in the UK,
ranging from major hotel groups—the largest,
Forte Hotels, owned by the Granada Group,
has 323 hotels in the UK—to small guest
houses, individually owned. Holiday centres,
including holiday camps with full board, self¬
catering centres and caravan parks, are run by
Butlins, Holiday Club, Center Parcs, Warner
Holidays and Pontin’s, among others.
In 1998 there were around 44,420
restaurants, cafes and take-away food shops in
the UK, with a total turnover of £13.5 billion.
Restaurants offer cuisine from virtually every
country in the world; they cater for the whole
spread of income groups and several of the
highest-quality ones have international
reputations. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Italian,
French and Greek restaurants are among the
most popular. ‘Fast food’ restaurants are
widespread, many of which are franchised.
They specialise in selling hamburgers,
chicken, pizza and a variety of other foods, to
be eaten on the premises or taken away. Well-
known nationwide chains include McDonald’s
and Burger King (hamburgers), KFC
(chicken), Pizza Hut and Pizza Express.
Traditional fish and chip shops are another
main provider of cooked take-away food.
Sandwich bars are common in towns and
cities, typically in areas with high
concentrations of office workers. In 1997
sandwiches accounted for 33.8% of the fast
food market, hamburgers 23.6%, ethnic food
(Chinese and Indian) 13.8%, fish and chips
12.5%, pizzas 10.3% and chicken 6%.
About 51,500 pubs sell beer, wines, soft
drinks and spirits to adults for consumption
on the premises, and most also serve hot and
cold food. Many pubs are owned by the large
brewing companies, such as Whitbread and
Bass, which either provide managers to run
them or offer tenancy agreements; these pubs
tend to sell just their own brands of beer,
although some also offer ‘guest’ beers. Others,
called ‘free houses’, are independently owned
and managed, and frequently serve a variety of
different branded beers. Wine bars are
normally smaller than pubs and tend to
specialise in wine and food; they more closely
resemble bars in other parts of Europe.
‘Themed’ pubs, for example Irish bars, are
becoming increasingly popular.
TRAVEL AGENTS
Most British holiday-makers travelling overseas
buy ‘package holidays’ from travel agencies,
where the cost covers both transport and
accommodation. The most popular package
holiday destinations are Spain and France.
Long-haul holidays to places like the United
States, the Caribbean and Australia have gained
in popularity as air fares have come down. Some
people prefer to travel more independently, and
there are travel firms which will make just travel
arrangements for customers.
Around 80% of high street travel agencies
are members of the Association of British
Travel Agents (ABTA). Although most are
small businesses, a few large firms, such as
Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, have hundreds
of branches. Nearly 670 tour operators are
members of ABTA; about half are both retail
agents and tour operators. Major tour
operators include Thomson, Airtours and
First Choice. ABTA operates financial

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
TOURISM AND LEISURE
Tourism is one of the UK’s key long-term
growth sectors, with total spending on tourism
in 1998 estimated at £61 billion. In the region
of 1.78 million people are employed in tourism
and related activities; of these, around 154,000
are self-employed. About 159,000 businesses,
mainly independent small ones—hotels and
guest houses, restaurants, holiday homes,
caravan and camping parks and so on—are
responsible for providing the bulk of tourism
services; about 8.5% of small businesses are
engaged in tourism.
The number of overseas visitors to the UK
increased by 1% in 1998 to reach an estimated
25.7 million, spending £12.7 billion. The UK’s
share of world tourism earnings reached 4.8%.
Visitors from North America increased by 11%
to 4.6 million, while those from Western
Europe were unchanged at 16.6 million and
from other areas fell by 4%. The highest
proportion from a single country was from the
United States (15%). Business travel accounts
for about £3.9 billion, 30% of all overseas
tourism revenue. London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports, the seaport of Dover and the
Channel Tunnel are the main points of entry.
Some 48% of overseas tourists spend all or
most of their visit in London, while others
venture further afield to see the many
attractions in the English regions as well as
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Domestic tourism generated approximately
£45 billion in 1998. Of British residents
opting to take their main holiday in the UK,
47% choose a traditional seaside destination,
such as Blackpool (Lancashire), Bournemouth
(Dorset), Great Yarmouth (Norfolk) and
resorts in Devon and Cornwall. Short holiday
breaks (up to three nights), valued at £3.1
billion in 1998, make up an increasingly
significant part of the market.
The UK’s historic towns and cities and its
scenic rural and coastal areas continue to have
great appeal for British and overseas tourists
alike. There is a growing interest in heritage,
arts and culture; attractions include museums,
art galleries, historic buildings and
monuments, and theatres, as well as shopping,
sports and business facilities. Domestic and
foreign tourists play an increasingly important
role in supporting the UK’s national heritage
and creative arts, in addition to the large
financial contribution they make to hotels,
restaurants, cafes and bars, and public
transport.
Business travel, which accounts for a
growing share of the tourism market, includes
attendance at conferences, exhibitions, trade
fairs and other business sites. Activity
holidays—based on walking, canoeing,
mountain climbing, or artistic activities, for
example—are becoming more popular. The
Youth Hostel Association operates a
comprehensive network of hostels offering
young people and families a range of
affordable facilities, including self-catering.
‘Leisure parks’ attract over 37 million
visitors a year. Alton Towers (Staffordshire),
Chessington World of Adventures and
Thorpe Park (both in Surrey) are three of the
biggest; 2.78 million people visited Alton
Towers in 1998, the second largest number of
visitors for any paid-for tourist attraction (see
Table 30.5). Legoland near Windsor in
Berkshire is the newest theme park; it
attracted 1.6 million visitors in 1998.
Attractions in these parks include spectacular
‘white knuckle’ rides and overhead cable cars
and railways, while some parks also feature
domesticated and wild animals.
Tourism Promotion
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for tourism in England,
and the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly
and Northern Ireland Offices have
responsibility for tourism in their respective
countries. The government-supported British
Tourist Authority (BTA)—which is receiving
£35 million in grant in 1999-2000—boosts
tourism spending in Britain by focusing its
marketing resources on 27 key markets
worldwide (which in total generate 90% of all
visitors to Britain) and encourages the
development of tourist facilities in the UK to
meet the needs of overseas visitors. The
tourist bodies for England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, which also receive
government finance, support domestic
tourism and work with the BTA to promote
Britain overseas. In July 1999, the English
Tourism Council (ETC) replaced the English

Tourist Board. The ETC is responsible for
developing and promoting a sustainable and
competitive industry in England.
The Government is working with the
tourism industry to raise standards of
accommodation and service, and to address
certain key issues facing the industry. These
include its communications strategy;
improving visitor attractions; boosting business
tourism; encouraging best practice for the
development of workforce skills; and
government-industry communication. The
Government is also considering how best to
support tourism growth which is economically,
socially and environmentally sustainable. The
BTA and the national tourist boards inform
and advise the Government on issues of
concern to the industry. They also help
businesses and other organisations to plan by
researching and publicising trends affecting
the industry. The national tourist boards work
closely with regional tourist boards, on which
local government and business interests are
represented. There are about 800 local Tourist
Information Centres in the UK.
Accommodation classification and quality
grading schemes are operated by the national
tourist boards in conjunction with motoring
organisations such as the AA and RAC.
EXHIBITION AND CONFERENCE
CENTRES
The UK is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—the
others being the United States and France.
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. Other British towns and
cities—including several traditional seaside
holiday resorts diversifying to take advantage
of the growing business tourism market—have
conference and exhibition facilities.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London; Cardiff International Arena, a 5,000-
seat multi-purpose facility; and the Belfast
Waterfront Hall. In Scotland, Edinburgh,
Glasgow and Aberdeen have major exhibition
and conference centres. Brighton (East
Sussex), Harrogate (North Yorkshire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Manchester,
Nottingham and Torquay (Devon) all have
exhibition and conference centres. Other
important exhibition facilities in London are
at the Barbican, Earls Court, Alexandra Palace
and Wembley Arena.
528
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
RENTAL SERVICES
A varied range of rental services, many
franchised, are available throughout the UK.
These include hire of cars and other vehicles;
televisions, video recorders and camcorders;
household appliances such as washing
machines; tools and heavy decorating
equipment (such as ladders and floor sanders);
and video films and computer games. Retailing
of many types of service is dominated by
chains, although independent operators are
still to be found in most fields. In addition,
there is a thriving sector renting to
businesses—all sorts of machinery and other
types of equipment, together with computers
and other office appliances. In 1998 turnover
of the rental sector amounted to £14.2 billion.
COMPUTING SERVICES
The computing services industry comprises
businesses engaged in software development;
systems integration; IT consultancy; IT
‘outsourcing’; processing services; and the
provision of complete computer systems. It
also includes companies that provide IT
education and training; independent
maintenance; support, contingency planning
and recruitment; and contract staff. Turnover
of companies in this sector amounted to
nearly £35 billion in 1998, 17% higher than
in 1997.
British firms and universities have
established strong reputations in software
R&D. A number of international IT
conglomerates have set up R&D operations in
the UK—among them are Hitachi, IBM,
Nortel, Philips and Sharp. US software
company Computer Associates is building a
new £100 million European headquarters at
Datchet, near Heathrow Airport. Microsoft
has made a major R&D investment at
Cambridge and Sun Microsystems will be
opening a new corporate headquarters in
summer 2000. Academic expertise is especially
evident in such areas as artificial intelligence,
neural networks, formal programming for
safety critical systems, and parallel
programming systems.
Software firms have developed strengths in
sector-specific applications, including systems
for retailing, banking, finance and accounting,
medical and dental industries, and the travel
and entertainment industries. For example,
Misys is a market leader in financial services
software, and Sage in accounting and payroll
software. Specialist ‘niche’ markets in which
UK software producers are active include
artificial intelligence, scientific and
engineering software (especially computer-
aided design), mathematical software,
geographical information systems, and data
visualisation packages. Some firms specialise
in devising multimedia software. Distance
learning, ‘virtual reality’ and computer
animation all benefit from a large pool of
creative talent.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry (see p. 479). The
provision of almost all new telecommunications
services, including switching and transmission,
is dependent on software.
MARKET RESEARCH
The UK’s market research profession has
grown strongly in the last five years and there
are now over 500 companies, with a total UK
revenue of over £1 billion a year. UK-owned
market research companies include the
largest international customised market
research specialists. Well-known names
include TaylorNelson Sofres, Research
International, NOP, Millward Brown and
MORI.
MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY
The UK’s 35,000 management consultants
supply technical assistance and advice to
business and government clients. The 32
members of the Management Consultancies
Association account for more than half of
management consultancy work carried out
in the UK. The largest consultancy firms
include Andersen Consulting, CMG
Management, CSC, Deloitte & Touche,
Ernst & Young, KPMG, PA Consulting,
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Serna. In 1998
member firms earned £5.5 billion in the UK
and £1 billion abroad.
529
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
ADVERTISING AND PUBLIC
RELATIONS
The UK is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in the UK for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Advertising expenditure in the UK increased
by 7.7% to £14.3 billion in 1998. The press
accounted for 52% of the total, television for
28%, direct mail for 12%, and posters,
transport, commercial radio and cinema for
the rest. The largest advertising expenditure is
on food, household durables, cosmetics, office
equipment, motor vehicles and financial
services. Among the biggest spenders in 1998
were BT, Dixons, Procter and Gamble,
Kellogg, Unilever, Cable & Wireless, the
major car manufacturers and the Government.
British television advertising receives many
international awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 1,100
advertising agencies. Leading agencies include
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, J. Walter
Thompson, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Ogilvy and
Mather. In addition to their creative,
production and media-buying roles, some
agencies offer integrated marketing services,
including consumer research and public
relations. Many agencies have sponsorship
departments, which arrange for businesses to
sponsor products and events, including
artistic, sporting and charitable events. In
return for financial or other support, the
sponsoring company is associated with a
worthy product or occasion, thereby raising its
profile with consumers.
Government advertising campaigns—on
crime prevention, health promotion, armed
services recruitment and so on—are often
organised by the Central Office of
Information, an executive agency of the
Government.
The UK’s public relations industry has
developed rapidly, and there are now many
small specialist firms as well as some quite large
ones, such as Shandwick and Citigate Dewe
Rogerson. About 26% of the earnings of UK
public relations firms represents overseas work.
BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES
One of the major growth areas in the services
sector is in support services, reflecting the
trend among more and more firms to
‘outsource’ non-core operations. Initially,
operating areas which were outsourced or
contracted out were in cleaning, security and
catering. However, firms are now outsourcing
other activities, such as IT and personnel
support services. A study for the DTI in 1996
found that the annual turnover of business
support services in the UK was around £10
billion, and the sector employed 675,000
people. Turnover in the business services
sector has risen by around 10% a year since
1996. Among the largest firms providing these
services are Rentokil Initial, DCS Group,
Hays and Serco Group.

For 50 years this
comprehensive
yearbook has kept
readers up to date
with the ever
changing
structure and
! organisation of the
v. United Kingdom,
becoming an
essential addition
to bookshelves in schools and universities,
libraries and homes, and for businesses
and researchers across the world.

The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom
Britain 2000 is the only place you'll find the
complete background to 'how Britain
works' and a description of current
government policy in every area of the
nation's life, from the economy, trade,
industry, energy, science and public finance
to the media, culture, justice, health,
environmental protection and religion.
It also describes the emerging effects of
devolution in Scotland and Wales. The
book is full of facts and figures, pictures
and lists, tables, maps and charts.
The 2000 edition of the yearbook opens
with a summary of the millennial
celebrations planned in the UK. Thereafter
the book has a number of comparisons
with the state of the nation around the end
of the 19th century — to show how things
have changed in the past 100 years (or not,
as the case may be) and to mark the end
of the century.
