INTRODUCTION
Britain: AN official handbook, 1961, is the twelfth in the series
prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other Government
departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided
by the British Information Services in many countries, was at first only
available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954 it was placed on sale
throughout the world and it has since become widely known as an established
work of reference.
Britain: an official handbook, 1961, which covers events up to
September i960, gives, like its predecessors, a factual account of the admini¬
stration and the national economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the
activities of many of the national institutions, both official and unofficial, and
shows the part played by the Government in the life of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt to
cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The factual
and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and other
authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to the
United Kingdom as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland are also given separately when these are available.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the
Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by
the Central Statistical Office, and also other Government publications and
standard works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography
at the end of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central
Office of Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free
and marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at United
Kingdom Information Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in
the United Kingdom from the Reference Division, Central Office of
Information, on payment of a small charge.

I. THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with a total
area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great Britain proper
(comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (comprising
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of England is the
Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is
Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are
the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative
counties or parts of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea
and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern
Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), has a total
area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into 40 geographical
or 49 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouthshire), with a total area of
8,017 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland, including its 186 inhabited islands, has
a total area of 30,411 square miles and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland,
consisting of six counties, has a total area of 5,459 square miles. Together, these
countries constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with a
total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom (excluding
inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England, 50,051; Wales and Monmouthshire,
7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland, 5,206 square miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they refer to
England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for many
administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole. The position is further
complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with
England. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle of
Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles, which are strictly
not part of the United Kingdom, but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern
Ireland became independent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles
as a whole. ,
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British mainland
(the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the Shetland^ Islands.
The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head, near John o’ Groats,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45 East
and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately 10 30 West. It is just under
600 miles in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and
rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays and
inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
1

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less than
50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the north¬
west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet to 3,000
feet. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal
movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Geology and Topography
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main geological
periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant to weather, and
have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south and east, and the island
can therefore be divided roughly into two main regions, Lowland Britain and Highland
Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern England
have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and rising to chalk
and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet above sea level. The
boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth of the Tyne in the north-east
of England to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and moors
of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands, which
extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the Lake District
in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the Pennines, almost the
whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of England coinciding approximately
with the counties of Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain contains all the mountain¬
ous parts1 of Great Britain and extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This
high ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks
(archaean and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly
more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures which
have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops and shallow
seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found on the edge of the
plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the present deep coal
workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of present-
day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and at one period
or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line joining the river Thames
and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally
accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern
England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that,
when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay dis¬
tributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous drainage
1The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon, 3,560 feet;
and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet. The highest peak
in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of
sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by the ice
sheets the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the previous
natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly placed
around central lowlands; in the higher parts the moorland vegetation resembles that
of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety of scenery
and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, particularly on the coasts.
The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach the coast in towering cliffs; else¬
where the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along much of the west coast of Scotland.
Bold outstanding headlands are notable features in other parts of the varied coastline:
the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire
coast in South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides.
Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white
limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline have
beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the Humber and the
Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches
of it have been protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally
been breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the sand
and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short British rivers1
valuable as natural harbours.
Climate
Britain has a temperate and equable climate. It lies in middle latitudes to the north¬
west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but as the prevailing winds are south¬
westerly the climate is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic, although
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry, continental
type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days or even weeks.
The weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from
the Atlantic which, moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over
or near the British Isles. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and the
depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the north of the
British Isles.
Winds. In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-westerly
ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the spring than at any
other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local topography. Winds are generally stronger in the north
than in the south of the British Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger
in the west than in the east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the
average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames are only 210 and 200 miles
long respectively.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

to about 14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about 7 m.p.h.
in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the north-west coast with
over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east Midlands are the least stormy,
with gales occurring on about 2 days a year inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the
Channel coast.
Temperature. Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from 470 F. in the
Hebrides to 52° F. in the extreme south-west of England; it is slightly lower in the
eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The mean monthly temperature in
the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 390 F. during the winter
('December, January and February) to 530 F. during the summer (June, July and
August): the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south,
are 430 F. and 63° F. The average range of temperature between winter and summer
varies from 150 F. to 230 F., being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 8o° F. in the south,
but temperatures of 90° F. and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum temperatures
depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 20° F. may occur on a still, clear
winter’s night, io° F. is rare, and o° F. or below has been recorded only during
exceptionally severe winter periods.
Rainfall. The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual rainfall
is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas
of the west and north having far more rain than the plains of the south and east.
Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis
during the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but, on the average,
March to June are the driest months and October to January the wettest, the former
period of four months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period
of as long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited
areas. The summer of 1959, however, was unusually dry and sunny from May to
September, and many areas, especially in southern, central and eastern England,
enjoyed spells of fine rainless weather lasting three weeks or more, particularly in
September.
Sunshine. The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general
decrease from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western Scotland to seven
and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England; during the months of shortest
daylight—November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an
average of half an hour a day in the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
Soil and Vegetation
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with the
result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland, the
Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east and
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valley lands and
the plains where soils are deeper and richer; villages and towns are often separated
by uplands with few if any habitations.
6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the whole of
Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except where there
are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage systems have been
developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil of the
low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and similar areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered the greater
part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests of Scots pine on
higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland. In the course of the
centuries the forest area was progressively diminished and, in spite of planting by estate
owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the establishment of large
forests by the Forestry Commission in the past forty years, woodlands now occupy
only about 7 per cent of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland
occurs in the north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in
Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be well wooded
because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are
oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of woods, fens
and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher slopes of mountains;
the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country, which consists mainly of
heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton grass in the wetter parts. Most of
Britain, however, is agricultural land, of which about a third is arable and the rest
pasture and meadow, a varied semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses
and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges or stone walls and, especially in the
mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a pattern of contrasting colour.
The cool temperate climate of Britain and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a
long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grassland is green throughout the year and
full of wild flowers from spring to autumn; there is scarcely a month in which some
flowers may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
Fauna
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western Europe,
though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, including the wolf, the
bear, the boar and the Irish elk, have become extinct; but red deer, protected for
sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on Exmoor in the counties
of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of
southern England, and fallow deer (which are not indigenous) have been introduced
into parks and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely
seen; there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and
streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast, though
not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles, shrews,
hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey more numerous than the native red),
hares, rabbits (a serious farming pest before their decimation by myxomatosis in the
years 1954 and 1955), weasels and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About 230 species
are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The chaffinch and the blackbird
are probably the most numerous and are widely and evenly distributed, but sparrows
usually predominate near houses, and huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain
seasons, sometimes congregate in London and other large towns. In general, the
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
7
number of small birds has been on the increase for several decades owing to their success
in adapting themselves to a man-made environment and also to their more considerate
treatment by the public. The number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to
decline, except for game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and
partridges, and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
The many species of gulls and other sea-birds which nest round the coast often fly
far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage and reclamation
of marsh lands have diminished the natural habitat of duck, geese and other aquatic
birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs, gravel pits and sewage farms
in addition to the nature reserves and bird sanctuaries which the Government is
establishing on an increasing scale. Many of the rarer species of birds are protected
by law.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three species of
snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of lizards, including
the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented by three species of newts
and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only one species of newt and the common
viviparous lizard are indigenous; the other species of reptiles and amphibians that are
now firmly established came to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace, grayling
and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small, in the
British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to 4 inches) and
the stag beetle (2^ inches). The insect fauna in Britain is less varied than that of
continental Europe and lacks a number of common European species. With modern
methods of pest control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious
outbreaks of diseases commonly spread by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling in
northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French language
and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the relative
importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and
the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots,
Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of England and the Lowlands
of Scotland the language which soon came to predominate was English, mainly a
marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages
persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in
Ireland (see p. 19).
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of population
or of the extent or direction of population movement until the beginning of the
nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end of the eleventh century the
population of Great Britain was about two million, while at the end of the seventeenth
century a reasonable contemporary estimate put the population of England and Wales
at 5^ million and that of Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual
growth of population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by high death
rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration
from the continent of Europe was an influence at certain times, for example, that of
Flemish weavers in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British people
—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, marriages, occupa¬
tions, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and reliable. Most of it
is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital statistics, i.e. statistical
information based on statutory registration of births, marriages and deaths, and the
periodic census of population which gives a national snapshot at a particular moment
of time.
The Compilation of Vital Statistics
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is carried out
by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as registrars of marriages.
In England and Wales, there are about five hundred superintendent registrars in charge
of registration districts and about twelve hundred registrars in charge of sub-districts.
Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed by the county, county borough
and metropolitan borough councils but they act under the instruction of the Registrar
General for England and Wales, who is in charge of a central Government department,
the General Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of births,'
deaths and marriages, with planning and carrying out population censuses, and with
the compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There are corresponding
authorities1 and similar arrangements (differing only in detail) in Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
In England and Wales, the legal obligations in connection with the registration of
births, marriages and deaths are as follows. The responsibility for giving information
to a local registrar about a birth is placed first on the parents of the child (the mother
where the child is illegitimate), then on the occupier of the house and any person
present at the birth, on the person in charge of the child or on any person finding a
new-born child. Similarly, information for the registration of a death must be given
by a relative present at the death or in attendance during the last illness or, in their
absence, by any other relative residing or being in the sub-district where the death
occurred, by the occupier or an inmate of the house or by any person finding or taking
charge of the body or arranging for its disposal. The doctor who attended the deceased
during his last illness must issue a certificate giving the cause of death and deliver it at
once to the registrar. Deaths of persons not receiving medical attention, deaths the
cause of which is unknown and unnatural, and accidental or violent deaths must be
reported to a coroner (see p. 89).
Marriages are registered immediately after the ceremony. In general, marriages
according to religious rites are entered in registers held by the officiating clergyman or
some other person appointed by the religious body concerned. Some religious marriages,
and all civil marriages (which are solemnised in superintendent registrars’ offices) are
attended and registered by registrars of marriages.
Certified copies of all entries of births, deaths and marriages are sent quarterly to
the General Register Office.
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London- the
General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of Finance
of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey, of Guernsey and its
associated islands, and of the Isle of Man. J
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

In Scotland, there are no superintendent registrars but for each of nearly 1,000
registration districts there is a registrar of births, deaths and marriages. Some 300 of
these registrars may conduct civil marriages in their offices. Duplicate registers are
transmitted annually to the Registrar for Scotland after inspection by district examiners.
In the 184 registration districts of Northern Ireland, only live births are registered
(whereas both live and still births are registered in Great Britain) and certain supple¬
mentary information (collected in Great Britain primarily for fertility studies) is not
required. Roman Catholic marriages in Northern Ireland are registered on the authority
of a certificate completed at the time of the ceremony, instead of being recorded in a
bound register immediately the ceremony is over.
The Census
Censuses of the people of Great Britain were taken regularly every ten years from
1801 to 1931. There was no census between 1931 and 1951, but a count of the population
by age and sex was a by-product of the national registration which was instituted at
the outbreak of the second world war in September 1939.
Censuses were taken on 8th April, 1951> appropriate authorities in the
United Kingdom, the islands of the British seas and the Irish Republic. This was the
first simultaneous population count covering all these areas since the censuses of 1911.
The co-operation of the Irish Republic in arranging a simultaneous census was of
particular value, owing to the considerable sea and land traffic and the movement of
population between that country and the United Kingdom. All the reports based
on these censuses have now been published. The next census will be taken on
23rd April, 1961. _ • • 1 • 1
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births, marriages and
deaths, though some use has been made of other special investigations, including the
Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.1
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
8th April, 1951, was, to the nearest thousand, 50,225,000, excluding 158,000 persons in
the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the
United Kingdom.
The population had increased by about 2^ million since mid-i939> ^out 4 million
since 1931, by about 6 million since 1921 and by about 43 million—or about sevenfold
 since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive reduction in death
rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning of the twentieth century.
The population is still increasing, though relatively slowly, and at mid-1959 the home
population of the United Kingdom (i.e. those people actually in the United Kingdom
at that time) was estimated at 51,985,000.
The population density of the United Kingdom is one of the highest in the world.
It was approximately 533 persons per square mile at the time of the 1951 censuses,
and had risen to 552 persons per square mile at mid-1959.
Birth and Death Rates. For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate
was about 35 per thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over
20 per thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from 12 per
thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand in 1901.
iThis commission was appointed in March 1944; its main report was published in March 1949.

After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth-century

rose more rapidly (see diagram below). S g g

of the expectation of life from about 50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910 to about 70
years at birth in 1955 to 1957. From 1933 onwards the birth rate steadied itself up to
the outbreak of the second world war, after which all orderly movement was inter¬
rupted by the disturbed conditions of the war years. The 1947 birth rate (20-7 per
thousand of the population) was the highest since 1921, but the 1948, 1949, 1950 and
1951 birth rates were progressively lower, though higher than pre-war. From 1951 to
1956, the birth rate remained fairly steady and slightly higher than before the war, at
about 15! to 16 per thousand of the population; since 1956 it has risen, and was 16-9
per thousand in 1959.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH ™ars
Mortality Causes: The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally available,
and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers and
enabled them to take greater care of their children.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant and
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute infectious
lesTthan rl1S ^ 0ne-hundredth and mortality from tuberculosis is
mnrf one^hlrt^eth of the mte prevailing in the mid-nineteenth century. Infant

hllvpH S ^ Cent Siri90°- BetWeen 1934 and 1942 maternal mortality was nearly
halved, and is now only about one-seventh of the 1934 rate. The reported mortality
from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age, such as cancer of the lung and
coronary thrombosis, has risen during the twentieth century, and this rise, though
xaggerated by the improvement m diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not
yet discovered effective measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement
m positive health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
F^ty Trends: The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and
Jhe W3! Pr °i hG t™tiefthucfnturies waa due mainly to a decline in the size of
of delih 7 (/-e;the ™mber of chddren born married couple) caused by the spread
berate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced on
the average rather more than six hveborn children. The decline seenis to have set in
"T mamed 'n the l86os; and contmued steadily until, with the couples married
in the late 1920s, the average family size had been reduced to between 2-2 and 2-1
The deChne then stopped, and the figure has remained stable in spite of the disturbance
of the war years; the latest data suggest a slight increase.

years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to replace the original
generation, while those born at the beginning of the present century had only about
has^ee °f thC nUmber °f chlldren necded for replacement. Since then the figure
has been rising again and may reach full replacement with the generation born during
the second world war. But the rise has been due more to the increased proportion of
increase in^arrfily size. ^ ^ °f ^ than to the smal1
,At jrSt,thC deC}me in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 1930 the families of
ZeW ^ 40 f^ largCr than th°Se 0f non-manual workers but
this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family size has
been slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and Wales
Age Distribution: The first effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the
potation ThifrTtio"^ ^ ^ °f dependent Population to working
population. This ratio was at a minimum in the 1930s. After 1936 the number of
t “"hf 00 ^ °Wing t0 'he dr°P ” the bi«h Ster
1,' f ‘ population aged over 40 continued to increase and the population
tfons ofesrtei,l • 8 u ^ ^ and representing successive genera¬
tions of steeply rising numbers, increased very rapidly. The higher birth rates after
.94a have arrested the compensating fall in the number of depidem chiUr?nt,d
have further reduced the ratio of working to dependent population.
At mid-i959 the age distribution of the United Kingdom was estimated as follows:
Under 15 .. .. .. 23-3 per cent
to b4 65-1 per cent
65 and over .. .. n-h per cent
An unusually large proportion of the population of the United Kingdom (about
4 per cent) is now between 45 and 55 years of age. Assuming a continued fall in
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!3
death rates and net emigration of 27,000 people a year from the usual age groups, it
can be estimated that between 1959 and 1974:
(1) the number of young people aged 15 to 24 will increase by nearly 15 per cent
to about 7! million;
(2) the population of working age will increase slowly;
(3) the number of old people (over 65) will increase by more than i| million.
Sex Ratio: Total live births of boys currently exceed those of girls by about 6 per
cent, but owing to the higher infant mortality rate among boys, and the higher male
death rates in all age groups, women have, until recently, outnumbered men in every
age group from adolescence onwards and in the total population. Their predominance
increases with age and is now over 60 per cent among persons over 70 years of age.
The fall in mortality has affected the sex ratio by increasing the proportion of old
persons in both sexes, which has made female predominance in those age groups a
weightier factor in the sex ratio of the population as a whole. At the same time there
has been a slight rise in the proportion of boys among children under 15 years of age,
and the ages at which males outnumber females extend beyond adolescence well into
the adult ages. There is thus no longer a surplus of women at the usual ages of marriage.
The proportion of females to males in the total population has not varied greatly,
however, as these two effects have counterbalanced each other. At present there are
between six and seven per cent more females than males.
Migration: Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, net migration has been
markedly outward. In that period, about 25 million persons born in the British Isles
are estimated to have emigrated to the United States and Commonwealth countries
overseas. On the other hand, large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles,
Germans and Hungarians, have entered the British Isles during the last 80 years.
The net loss by migration since 1871 from the present area of the United Kingdom is
about 3^ million. During the inter-censal period 1931-51 the balance of migration to
and from the United Kingdom was inward for the first time in the past century. The
net gain to the United Kingdom from civilian migration was about half a million, a
net gain of three-quarters of a million to England and Wales being offset by net
losses from Scotland and Northern Ireland. This net gain was the balance between a
large outward movement mainly of British subjects emigrating to Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and South Africa, and a larger inward movement consisting chiefly of
British subjects returning home during the 1930s and of aliens from Europe, including
about a quarter of a million refugees1 seeking sanctuary in Britain. There was also
considerable net immigration from the Irish Republic. Taking only the period 1946-51
the balance of migration by sea (figures for air transport are not available) was outward
owing to the high net outflow (some 65,000 a year) to Commonwealth countries over¬
seas. In 1952 this net outflow reached a peak of 87,000, but it was subsequently reduced,
chiefly owing to increased immigration into Britain from other parts of the Common¬
wealth, particularly the West Indies, and the total balance of migration to and from
all countries for the years 1952 to 1956 was certainly small. Exceptionally high migration
began towards the end of 1956, partly due to a sudden surge in the flow of emigration
to Canada, and also to an influx of British repatriates from Egypt, and of some 21,000
Hungarian refugees,1 of whom over 14,000 have remained in Britain. In 195? gross
irrhe total number of refugees who have come to Britain in the past twenty-five years has been
estimated at about 330,000, of whom 80,000 came before the second world war.

Regional Distribution and Trends
The distribution of the population of the British Isles by country and major adminis¬
trative region as enumerated at the 1951 censuses, at certain previous censuses back to
1841, and as estimated at mid-1959, is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each of
the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1959 than in 1951 and
in 1951 than in 1931, whereas in the period 1921-31 the populations of Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland had declined. Between 1931 and 1951, the greatest increases
were in the eastern, southern, midland and south-western regions of England, and in
Northern Ireland. The smallest increase was in Wales. Since 1951 the main increases
have been in the eastern, southern and north midland regions of England.
The population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the urban
element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of the nine¬
teenth century, 75 per cent of the British population was living within the boundaries
of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation1 was already the dominant
type of British community. By 1911, the economic and social limits of these conurba¬
tions extended far beyond the administrative boundaries of the cities which formed
their core, owing to the building of outer suburbs which linked up neighbouring towns.
Since 1921, nearly 40 per cent of the population has lived in the seven great conurba¬
tions whose centres are the cities of London, Manchester (South East Lancashire),
Birmingham and Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside),
Leeds and Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne (see Table 2, pp. 17-18).
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the popula¬
tion of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people had
returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. At the 1951 census many
large cities and towns had larger populations than in 1939, but the population of others
was smaller. Table 2 shows the distribution of the population by urban and rural
districts and the populations of the standard administrative regions, of the seven
major conurbations and the 17 large cities, some of which are the principal cities
included in the conurbations. It should be borne in mind, however, that the statistics
of cities, relating to administrative areas, do not necessarily include all the con¬
tinuously built-up area of the city; in the case of large towns, development commonly
extends without a break across administrative boundaries. The statistics for conurba¬
tions, which consist of continuously built up and economically inter-dependent areas
and include developing suburbs of large cities, are in some cases more illuminating.
The greatest concentration of population in Britain is in the London area. The
precise definition of Greater London is a matter of opinion, but it certainly covers an
area much larger than the County of London (population about 3 million). The con¬
tinuously built-up area extends into the counties of Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Surrey,
Essex and Kent, and the area socially and economically dependent on the capital is
still wider. As in other urban concentrations, there is a long-established tendency for
decreases in the number of people who actually have their homes in the inner parts
of the area—especially the centre itself—to be balanced by increases of population in
1 An area of urban development where a number of separate towns have grown into each other
or become linked by such factors as a common industrial or business interest or a common
centre for shopping or education.

and beyond the outer suburban fringes. The war accelerated the pre-war fall of
population in the inner areas and retarded the rapid pre-war expansion of some of the
outer areas. Between 1939 and 1951 the County of London lost about two-thirds
of a million people and the official conurbation, which roughly corresponds to the
continuously built-up area, fell by some 380,000 to 8,350,000 in 1951.
During the 1950s, the population of the inner areas has continued to fall; and this
has been accompanied by significant increases throughout a wide area beyond the
official conurbation. A broad belt of almost continuous population increase now
surrounds the conurbation and is estimated to contain about 20 per cent more people
than in 1951. It completely encircles London, includes and passes beyond all the
London new towns and extends along every major road and rail route from London.
The contemporary London Region can be defined as a roughly circular area with a
radius of 40 to 50 miles from central London and a population in i960 of some
12,000,000. The population of the region has grown by only about half a million, or
4 per cent, since 1951. This rise is mainly due to natural increase (excess of births over
deaths) and the changes in population are essentially attributable to redistribution
rather than to a net immigration from beyond the region. This redistribution has
resulted both from voluntary or private moves and planned transfers of population.
The increased population of the outer areas includes both commuters who have moved
their homes but continue to travel to work in inner London, and inhabitants of new
towns and expanded existing towns who have changed both their home and their
workplace.
These changes, particularly the spread of commuter populations, have been facili¬
tated and encouraged by progress in transport—electrification and diesel developments
on the railways and the greatly increased number of private cars.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!9
The characteristic of urban dispersal which has reached its largest scale in the London
area, has been a feature of post-war change also in many provincial cities and towns.
It has been most marked where the local economy has been prosperous, population
increase rapid, and land for development in short supply. Outward movement and
fringe development for one or more of these reasons has been noticeably large in outer
areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside conurbations and on the edges of Bristol,
Derby, Leicester, Norwich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
Apart from the feature of urban dispersal, the 1950s have seen widely different
rates of population growth in various parts of the country. The general picture is that
many places in the Midlands and south-east England and those in economically
prosperous parts of the north and west have experienced increase above the national
rate; they include in particular the London, Birmingham and Southampton-Portsmouth
areas, Coventry, Oxford, Gloucester-Cheltenham, Bournemouth, Middlesbrough,
Doncaster and York. There was comparatively little increase or no change in the South-
East Lancashire, West Yorkshire, and Tyneside conurbations. Few places had any
decrease of population; it was generally small in amount and affected mainly some old
industrial areas in Lancashire and south Wales and a number of seaside towns. Rural
districts, in total, had a high rate of increase, but this was due largely to expansion on
town peripheries.
Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of the majority of the population in most of the western counties and was
spoken by 29 per cent of the population at the time of the 1951 census. In Scotland,
in 1951, nearly 100,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll,
and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic1, while a few families in Northern
Ireland spoke the Irish fo*m of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic
are no longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is
spoken by a few people, and is used in addition to English for certain official
p renouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French patois
is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official language of Jersey,
used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French and English are used in the
courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used for almost all official proceedings.
SOCIAL PATTERNS
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful, however,
to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British households and
the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a background to the informa¬
tion given in later chapters on such matters as town planning, housing, and transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumerated
by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions such as hotels, schools,
and hospitals.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included in the
counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.
20
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1911 there were about nine million private households1 in Great Britain. By
1951, according to the censuses of England and Wales, and of Scotland, there were
about 14^ million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion, so
much more rapid than the 19 per cent increase in the total population for the same
period, was, in fact, of the same order as the increases in the numbers of persons over
24 years old and of married persons. In other words, the increasing age of the popula¬
tion meant more but smaller families. The average size of households in Great Britain
fell from 4.5 persons in 1911 to 3-2 in 1951. In England and Wales the number of
persons living in households of one or two persons almost trebled between 1911 and
I95I- the; end of this period such households constituted about 40 per cent of private
households and comprised about 20 per cent of the population in private households.
In 43 per cent of families of two persons, the head of the household was 60 years of
age or over.
It has been difficult to increase the number of separate dwelling-places (houses
or flats) sufficiently rapidly to overtake the increasing number of private households,
and this difficulty was aggravated by the suspension of house-building and the
destruction of property during the second world war. In 19515 there were only some
I3‘7 million structurally separate dwelling-places in Great Britain, and about 2 million
households shared a home. About 70 per cent of the dwellings were houses of four to
six rooms (mainly terraced or semi-detached houses), while 20 per cent were of three
rooms or less (mainly flats). The proportion of small dwellings was greatly above
average in Scotland, where there were many slum tenements, and considerably above
average in London.
Of the 14! million private households in Great Britain in 1951, n| million were
estimated, according to the 1951 census one per cent sample tables (based on an analysis
of a representative one per cent sample of census returns in Great Britain), to be of the
simplest type, comprising married couples or widowed persons with their children,
if any, or persons living alone. More specifically, they comprised 3-2 million married
couples with no children, 900,000 widowed persons living alone, 6-9 million married
couples or widowed persons with children of any age, 600,000 single persons living alone.
Over a third of all married couples living alone were 60 years old or over; less than
a quarter of the married couples under 40 years of age in these simplest types of
household had no children. Some three-quarters of the single persons living alone and
almost all widowed and divorced persons living alone were over 40 years old, and
about two-thirds of all persons living alone were 60 years of age or over.
Only 2 million households contained persons less closely related to the head than
parent or brother or sister, or contained non-relatives. In nearly half of these house¬
holds, a second family—a married couple or a woman with children—was living with
the first family, usually the parents. Of the remaining 1 • 1 million households which
contained some unrelated or distantly related persons (numbering 1-24 million),
300,000 households consisted of only two persons.
Over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated in the
I95I census sample tables to be without children under 16, while another 3>i million
contained only one child.
It was estimated that in 1951 there were 180,000 households in Great Britain
employing a total of 205,000 resident domestic servants, of whom 178,000 were in
England and Wales. This compares with an estimate of 706,800 resident domestic
servants in England and Wales in 1931.
1 Counting persons living alone as one-person households.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
Over half of the resident domestic servants in 1951 worked in small households
(of not more than three persons including the servant), while more than a quarter
were acting as the sole servant and household companion to one person of over 40
years of age. Already in 1951, a large proportion of resident domestic servants—and
possibly the majority of those working for families with children—were girls from
Ireland or from continental Europe, many of whom were attracted by the opportunity
to see Britain or to learn English. Since 1951, the number of girls from overseas coming
to take resident domestic posts has increased.
In the years since 1951, considerable changes in the numbers, size and composition
of households may have taken place. No firm information on trends is available but,
in view of the extent of house-building and the continued increase in the number of
old people it is likely that the average size of households has continued to decrease.
The small average size of households does not imply that wider family and kinship
ties are without strength and social significance. Indeed, a study, published in 1957,1
stressed the importance of the mutual help of relatives and neighbours in the long-
established and balanced communities living in the more crowded parts of East
London. The survey, which also covered a suburban area of Greater London, noted
the dangers of weakening such ties when households are moved out to more congenial
suburban surroundings.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time gainful
employment. In many cases housewives also undertake part-time or even full¬
time employment. Nearly a third of married women have a paid job, and half the
women working for pay are married.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually from
42 to 46 hours a week. Actual weekly hours worked by men average a little longer owing
to overtime working, and actual hours worked by women and girls average a little less.
In addition, the journey to and from work is often long. The 1951 census showed that
three-quarters of the 1^ million persons working in central London lived outside it
and that many travelled in from the fringes of Greater London and some from farther
away. A sample survey of travel in Greater London, made in i954> showed that 89
per cent of workers in Greater London made regular journeys to work and that 56
per cent used public transport. The average time taken by such persons was 39 minutes
each way, though for workers in central London it was 47 minutes each way. Both the
number of persons travelling daily to work in central London and the average length
of such journeys are tending to increase (see pp. 15 and 18).
There is also often a long journey for housewives to the main shopping centre in
both urban and rural areas. In most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer
at hand.
Probably less than five per cent of housewives employ any paid help and almost
certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant. The statistical evidence on this
matter is rather fragmentary, but suggests a continuing reduction in the number of
households with paid help, and confirms what can in any case be readily deduced from
everyday experience, that housewives have less leisure and considerably fewer periods
of continuous leisure of over one hour than other persons in Britain, in spite of
the growth of the habit of eating some meals away from home and the spread of

labour-saving devices. Two households in every three now have a vacuum cleaner
one in three a washing machine and about one in eight a refrigerator.
Compared with earlier generations, however, most people today have more leisure
In many industries and services, hours of work are usually arranged to give a five’
day week, and most employees are entitled to two weeks’ continuous holiday a year in
addition to the statutory public holidays. About half of the population take at least a
weeks holiday away from home every year, mostly in July and August. Some two-
.bird® these spend their holiday by the sea in Britain. A relatively small but ranidlv
increasing number of holiday-makers go abroad: over three million in 1959, including
travellers to the Channel Islands and to the Irish Republic; in the same year 1 mo oot

gambling with small stakes, which is practised at least occasionally by three adults
out of four is on the results of sporting events, mainly horse and greyhound racing
and football matches (through the football pools, see p. 497). g
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators to the
crowds who go to watch sporting events and great national occasions. By mid-1960
h,me f T i t t I 3” 68 “ Britain (and 3 somewhat higher proportion of the
large families) had a television set; viewers are fairly evenly distributed among all
sections of the population, irrespective of income or occupation. The number of tele¬
vision receiving licences has increased since 1953 from a million to over 10I million
(m mid-1960) and is still increasing rapidly (see p. 478).
Rising standards of living and, in particular, the widely distributed ownership of
television sets and motor vehicles, have affected leisure habits in many ways, both

There were some 8-4 million licensed motor vehicles in the summer of 1959 of
which over 4.9 million were private cars and 1.7 million were motor cycles (including
motor scooters). Many cars and some motor cycles are used partly, if not primarily8
for business purposes. During the summer, however, roads to the sea and the country
and to sporting events are usually thronged (and sometimes jammed) with cars
especially on fine Saturdays and Sundays. The spread of ear ownership, making man;
people more independent of public transport, is leading to a new and more scattered

rapidly both m absolute terms and in relation to the incomes of non-manual workers.

the sons of unskilled workers were themselves in occupations in that category. In
consequence, social distinctions based on occupation have become less clear cut, and
differences in the ways of life of manual and non-manual workers are much less
pronounced. Many manual workers’ families have acquired habits and tastes which
were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’.
Such social changes often call for difficult adjustments. Many families of unskilled
and semi-skilled workers, for example, suddenly find themselves with plenty of money
to spend when their children leave school for work at fifteen years of age; while the
families of most non-manual and many skilled manual workers forgo the extra income
in order to continue their children’s education. The high earnings of young workers,
however, have influenced the status and outlook of adolescents generally. ‘Teenage’
society with sufficient coherence, independence and spending power to establish its
own customs, tastes and fashions is a feature of present-day Britain; and, as in many
other countries, the activities of groups of teenagers without adequate parental control
attract more attention than formerly and are a serious social problem in certain areas.
The chief long-term effects of television, according to recent investigations, are
to widen tastes and stimulate new interests. Another result has been a marked fall in
attendances at cinemas and, to a lesser extent, at football matches, formerly the main
entertainments of large sections of the community. The cinema remains, however, the
most popular form of indoor entertainment outside the home. To young men and
women and older children, cinema-going is a social occasion, and probably at least half
of them go as often as once a week.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller, though most people visit them occasion¬
ally. There are only some 500 theatres in the country compared with some 3,500
cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic and growing public not only for plays
but for ballet, opera and concerts.
Dancing is popular, especially with those under twenty-five years of age, and it is
thought that about five million people go dancing every week. There are estimated to
be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls in the United Kingdom which are open at
least three times a week, and between 4,000 and 5,000 schools of ballroom dancing.
Public dances are also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and societies
which abound in Britain hold dances from time to time in their own or hired premises.
In addition, Scottish and English traditional dances have their own wide and increasing
following, while, since the war, there has been a very large increase in attendance at
ballet and other stage dancing classes (mainly by young girls).
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some particular
purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and international
organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisations of national impor¬
tance in social life and in the promotion of social gatherings include, in addition to
those connected with religious denominations, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes,
the Townswomen’s Guilds and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,500 clubs,
with over two million members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working
Men’s Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational,
though they also arrange lectures and classes. Over 2,200 Townswomen’s Guilds, with
a total membership of about 250,000, are affiliated to the National Union of Towns¬
women’s Guilds. The guilds are both educational and social in purpose, and they
co-operate in many public welfare activities. The declared objective of the National
Federation of Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; the institutes
make an important contribution to rural life by providing meeting places for country¬
women and by organising social gatherings. There are in villages throughout England
B
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
24
and Wales some 8,500 institutes with over 450,000 members, while in Scotland and
Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims and interests.
In spite of the growth of social clubs, one traditional social rendezvous, the public
house, has maintained and even increased its popularity both in towns and in villages,
although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness and in consumption of
alcohol per head since the nineteenth century; the recent rise in drunkenness among
adolescents, though serious, is on a relatively small scale. The public house attracts a
very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women) as well as many regulars ,
who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play some traditional public house
game or to watch television. A rival feature of urban life is the coffee bar. A characteristic
of many of these coffee bars, which stay open until late at night and are popular as a
rendezvous for young people, is their modern decor. On the other hand, many people,
especially the married and the elderly, spend much of their leisure at home—reading,
listening to the radio or gramophone, viewing television, entertaining their friends,1
looking after pets2 and pursuing hobbies. Hobbies are, of course, innumerable in their
variety, but many are practical and contribute to the improvement of the home. About
four out of five families do most of their own decorating, while the sales of hand-tools
and the rapidly increasing sales of small power-tools and powered garden implements
testify to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest
and initiative that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. Even in the towns many
houses have some garden, and the standard of both town and country gardens is
high. It is estimated that there are over 4,000 local horticultural societies in Britain
and probably some 19 million spare-time gardeners. The numerous flower and vege¬
table shows held in town and country are very popular, and there is a large attendance
at those held in London, particularly at the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some form
of sustained group activity connected, for example, with the churches, trade unionism,
politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural pursuits, especially amateur
dramatics and music-making (see the Arts section of Chapter VIII). People with such
interests are still in a minority,3 but they constitute an important and characteristic
feature of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British
democracy.
1 Indications of the rise in the scale and standard of home entertaining are provided by the
increasing sales of table wines (double those of the 1930s) and of expensive foods, and by the
frequent newspaper and periodical features and broadcast programmes devoted to cooking
recipes.
2 A recent sample survey suggests that about a quarter of all homes have a caged bird, slightly
over a fifth have a cat, and slightly under a fifth have a dog; there are probably some 4 million
dogs in Britain, over 6 million cats and 8 or 9 million pet birds (mainly budgerigars).
3 The figures from the Derby Survey showed that eight per cent of adults in that towrn belonged
to intellectual or cultural clubs or societies, eleven per cent were members of some political
party, thirteen per cent went to church every week (9 out of 10 homes had a Bible), and three
per cent held some church office.
II. GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins go back to the ninth
century when all England was unified under a Saxon king. Wales and Ireland became
part of the kingdom before the end of the thirteenth century, and the English and
Scottish thrones were dynastically united in the person of James I and VI in 1603.
In 1707, the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland provided that the two
countries ‘should be forever united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the
Parliament of Great Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801,
the authority of this Parliament was extended to the whole of the United Kingdom by a
provision of the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, 1800, which joined the
Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain. In 1922, the United Kingdom was
diminished by the separation of the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the Irish
Republic). Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, had enacted a constitution
for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland representation in the
United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority and, at the same time, provided
that country with its own legislature and executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal State, but methods of government are
flexible and, to some extent, adapted to individual needs. Thus, there is some measure
of devolution in the administration of Welsh affairs under a Cabinet Minister (who is
Minister for Welsh Affairs) assisted by a Minister of State, and advised by a Council
for Wales as broadly representative as possible of all the main aspects of Welsh life
and thought. Scotland, although it has no separate Parliament, has its own system of
laws, its own courts, its own established church, its own educational system and its
own Government departments under the direction of the Secretary of State for Scotland,
who is a member of the United Kingdom Cabinet. The Northern Ireland Government
departments are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not part of the United Kingdom)
have their own legislative assemblies and systems of local administration and of law,
and their own courts. At the same time, they have a special relationship with the
United Kingdom because of their proximity to the mainland and the antiquity of their
connection with the Crown. They are treated as part of the mainland for purposes of
trade and postal communication and are ‘territories for whose international relations
Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’. They are also formally subject to the United
Kingdom Parliament.
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the good govern¬
ment of a number of overseas dependencies within the Commonwealth, all of which
are administered by territorial governments and are at various stages of development
towards full self-government. The United Kingdom is also one of the independent
member nations of the Commonwealth, which all acknowledge the Queen as the
symbol of their free association and, as such, the head of the Commonwealth; several
of these independent countries, in addition, owe allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions, which are not part
25
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the law of the land in that violation of them may lead to proceedings in a court
of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable to the machinery of government. The
rules of the constitution have never been codified; principles and practice are both
alterable, and the rules of the constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at
any time by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by the general acceptance of a new
convention, without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable, although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
(1) the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the supreme
authority in the realm;
(2) the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other Ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(b) Government departments, most of them under the control of ministers,
and all staffed by civil servants, who are responsible for administration at
the national level; (c) local authorities, who administer and manage many
services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards, which are severally
responsible for the operation of particular nationalised industries or public
services, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying degrees; and
(3) the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive.
This chapter will describe these three organs of government in some detail in order
to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which
it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of the
Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the year 829.
According to the Royal Titles Act, 1953, the royal title in the United Kingdom is:
‘ Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’. The form of the royal title is varied for the
other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crowm, to
suit the particular circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being represented
by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of royal functions in the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance
to the Crown, the Queen’s representative is the Governor-General, who is appointed
by the Crown on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly
independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom depen¬
dencies, the Queen is usually represented by Governors (but in some cases by High
Commissioners, Administrators or Residents), who are appointed by the Crown, have
varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom
Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which provided
that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent Princess

Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succession to the
Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is not bound to
continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision of the Statute
of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide that
the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne according to their
seniority, or, if there are no sons, the daughters in order of their seniority. When a
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and the powers of the Crown are
vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the
consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not
apply, and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in London of
the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in substance
for nearly a thousand years, although the details have frequently been modified to
bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The service used at the coronation
of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was derived from that used at the coronation of King
Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the peers, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Commonwealth
countries, and of representatives of foreign States.
Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the executive,
an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales,
Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of England. In practice,
as a result of a long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the
monarchy has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her
ministers which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule.
The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of
the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
1 The Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I.
GOVERNMENT
29
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule she
opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may be read by
the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and she must give Royal
Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes
a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’, and as such, can show mercy
to or pardon people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers
peerages, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appointments to all important
State offices, including those of judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, and
diplomats, and to all leading positions in the established Church of England. The
Queen’s consent and approval are required before a minister can take up office or a
Cabinet be formed. In the realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence
as head of the State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept
territory, to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal prerogative,2
which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally left in the
hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of this authority is
shown in the three ways in which the royal will can, constitutionally, be expressed:
by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy Council’; by Order,
Commission or Warrant signed personally by the Queen and generally bearing the
signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters
Patent, or other documents under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in
obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not detract
from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth working of
government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and must show
complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and consulted on
every aspect of the national life. The Queen holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and overseas,
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State
papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign
is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne.
The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—Hid down that the first potential
Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter the Princess Margaret and
then those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign s
partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Coun¬
sellors of State (generally speaking, the wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four
adult persons next in succession to the Crown3) to whom the Sovereign may delegate
by Letters Patent certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance,
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a f_ew>
i.e. the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most
Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle, are
conferred by the Sovereign personally.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter; the
construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants and persons of unsound
mind; the administration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, e.g., markets, terries and
fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and the sole right of printing or licensing others to print
the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
3 The Regency Act, 1953, provided that Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), nor
create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles, and in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of
both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same today
as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and
royal funerals are still marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree than
in former days; and the birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many
royal and public functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping
the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade. State banquets still take place when a foreign
monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are still held at
Buckingham Palace; and royal processions continue to grace such social occasions
as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and to add significance to the
opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances, ancient
usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other members of the
royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every year, and their presence at
the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support. They also pay State visits to
foreign Governments and undertake lengthy tours in other countries of the
Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in Parliament,
that is to say the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House of Lords and
the elected House of Commons.
The three sections of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are constituted on
different principles; they do different work in different places and they meet together
only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the coronation, or the opening of
Parliament by the Queen in person, when the Commons are summoned by the Queen
to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however, Parliament is a
corporate body and cannot legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except
in the case of measures passed under the Parliament Acts, 19 n and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the United
Kingdom: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It can legislate for the
United Kingdom as a whole, or for any of these constituent countries separately,
or for any combination of them. It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man. It is not, however, the only legislature, for the Northern Ireland Parliament
has power to legislate in certain spheres, and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the Isle of
Man (the Tynwald) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless, the Parliament at
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member of the
Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure
before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
GOVERNMENT
31
Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical limits there is nothing
that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the life of a United Kingdom Parliament
was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general election held
before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor
(for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each
assembly has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate exactly
as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy by statute
the most firmly established convention of the constitution; it can legalise past illegalities
and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has power to prolong its
own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years without consulting
the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not exercise its supremacy in this way. In the first place, pressure of business
in recent decades has resulted in a large and increasing amount of delegation of legis¬
lative authority to ministers and of specific powers to local authorities and to public
corporations of various kinds; powers delegated in this way could, of course, be
withdrawn by Parliament, but existing demands on parliamentary time make such
a development extremely unlikely. Secondly, the system of party government in the
United Kingdom effectively discourages Parliament from acting in too arbitrary a
fashion; any parliamentary majority which abused its powers would almost certainly
lose electoral support.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with a pro¬
clamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a proclama¬
tion, on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and, on the other, orders
the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and place of
its meeting.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parliament.
Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, since Parliament meets
on the personal summons of the monarch. However, the passing of the Representation
of the People Act, 1867, made the duration of Parliament independent of the demise
of the Crown; both Houses stand adjourned on such an occasion only until their
members have taken the oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign immediately after the
Accession Council has made the order for proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
Seal (see p. 29), which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session.
The date so appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclama¬
tion. The effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business until Parliament
is summoned again, when any measures not yet passed must be reintroduced, unless
it has been decided that they are to be abandoned.
During the session, either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A reassembly
of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by virtue of powers specially
conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average length of a session is about 160 sitting days, divided by custom into
the following periods: one from November until Christmas lasting about 30 sitting
days, one from January to Easter of about 50 sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun
32
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40
sitting days. Nowadays, the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of
about 10 sitting days in October, after the long summer recess.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of just over 900 peers, as follows: (1) princes of the
royal blood (who nowadays take no active part in proceedings), (2) 26 spiritual lords
(the two archbishops and 24 senior bishops of the Church of England), (3) all hereditary
peers (other than minors and those who have not proved their right to a writ of sum¬
mons) of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom,1 (4) 16 hereditary peers
of Scotland elected from their own number for each Parliament in accordance with the
provisions of the Treaty of Union, 1707, (5) one hereditary peer of Ireland elected for
life,2 (6) nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, appointed under the provisions of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, to assist the House in the performance of its judicial
functions (see pp. 86 and 89) and holding their seats in the House for life, and (7)
a number of other life peers (including life peeresses)3 created under the provisions
of the Life Peerages Act, 1958.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred as a mark of distinction
by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages, with the
exception of the Scottish and Irish peerages, carry with them, for men over 21 years
of age, a right to a seat in the House of Lords, but, according to standing orders
promulgated by that House in 1958, holders are asked, at the beginning of each
Parliament, whether they will attend the sittings of the House as often as they reason¬
ably can or whether they desire to be relieved of the obligation to attend. If they do so
desire, they are requested to apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of the
Parliament or for a shorter period, during which they are not expected to attend the
House.
Peers in constant attendance at the House of Lords are generally persons of con¬
siderable experience, many of whom are elder statesmen and others who have spent
their lives in public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but
they are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to the Palace of Westminster
(provided they attend at least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the
exception of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member
in receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment for
expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for judicial
sittings) within a maximum of three guineas a day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits on the wool¬
sack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by commission under the Great
Seal, appoints several peers to take their place on the woolsack in order of precedence
as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first of the deputy
speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed each session and takes
the chair in all committees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent
officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is charged with keeping the records
of proceedings and judgments and who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent

and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a popular assembly elected by an almost universal
adult suffrage and containing members (both men and women) from all sections of the
community. There are at present 630 members of the House of Commons (511 for
England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary for their parliamentary work
and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They are elected either at a general
election, which takes place after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, which is held when a vacancy occurs
in the House as a result of the death or resignation of a member, or as a result of the
elevation of a member of the House of Commons to the House of Lords.
The chief parliamentary officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is
elected by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of Ways and
Means, and the Deputy-Chairman, both of whom may act as Deputy Speaker; these
officers are elected by the House. In addition, there are the party officials, i.e. the
Government and Opposition Whips. Non-parliamentary or permanent officers of the
House, i.e. those who are not members of Parliament, include the Clerk of the House
of Commons, who is charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills
and signing orders; the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House;
and the Chaplain to the Speaker.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes, the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to Parliament. Permanent Boundary Commissions for
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (established in 1944) keep con¬
stituencies constantly under review and submit periodic reports, either recommending
some alteration in boundaries if, for instance, movement of the population has made
this necessary, or recommending no change. Changes in the boundaries of con¬
stituencies which came into effect for the 1955 general election increased the number
of seats in the House of Commons from 625 to the present figure of 630.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the Represen¬
tation of the People Act, 1949, which repeals and re-enacts in a single statute previous
legislation relating to the franchise, the conduct of elections and corrupt and illegal
electoral practices. Under the provisions of this Act, election to the House of Commons
is decided by secret ballot in which British subjects (except members of the House of
Lords) and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (although voting is not
compulsory), provided that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any
legal incapacity to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those whose
names are on the electoral register,1 and who are resident in that constituency on the
qualifying date. Electors normally vote in person at polling stations especially estab¬
lished for the purpose, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of the
United Kingdom employed overseas, and the wives of such persons if resident overseas
with their husbands may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy,

may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for such reasons as illness or
the nature of his work. Any person, male or female, who is a British subject of 21
years of age or over and is not otherwise disqualified, may be elected to the House of
Commons. Categories of persons disqualified for election include peers, clergy of the
Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland, or the Roman
Catholic Church, undischarged bankrupts, and those expressly precluded from stand¬
ing as candidates under the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, such as
holders of judicial offices, civil servants, members of the regular armed forces and the
police forces, members of the legislature of any country or territory outside the
Commonwealth, and holders of other public offices listed in the Act.
Parliamentary Privilege
Both Houses of Parliament enjoy certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect them from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out their duties. These
privileges apply collectively to both Houses and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil proceedings for a period
from forty days before to forty days after a session of Parliament; freedom of speech in
debate; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right to pro¬
nounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest for peers as
for members of the House of Commons; freedom of speech in debate; freedom of
access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to commit for con¬
tempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House
of Commons; they exist independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth century,
and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general election
or a by-election, the parties put up candidates for election; any other citizen who wishes
may also stand.1 The electorate then indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll
on election day, which of the opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority of supporters
in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of the
majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on the formal
advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members in the House
of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments on the advice
of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while
the members of any other parties or any Independents who have been elected may

and Conservative candidates; Liberal candidates numbered 216. The number of Independents

support the Government or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own
view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in October, 1959, 78-7 per cent of the electorate voted,
compared with 84 per cent in 1950, 82-6 per cent in 1951 and 76-8 per cent in 1955.

* A majority of 100 over all other parties. This is the first time since the establishment of the
modern party system in Britain in the nineteenth century that a party has increased its parliamen¬
tary strength in four successive general elections and the first time that a party has retained office
after being in power for the duration of two full Parliaments.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable extent
upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement:
that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must govern and therefore accepts
its decisions; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticise and therefore
sets time aside for that criticism to be heard. As far as is compatible with effective
government, the Prime Minister meets the convenience of the Leader of the Opposition
and the Leader of the Opposition meets the convenience of the Prime Minister.
Through the respective Whips there is a measure of agreement on the subjects to be
36
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
debated and on the time to be allowed; sometimes even on the information to be pro¬
vided and the proposed line of attack. In this way, Parliament has a chance of hearing
a full discussion on policy from every point of view.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organisations;
inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips, who in addition to their other functions
are expected to maintain the voting strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance
of members at important debates. In the House of Commons, this work is done for
the Government by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (the Chief Whip),
the Junior Lords of the Treasury, and the political officers of Her Majesty’s Household
—the Treasurer, the Comptroller and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Opposition Whips
have no official position, but their parliamentary duties are the same. There are also
Government and Opposition Whips in the House of Lords.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are (i) to make laws regulating the life of the
community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make available finance
for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary for the services
of the State, and (3) to criticise and control the Government. By custom, Parliament
is also consulted before the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements
(in spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the
advice of the Government, and strictly speaking, is not subject to parliamentary
approval at all).
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on forms and rules, many of which date back to
the beginning of the sixteenth century and even earlier.
Each House has its own standing orders, and although the system of debate is
much the same in the two Houses, in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
far greater measure of control. In the House of Lords, the office of Speaker could
be held by a commoner, since the woolsack on which the Lord Chancellor sits as
Speaker is technically outside the precincts of the House,1 but in fact, the holder of the
office is always created a peer. The office carries with it no inherent authority to check
or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general sense of the House and
not by rulings of its Speaker.
In the Commons, the Speaker has the prime duty of controlling debate. It is his
responsibility to see that parliamentary time is used to the best possible advantage
and, therefore, although he must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any
infringement of minority rights, he has power to limit unreasonable obstruction and
his rulings on points of order cannot be challenged at the time. It is the duty of the
Speaker to allow or disallow a closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end discussion
so that the matter may be put to the vote) and generally to enforce the rules of debate
of the House. In cases of grave and continuous disorder, he may even adjourn the
House or suspend the sitting.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the Speaker,
and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of votes is cast, the
Speaker must give the decisive vote; he does this (if possible) in such a way as to avoid
change and leave the question to be debated on another occasion. The procedure on
1 When the Lord Chancellor takes part in the debates of the House of Lords (as he frequently
does), he moves away from the woolsack.
GOVERNMENT
37
voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the House of Commons, but the
Speaker or chairman has no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating
to Bills and delegated legislation, the House is governed by the principle that unless
there is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the House
is sitting judicially (see pp. 86 and 89) the question is put in such a way that, if the
votes were equal, there would be no interference with the order under appeal.
The Speaker of the House of Commons has the responsibility of deciding whether
a Bill is a Money Bill (i.e. a Bill dealing only with national taxation and finance, with
regard to which the powers of the House of Lords have been curtailed by the Parliament
Act, 1911); and who, in case of doubt, is the Leader of the Opposition. He is also
responsible for such matters as the decision whether a prima facie case has been made
against persons accused of breach of privilege; the issue of warrants for elections to
fill vacancies in the House; and the appointment of the chairmen of the standing
committees.
As a rule, all proceedings of either House are public (for the right to debate in
secret is exercised only rarely), and a verbatim record is published daily in the official
reports, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard).
Parlia?nentary Committees
A committee of the whole House is the House itself, presided over by a chairman
instead of the Speaker, appointed to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, and also
(in the House of Commons) the resolutions authorising the expenditure of public
money. The Committees of Supply and of Ways and Means are committees of the
whole House of Commons, whose chief function is to discharge the financial duties
of the House concerning the grant of public money and the levying of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which exist
to a varying degree to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and
complex work. They are:
(1) standing committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons as
necessary, for the consideration of Bills and other business committed to
them. With the exception of the Scottish Standing and Grand Committees1
(which deal with Public Bills and other matters relating to Scotland), and the
Welsh Grand Committee2 (which considers the annual report for Wales and
selects specified subjects for debate), each standing committee consists of
from thirty to fifty members nominated by the Committee of Selection (a
body of eleven members drawn from the main parties in the House at the
beginning of each session) ; in all cases the parties are represented in proportion
to their numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing committee is
generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House; and
(2) select committees, including joint select committees of both Houses, which
are appointed to inquire into and report to the House on special matters.
Some of these, such as the Select Committees on Public Accounts, on Estimates,
on Statutory Instruments, and on the nationalised industries, tend to be
re-appointed each session. Others are set up as and when required.
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of thirty members nominated from Scottish con¬
stituencies with up to twenty other nominated members, and the Scottish Grand Committee
contains all the members for the Scottish constituencies, and not more than fifteen others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 25 other nominated members selected in order to make the balance
of parties in the committee approximate to that in the whole House.
38
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Various other committees exist to deal with Private Bill legislation. There are
also a number of unofficial committees, consisting either of one party or of members
of all parties, such as study groups concerning themselves with particular issues,
e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee; and parliamentary party committees,
e.g., the Labour Policy Committee, and the Conservative and Unionist Members
Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee.
Legislation
Legislation can be initiated from either side of the House; but no Bill involving
taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far unless the Government
agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it. This has the effect of giving the
Government exclusive rights over a wide field of legislation, and as a result most
Public Bills are presented by the Government. However, members can introduce
Public Bills on their own initiative, and such Bills can be debated on certain days
expressly set aside for the purpose in each session. Peers can introduce Public Bills
in the House of Lords at any time during a session without notice. In addition, persons
and bodies outside Parliament can introduce Private Bills relating solely to matters of
individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may be introduced in either House, unless they deal with finance or repre¬
sentation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however,
Bills likely to raise political controversy are introduced in the Commons, while legis¬
lation of an intricate but non-financial nature is frequently introduced and fully
discussed in the Lords before being sent to the Commons, where it can then be dealt
with more speedily.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of Lords as
in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduction;
it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one and several
weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it may be given a Second Reading as the
result of a debate on its general merits or principles. It is then referred for detailed
examination (in the Commons) either to a standing committee or, if the House so
decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; and, in the Lords, to a committee
of the whole House. When the committee stage is finished, the Bill is reported to the
House, and a further stage takes place during which the committee’s amendments
may be altered, additional amendments may be suggested and incorporated, and,
if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted to committee. Finally, it is submitted for a
Third Reading and, if passed, it is sent on from the Commons to the Lords or from
the Lords to the Commons (depending on its place of origin), where it enters on
the same course again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the
Bill must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise reached, before the Bill
becomes law.
An exception to this procedure is made in the case of some financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing taxation,
and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the Supply Services
from the Consolidated Fund. As a general rule, these Bills are introduced in the House
of Commons upon resolutions in a committee of the whole House and they may be
initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, which is now usually given by commission. The
Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since the early eighteenth
century.
GOVERNMENT
39
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; and they are then returned
to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However, should any Lords
Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the Statute Book, for no
debating time would be allotted to it—at any rate until a new government came into
power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be
able to prevent a Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In
the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return
it unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for the
consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amend¬
ments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments;
nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money Bills;
and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949, any other Bill which has been passed
by the House of Commons in two successive sessions may be presented for Royal
Assent without the consent of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the
date of the Second Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is
finally passed in that House. These limitations to the powers of the Lords are based
on the belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected assembly,
lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legislative process, not in
thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings in the House of Lords give
time for further reflection, and often elicit new points of view.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by Act of Parliament but by Orders
in Council, Orders, Warrants, Regulations and Rules, has been part of the parliamen¬
tary system for at least six hundred years. Parliament, however, made but sparing
use of its power to delegate legislation (except during a period of social, political and
economic change in the second half of the fifteenth and most of the sixteenth centuries)
until the end of the nineteenth century, when a changing conception of the part
that should be played by the State in the life of the community made inroads upon
parliamentary time and thus caused the system to be adopted on a more extensive
scale. With the ever-increasing scope of Government activity during the past sixty
years, pressure on parliamentary time has become even more acute; as a result, the
system of delegated legislation has become generally accepted, and there are at present
few Acts of Parliament which do not contain provisions for its use.
The system of delegated legislation empowers ministers and other authorities to
regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. Its advantages are said1
to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus enabling Parliament
to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller attention to matters of
policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that it encourages flexibility,
in that administrative details can be worked out as and when the necessity arises
‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation to local and other
special circumstances than they possibly can be during the passage of a Bill through
Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for it is ‘the means by which the
legislature can dispense with its own deliberative procedure and arm the executive
with power to take immediate action’; and (4) that it provides a speedy, convenient
and accurate means of giving effect to the policy of Parliament.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In order to minimise the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities directly responsible to
Parliament, i.e. to Ministers of the Crown, to Government departments for which
ministers are responsible, or to organisations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Act which delegates legislative power generally defines the precise
limits of this power and, in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to
confirm or annul the statutory instruments1 by which delegated legislation is enacted.
Certain Acts also require direct consultation with organisations which will be affected
by delegated legislation before such legislation is made.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation by the
Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is set up each session to report on
the unusual or unexpected use of statutory powers.
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of ‘no
confidence’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government considers
so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’, and thus to force the
Government to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with the
authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorised by Parliament is described
in Chapter XII, Finance. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which ministers, in rotation, answer questions put to them on
matters for which they are responsible, thus focusing the attention of the public
on the day-to-day processes of government;
(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee of
Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion, initiated by the Opposition,
for the examination of some aspect of the Government’s administrative
policy which has been included in the Estimates;
(3) the practice of bringing on a debate later in the same day by moving the
adjournment of the House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed
by the Speaker to be definite, urgent, of public importance, and to be the
responsibility of the Government, and if 40 members rise in their places to
support it, or 10 members rise and the House grants leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion for the adjournment
of the House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power of Parliament to confirm or annul some statutory instruments.
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
1 Statutory instruments are made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instruments of
delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 vrere known as ‘statutory rules and orders’
(‘S.R. & O.’).

Public Interest in Parliament
The public’s interest in the work of Parliament is shown by the queues which form
outside the Houses of Parliament for admission to the public galleries, by the growth
in the circulation of the daily official report {Hansard) which has increased to nearly
five times the pre-war figure, and by the large audiences which listen to the regular
broadcast programmes about parliamentary proceedings.
The major news agencies and national newspapers have special parliamentary
correspondents to report on parliamentary activities. A television broadcast of the
State opening of Parliament was transmitted for the first time in 1958. The Hansard
Society for Parliamentary Government, an unofficial non-party educational society
which was founded in 1944, continues to promote interest in parliamentary affairs.
The Northern Ireland Parliament
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and a House
of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by a Governor,
who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her Majesty’s name; the
Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor
of Londonderry) together with 24 senators elected by the House of Commons accord¬
ing to the principle of proportional representation; and the House of Commons con¬
sists of 52 members, elected by a system of parliamentary franchise similar to that
which operates in Great Britain. The House, unless sooner dissolved, continues in
existence for a period of five years.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace, order and
good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters except those especially
reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, i.e. the Crown or succession to
the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the postal services; the Supreme Court;
customs and excise; income and profits taxes; coinage; standards of weights and
measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and
lighthouses, buoys and beacons. The Northern Ireland Parliament is also prohibited
from making laws which would interfere with religious freedom, and from taking
property without compensation.
In consequence of these reservations, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act, 1920, for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland con¬
stituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; in accordance with this
provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was the
chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet government
developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance; many of its powers were
transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
Government departments. The present-day Privy Council exists mainly to give
effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some branch of
public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. In i960, there were just under
300 Privy Counsellors.
42 BRITAIN : AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is usually presided
over by the Sovereign. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule, not
fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the submission for the Sovereign’s approval
of Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing fundamentally in con¬
stitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal prerogative, for example,
those embodying royal instructions to colonial Governors; and those which are
authorised by Act of Parliament and are a form of delegated legislation. Members of
the Privy Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not
thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;
this rests with the ministers in whose departments the draft orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council must be
published in the London Gazette, which is an official periodical published by the
authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations, some
of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as summoning or
dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from those
of the full Privy Council in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally be present. These
committees, which have advisory functions, may be prerogative, such as the committee
which deals with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man, and the committees for medical research, scientific and
industrial research, agricultural research, overseas research, and nature conservation;
or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with applications for
the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the Privy
Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the Council; as Minister
for Science he exercises particular supervision over all matters relating to scientific
research.
Judicial Committee
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal on a number
of legal issues arising in certain member nations of the Commonwealth and in the
United Kingdom dependent territories. Its appellate jurisdiction derives from the
principle of English common law which recognises ‘the right of all the King’s subjects
to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in Council’ if they believe that the courts of
law have failed to do them justice.
Appeals come to it in limited categories of cases where a right of appeal has been
specially created, e.g., by Statute, Order in Council or Letters Patent, or by special
leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee. Appeals
are heard by a board of three or five drawn from the committee, depending on the
significance of the case, the quorum being three. Invitations to sit on the board are
issued by the Lord Chancellor, who thus determines which members of the committee
shall hear particular appeals. The boards are generally selected from the Lord
GOVERNMENT
43
Chancellor, ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although Lords
Justices of Appeal and other members of the Privy Council who have held high
judicial office are also asked to sit when business is heavy. Chief Justices and certain
judges from other Commonwealth countries have usually been sworn of the Privy
Council and may be invited to sit on the boards.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.
Composition
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time, both
in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The usual ministerial
offices may be classified under the following heads:
1. The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government but has
no department.
2. Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present seven Secretaries of State—for the Home Department,
Foreign Affairs, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, Colonies, War, and Air.
The more recently created posts usually have the formal title of Minister ,
and there are, for example, Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food;
Aviation; Defence; Education; Health; Housing and Local Government (also
for Welsh Affairs); Labour; Pensions and National Insurance; Power; Trans¬
port; and Works. A few of the older posts have special titles: the Chancellor
of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and for a number of
other financial and central departments); the President of the Board of Trade;
the First Lord of the Admiralty; and the Postmaster General.
3. Non-Departmental Ministers, or ministers who are the holders of various
traditional offices, including the Lord President of the Council, the Lord
Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,1 the Paymaster-General
and, at present, a Minister without Portfolio. Usually these ministers have
few or no departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special
functions which the Prime Minister may wish to entrust to them. Sometimes,
however, traditional offices are combined with major departmental duties, for
example, in the present Government, the Lord President of the Council is
entrusted with the general duty of promoting scientific and technological
development as Minister for Science (a post created in October 1959) and the
Lord Privy Seal has departmental duties in the Foreign Office where he is
specially concerned with European Affairs.
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers. The Lord Chancellor has depart¬
mental functions; he is also in a somewhat special position as a Minister o
the Crown who is also head of the judiciary in England and Wales. The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the Attorney Genera
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed by the
reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor. In the present Government, the Chancellor of the Duchy is
responsible for the co-ordination of the Government Information Services.
44
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland.
5. Ministers of State, who are deputy ministers in Government departments
where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or when it involves frequent
travelling overseas. There is now a Minister of State in the Foreign Office,
one in the Commonwealth Relations Office, one in the Colonial Office, and
one at the Board of Trade. In addition, the Secretary of State for Scotland is
assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State, and there is a Minister of
State for Welsh Affairs.
6. Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government Whips.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all ministers are appointed
by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
Government s continuance in office depends upon the maintenance of a majority
in that House. There must, however, always be some ministers in the House of Lords,
partly because the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, limits the number
of ministers who may sit and vote in the Commons while receiving salaries from the
Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of spokesmen of stand¬
ing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the House of Lords.
The Prime Minister
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during the
eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the holder of this
office derives from his status as leader of the majority party in Parliament and from
his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their
resignation or dismissal individually. In modern times, the Prime Minister always
holds the office of First Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, and may also hold
another portfolio.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general business
of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a general supervision
over departments, settling departmental differences and approving important depart¬
mental decisions where reference to the Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister
speaks for the Government in the House of Commons on the most important topics
and answers questions on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister s responsibilities include making recommendations for the
appointment of Church of England archbishops, bishops and other senior clergy and
incumbents of Crown livings, as well as for appointments to high judicial and civil
offices such as those of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Justices of Appeal, Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, Lord Lieutenants of counties,1 some Regius Professors in certain

Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.

universities, and trustees of certain national museums. He also makes recommendations
for the award of many civil honours and distinctions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers who are selected by the Prime
Minister personally. Membership is not fixed, although the holders of certain important
ministerial offices are always included; the number of members is now usually not
more than twenty.
The origins of the Cabinet can be traced back to informal conferences held between
the Sovereign and his or her leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council,
during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role
in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of organised political parties
stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are1: the final determination of the policy to be sub¬
mitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with
the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co-ordination and delimitation
of the authority of the several departments of State. The Cabinet has no legal authority,
however, since its decisions are valid by convention and not by law.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its mem¬
bers are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose any information.
The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of other State
papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving disclosure
of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign through the
Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet decision is
advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before the decision is made public.
From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of unprejudiced
debate, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for every statement
made and every point conceded.
In normal times, the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not sitting.
Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time, if a matter
urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings, decisions are
reached on major issues of Government policy, and the Cabinet settles any matters
which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
In determining Government policy, whether in the form of proposed legislation
for the consideration of Parliament or otherwise, the Cabinet is able to take into
account the widest possible range of interests in the country as a whole, by means
of an elaborate machinery of consultation, both formal and informal. For the investi¬
gation of matters considered to be of the greatest importance, and where 13 not
of the essence, the procedure frequently adopted is the appointment (by Royal W arrant)
of a Royal Commission, whose members are selected on grounds of their wide experience
and diverse knowledge of the subject matter under consideration. A Royal Commission
examines written and oral evidence from many interested organisations and individuals
and, on this evidence, submits a report containing recommendations which the
1As defined in the Report of the Machinery of Government Committee (the Haldane
Committee), 1918, Cd. 9230.
46
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government may accept in whole or in part, or upon which it may decide to take no
further action or to delay action until a later date.
The Cabinet carries on much of its work by means of a committee system which
originated in the nineteenth century and has been developed to keep pace with
Government business during the past sixty years. The system involves the reference
of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee com¬
posed of the ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail and
either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations for
action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend Cabinet meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be members
of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclusions
are recorded, even these records have a strictly limited circulation. Responsibility
for the keeping of records lies with the Secretariat of the Cabinet, known as the
Cabinet Office.
Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle of
the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to act not as individuals
but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group. It does not require
every Cabinet minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of
individual ministers may be passive rather than active when the decision to be taken
does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time,
every minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not repudiate,
either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have received Cabinet
approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been agreed with the other depart¬
ments concerned (including the Treasury). A minister must also be prepared to vote
with the Government on all issues, and where necessary to speak in support or defence
of its policy; if he feels himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the
majority of his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign. A minister who
does not resign in these circumstances cannot later reject criticism on the ground that
he did not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold identical
views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department means
that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its acts and omissions
and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any injustice to an
individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticised in Parliament, whether
he is personally responsible or not. Since the majority of ministers are members of the
House of Commons, they are available to answer questions and to defend themselves
against criticism in person. Ministers who are in the House of Lords must be repre¬
sented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf, usually their
Parliamentary or Under-Secretaries; in the present Government, the Foreign Secretary
is represented in the Commons by a Cabinet Minister, the Lord Privy Seal.
GOVERNMENT
47
Ministers are expected to take the final decision on all matters relating to their
spheres of administration, unless these are of such political importance that Cabinet
sanction is required. If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire of
criticism in Parliament he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the
matter as one of confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be
liable to lose office.
Ministerial responsibility is an effective way of bringing government under public
control, for the knowledge that any departmental action may be reported to and
examined in Parliament discourages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are organs of Government used to give effect to Govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may and
frequently do work with and through local authorities, statutory boards, and Govern¬
ment-sponsored organisations which, while not forming part of Government
departments, are under varying degrees of Government control.
As a rule, a change of Government does not immediately affect the number or
general functions of Government departments, although a radical change in policy
may be accompanied by some organisational change. The widening scope of Govern¬
ment activity in the past half-century has, however, led gradually to the formation of
many new deoartments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, e.g., the Post Office and the Board of Customs
and Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments cover Great
Britain (England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland) e.g., the
Ministry of Labour; others cover England and Wales only, e.g., the Ministry of Health,
and there are similar but separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Some departments, e.g., the Ministry of Education, make special arrangements
for Welsh affairs.
Departments differ in size and in the number, type and complexity of their functions,
and some have regional and local offices. Most departments have a minister of their
own in control; a very few have no minister responsible to Parliament, e.g., the
Exchequer and Audit Department under the Comptroller and Auditor General, who
is an officer of Parliament and not of the Government; and some are in the charge of
ministers who have other duties. For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for
the administration of a number of departments, including H.M. Stationery Office,
the Central Office of Information, the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department
of the Government Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works
Loan Board, the National Savings Committee and certain museums and art galleries.
This section provides an outline of the principal functions of the main Government
departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not grouped
according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in alphabetical order,
except for the Cabinet Office and the Treasury (which, in view of their central position,
are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland departments (which are grouped
at the end of the section). Further information on the work undertaken by the various
departments is given in later sections of this handbook under the relevant subject
headings.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, or Secretariat of the Cabinet, was introduced as an emergency
institution during the first world war and has grown into an organ of great importance
48
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. The secretariat is responsible for the
keeping of Cabinet records, for providing information and advice to ministers, and for
issuing directives or promulgating the decisions of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister
to the departments concerned. It has a military side and a civil side. Attached to the
Cabinet Office is the Central Statistical Office, which is charged with the collection,
analysis and presentation of statistics relating to the national economy.
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First Lord
of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never meet as a board
and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the Exchequer assisted by
two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the Economic Secretary. There is
also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip
in the House of Commons.
The functions of the Treasury fall under four main headings: finance (sub-divided
into home finance and overseas finance), control of expenditure, general civil service
establishment matters, and co-ordination of economic policy. Home finance includes
taxation policy (though executive responsibility for the collection of revenue lies with
the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise), the provision of funds for the
day-to-day needs of the public services, currency and banking, and the management
of the national debt. The Treasury has been heavily occupied with overseas financial
questions since the end of the second world war because of the post-war emphasis on
the problem of the balance of payments.
Control of expenditure is a matter partly for Government departments and partly
for the Treasury, which scrutinises the detailed annual Estimates and exercises a general
supervision over departmental expenditure, subject always to the overriding control
and authority of Parliament. The Treasury’s responsibility in general civil service
questions has developed gradually out of the control of expenditure.
The co-ordination of economic policy is a function which the Treasury has acquired
since the end of the second world war. It arose from the acceptance by successive
Governments of responsibility for maintaining full employment, safeguarding the
balance of payments and avoiding inflation.
Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel
is responsible for the drafting of all Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions
of Bills extending exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s
Department. The office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills through Parliament;
it advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and it attends sittings
of both Houses of Parliament, and their committees. In addition, the Office of the
Parliamentary Counsel drafts subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and
advises the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling
within its special experience.
The Admiralty
The Admiralty Act of 1690 appointed Lords Commissioners to the Board of
Admiralty to execute the office of Lord High Admiral. The responsibilities of the
Board of Admiralty are, briefly, to build, direct, maintain and administer the Royal
Navy within the framework of the Government’s naval defence policy. The present
Board of Admiralty comprises nine members (two ministerial, six naval and one civil
GOVERNMENT
49
servant); the First Lord is the ministerial head of the department and the other
members are responsible to him for specific duties. The Board of Admiralty is served
by three departmental groups: (i) the divisions of the naval staff, responsible for advis¬
ing on general and technical policy, strategy, tactics, operational planning, the disposi¬
tion of the Fleet, methods of naval warfare, and material requirements; (2) the
departments responsible for advising on personnel and material policy, for providing
the men (and their training), for research and development projects, for providing the
ships (including their weapons and equipment) and supplies, for the general organisa¬
tion and administration of associated naval establishments at home and abroad, and
for stating (to the Ministry of Aviation) naval aircraft requirements; and (3) the
secretariat branches, which co-ordinate business, provide advice on precedent and
on general Government policy, ensure financial regularity and receive, pay and account
for all money administered by the department.
The Admiralty also administers the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the National
Institute of Oceanography.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England and Wales
for administering Government policy for agriculture, horticulture and fishing. In the
operational control of certain diseases of animals its responsibilities extend also to
Scotland.
In England and Wales the ministry deals with questions relating to the supply
and manufacture of food including its composition, labelling and advertising; its
preservation and nutritional qualities; slaughterhouses; the quality and cleanliness of
milk; the prevention of damage by pests; and the supply of welfare foods for mothers
and young children. Ministerial responsibility for the maintenance of reserve stocks
of food extends throughout Great Britain.
The ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign countries
interested in the United Kingdom as a market for their food exports, and is responsible
for schemes such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. It contributes to the work
of international bodies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United
Nations.
The ministry is also responsible for the administration of the Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew.
Ordnance Survey Department. The Ordnance Survey is administered by the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, although it is itself responsible for its day-to-day
affairs. The department is responsible for the survey of Great Britain and the mainten¬
ance and publication of maps thereof; for drawing, printing and publishing maps and
plans from the survey on scales ranging from 1/1250 to 1/1,250,000. It also undertakes
a considerable amount of agency work in compilation, drawing and printing for other
departments, particularly for the War Office, Geological Survey and Land Registry.
The Air Ministry
The Air Ministry consists of the Air Council, and the four executive departments
by which the council is served.
The Air Council, which has administrative control of the Royal Air Force (RAF),
comprises eight members (two ministerial, five air force and one civil servant). Its
president is the Secretary of State for Air and the other members are responsible to
him for specific duties. The departments which serve the Air Council are: (1) the
department of the Chief of Air Staff, responsible for policy, planning and the fighting
5°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
efficiency of the RAF; advice on the conduct of operations and the issue of operational
orders; operational requirements, flying training, ground combat, navigational,
command and staff training; defence, including the use of guided weapons; operational
and defence research; flight safety; (2) the department of the Air Member for Personnel,
responsible for all matters connected with the personnel of the RAF (except training
and establishments); (3) the department of the Air Member for Supply and Organisa¬
tion, responsible for internal organisation in the RAF in peace and war; establishment
of personnel, aircraft, marine craft and mechanical transport; transportation; works
and technical services; technical training; engineering; supply services; work study;
and (4) the department of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Air, responsible
for general control and co-ordination of Air Ministry procedure and the conduct of
official business; control of expenditure; establishment of Air Ministry headquarters
and outstations and all civilian staff matters; parliamentary and legal business; and the
general administration of the Meteorological Office.
The supply of airframes, aero engines, and certain other weapons and equipment
is arranged through the Ministry of Aviation.
The Meteorological Office, for which the Secretary of State for Air is responsible,
provides the national weather service and meteorological library. It supplies the material
for sound and television forecasts and much of the weather data published by the press.
Local weather information centres have been opened in London, Glasgow and
Manchester, from which inquirers may get facts and forecasts, usually free of charge,
covering most of the northern hemisphere. The office is also responsible for meteoro¬
logical, climatological, and geophysical research.
The Ministry of Aviation
The Ministry of Aviation was created by Order in Council in 1959 to combine in
one ministry the functions relating to civil aviation and aircraft production which were
previously divided between the former ministries of Transport and Civil Aviation
and of Supply. The department has also assumed certain of the former Ministry of
Supply’s defence and industrial responsibilities.
The ministry’s civil aviation responsibilities include the regulation of flying, the
promotion of air safety and efficiency, the provision, administration and equipment of
State-controlled civil aerodromes and other ground services, the organisation of research
on, and development of, civil aircraft, the negotiation of international air transport
agreements, the registration of aircraft, the licensing of aircrew and aircraft maintenance
personnel, and research on air navigation. The minister appoints the members of the
airline corporations and may give them directions in matters affecting the national
interest; he also approves associate agreements between the corporations and the
independent air transport companies for the operation of scheduled services.
The ministry’s defence responsibilities include the supply of military aircraft,
guided and ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, radar and other electronic equipment
for the fighting services; it is also responsible for their design and development,
and carries out the necessary research.
The ministry is also the department primarily responsible for carrying out Govern¬
ment policy in regard to the aircraft industry, the light metals fabricating industry and the
electronics industry (excluding telephones and telegraph equipment and electric lamps).
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office deals with the affairs of the great majority of the non-self-
governing countries of the Commonwealth. At the head of the Colonial Office is
GOVERNMENT
51
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is the minister responsible to Parliament
for the general administration of those territories. The main functions of the Colonial
Office are to convey to the governments of the dependent territories the views and
wishes of the United Kingdom Government on broad matters of policy and to provide
them with guidance on a wide range of matters through a staff of professional advisers
and with the help of advisory committees composed of men and women eminent in
many fields. The department is also responsible for ensuring that the interests of govern¬
ments and peoples of the dependent territories are safeguarded and promoted, and
for undertaking expert service of many kinds, including the allocation of funds for
development purposes under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts and the
provision of administrative and professional staff for the public services of the depen¬
dent territories. Other functions of the Colonial Office include the care of students
from the dependent territories in the United Kingdom, the British Council acting as
agent in providing for their general welfare.
The Colonial Office does not directly administer the territories with which it deals.
Each of these has its own administration and an increasing measure of autonomy.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office links the United Kingdom Government with
the Governments of the other member nations of the Commonwealth (Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana,
the Federations of Malaya and Nigeria, and Cyrprus), with the Federation of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland, and with the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia.
The duties of the office are: to advise the Secretary of State on policy affecting the
other members of the Commonwealth; to co-ordinate the work of the various United
Kingdom departments in so far as other Commonwealth countries are concerned; to
arrange consultation with other members of the Commonwealth on all matters of
common concern; and to act as the main channel of communication through which
information is exchanged.
The Secretary of State maintains relations with the Irish Republic (which, although
no longer a member of the Commonwealth, is not treated as a foreign country),
and he is responsible for the administration of the High Commission Territories
(Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland).
The Board of Customs and Excise
Commissioners to collect the customs and the excise revenues were first appointed
by the Long Parliament in 1643 (although after the Restoration the older method of
collection through private contractors was revived for a time). The two branches of the
revenue remained distinct until i9°9’ when they were amalgamated under Commis¬
sioners of Customs and Excise. The primary work of the Boaid of Customs and
Excise is to collect and administer the customs and excise duties imposed from time
to time in the annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancelloi
of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. The board is also responsible
for preventing and detecting evasion of the revenue laws, including smuggling and
illicit distillation.
In addition to its revenue work, the board undertakes a wide range of non-revenue

for carrying letters, which was previously attached to the Crown. The minister at its
head is the Postmaster General, and its work is now mainly concerned with the opera¬
tion of the inland postal, telegraph and telephone services and, in co-operation with
other countries and interests, of the overseas postal and telecommunications services.

coal mines, metalliferous mines and quarries, and it conducts or arranges for research
on these matters and on other specific projects.
The Department of the Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
Government departments in England and Wales; the duties of his department include
drafting and preparing litigation and prosecutions, representing departments in court,
and giving general advice on the interpretation and application of the law. It also
undertakes a considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of real
property and with the administration of the residuary estates (undisposed of by will)
of certain deceased persons, and it deals with the outstanding property and rights
of dissolved companies.
Some Government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury Solicitor
for their legal work; others have their own legal staffs for a proportion of the work
and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often, for conveyancing;
and others, whose administrative work is based on or deals with a code of specialised
law or involves a great deal of legal work, have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also Procurator General (Queen’s Proctor) and in that
capacity has certain duties connected with the operation of the divorce laws.
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
I he Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is a department of
the Privy Council, accounts for its own Vote in the Estimates and is responsible to
Parliament through the Minister for Science.
The work of the department covers research in the United Kingdom (except defence
research) in all branches of natural science except medicine and atomic energy, and in
all industries except agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Its primary functions are to
undertake research in the national interest and to meet the requirements of other
Government departments; to encourage research and the application of scientific
knowledge in industry; and to encourage fundamental research at universities and

The Board of Trade
The Board of Trade was formally constituted as a Committee of the Privy Council
by an Order in Council of 1786, which still provides its constitutional basis. Since
1867, the President of the Board of Trade has been the only effective member of this
committee and his authority is, in practice, similar to that of a Secretary of State or

merchandise marks, companies, bankruptcy, insurance, distribution of industry,
films, and enemy property.
In addition, the Board of Trade is the department generally responsible for Govern¬
ment relations with all industries which are not specifically the concern of other
departments. In this connection, it provides both a channel of communication with
and a point of contact for these industries, and a central place at which knowledge
about them is accumulated, analysed, and used as a basis for advising ministers and
other departments. The main industries which fall outside the scope of the Board of
Trade’s specific concern are food, agriculture and fisheries, building and quarrying,
iron and steel, shipbuilding, fuel and power, and transport.
The Ministry of Transport
The Ministry of Transport (established in 1919 and known between 1953 and 1959
as the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation) has powers and duties relating to
inland transport and shipping.
As the department responsible for inland transport, the ministry is charged with
certain duties relating to railways, inland waterways, roads, bridges and ferries, and the
vehicles they carry. The Minister of Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads
in England and Wales; he appoints the members of the British Transport Commission
and agrees the general lines on which its development programme is drawn up.
The marine side of the ministry’s work is concerned with national and international
shipping policy; ships, their masters, officers and men; the provision and operation of
troopships; safety of life at sea; navigation (including pilotage, lighthouses and other
aids to safety in navigation); wreck and salvage; harbours, docks, piers and river
conservancy; and the Coastguard Service. The ministry also has responsibilities
(which include giving advice to the Government on economic policy), for the merchant
shipbuilding industry and for the repair and marine engineering industries.
The War Office
The office of Secretary of State for War was established in 1854. In 1904, the Army
Council was constituted on the model of the Board of Admiralty, with the Secretary
of State for War as president and a membership of both military and civil personnel.
The War Office is responsible for the administrative control of the Army, including
appointments, promotions, postings and payment. Its functions include the planning
of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military information; the
research, development and production of all arms and equipment for the Army (except
aircraft, guided and nuclear weapons and electronic equipment for which the Ministry
6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Aviation is responsible); the determination of financial and labour policy connected
with the Army; and the supervision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and abroad.
The War Office is also responsible for most of the Royal Ordnance factories (which
produce certain stores and equipment for all three Services and other users, such as
Government departments and some overseas countries) and for the greater part of
the disposal of surplus Service equipment.
The Ministry of Works
The main functions of the Ministry of Works are: the provision of office accommoda¬
tion for Government departments (including public buildings overseas), and of many
other types of accommodation required by civil and Service departments; the design,
purchase, supply and maintenance of furniture and equipment for Government depart¬
ments and certain other bodies, and their supplies of fuel, household articles and stores;
the administration of the Ancient Monuments Acts and the maintenance of those ancient
monuments and historic buildings which are in its charge; the making of grants, on the

of outstanding interest; the maintenance of royal palaces and certain official residences;
the provision of building, engineering and supplies services for certain State ceremonial
occasions; the management and maintenance of the royal parks and certain other
open spaces.
The ministry also has responsibilities for the general efficiency of the building,
civil engineering and building materials industries and for co-ordinating information
about current and future building programmes. For this, regular consultation with
the industries at national and regional levels and a comprehensive statistical service
are maintained. Encouragement is also given to the industries to make full use of the
results of research and development.
SCOTLAND
The first Secretary for Scotland was appointed in 1885 in recognition of the fact
that Scotland required a system of administration separate from that of England and
Wales. Forty years later, his powers and duties were transferred to a Secretary of
State, appointed by the Secretaries of State Act, 1926.
The Secretary of State is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State and three
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish Law Officers.
The Secretary of State’s functions are discharged by four main administrative depart¬
ments of equal status, each under a Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State
for the discharge of the duties of the department. The day-to-day administration of the
departments is conducted in Edinburgh, but each department has representatives in
London for liaison and parliamentary duties. The London office is generally known
as the Scottish Office, a term also used to describe all Scottish administration for which
the Secretary of State is responsible.
The four main Scottish departments are the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department, the Department of Health for
Scotland, and the Scottish Home Department. The Scottish ministers are advised and
assisted (particularly in relation to questions with which more than one of the depart¬
ments are concerned or which fall outside the province of any of them) by the Permanent
Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office, who is free from departmental duties.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
The department has a general responsibility for, and in most cases administers,

plant diseases and pests and for treating infestations in stored food; the management
of the extensive agricultural properties owned by the Secretary of State; the adminis¬
tration of grants towards the work of the eight research institutes in Scotland and the
educational and advisory services provided by the three agricultural colleges; matters
affecting animal health; the promotion of measures for safety, health and welfare of
agricultural workers; the regulation of agricultural wages; and the stimulation of
rural industries. In certain of these functions the department is assisted by eleven
agricultural executive committees, constituted of members of the agricultural industry
and organised on an area basis.
The department is responsible for the oversight and protection of the Scottish
inshore, deep sea and fresh-water fisheries. It also has functions relating to harbours,

The department also has functions relating to coast and flood protection, and is
responsible for supervising the administration of various environmental services,
including services connected with water supplies, sewerage, clean air, and clean rivers;
for welfare services, e.g., the care of the aged and handicapped persons; and for the
medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners in Scotland (including hospital services,
and the supply and repair of artificial limbs, surgical appliances and invalid chairs).
The Scottish Home Department
The Scottish Home Department has a number of important functions relating to the
maintenance of law and order; it is the department concerned with the police and
probation services, criminal justice, legal aid and the services needed by the courts;
and it is directly responsible for the administration of prisons and borstal institutions.
The department is also the central authority in Scotland for the fire service and
civil defence; for highways administration, including road safety matters (except in

The Lord Advocate is in administrative control of two departments: The Lord
Advocate's Department, which is responsible for drafting Scottish legislation, providing
legal advice on Scottish questions for other departments, and assisting the Scottish
Law Officers in certain of their legal duties; and The Crown Office, which is the central
department responsible, under the Lord Advocate, for the institution of criminal
proceedings. The Lord Advocate is also responsible for the work of the public
prosecutors—the Procurators Fiscal—who are appointed by him in each sheriff
court district.
Other Departments
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish depart¬
ments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the Secretary of
State. Such departments include the Scottish Information Office, which undertakes
information services on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Scottish
departments and, in some degree, for Great Britain departments in Scotland, and acts
as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the Department of the
Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Registry Office); the Scottish Record
Office; and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the direction
of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the
policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions
and needs.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Executive and administrative powers in connection with matters over which the
Northern Ireland Parliament has jurisdiction are vested in the Crown, and exercised
by the Governor through a number of departments. Each of the seven ministries
(Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Finance, Health and Local Government, Home
Affairs, and Labour and National Insurance) is under the control of a minister appointed
by the Governor. In addition, there are a National Assistance Board and an Exchequer
and Audit Department which, together with the Ministries of Home Affairs, Education,
and Agriculture have functions indicated by their titles. The other departments have
duties of a varied nature, which are summarised below.
The Ministry of Commerce
The Ministry of Commerce undertakes commercial intelligence work, and is con¬
cerned with industrial production and the development of, and financial help for, new
and existing industries. The department also has responsibilities in relation to electricity
and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland public transport; the Northern
GOVERNMENT

Ireland Road Fund; railways; harbours and inland waterways; fisheries; the tourist
trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries; mineral development;
scientific development; weights and measures; the registration of companies and trade
unions; and the administration of the Assurance Companies Acts and the Industrial
Assurance Acts (Northern Ireland), 1924-48.
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for matters connected with recruitment and staffing
of the Northern Ireland Civil Service; Government works services, including agency
services for certain departments of the United Kingdom Government; the preservation
of ancient monuments; valuation and ordnance survey; the Public Record Office;
the Registrar General’s Office; the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.
Other functions of the ministry include the issue of Ulster savings certificates; the
collection of death duty, stamp duty and certain transferred excise duties; work in
connection with land purchase; statute law revision; the control of charitable donations
and bequests; the control of borrowing; and the payment of university grants. The
Office of the Parliamentary Draftsmen, which prepares Bills for introduction into
Parliament, is attached to the ministry.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
The Ministry of Health and Local Government is responsible for the general super¬
vision of the Health Service in Northern Ireland, which is broadly similar to the.
National Health Service in Great Britain: the administration of the various aspects
of the service is in the hands of the Hospitals Authority, the General Health Services
Board, and the local health authorities. The ministry also exercises functions under the
Housing Acts (Northern Ireland), supervising the house-building programmes of, and
distributing grants to, local housing authorities and the Northern Ireland Housing
Trust. It also supervises various other functions of local authorities, including
planning, public health, water, sewerage and welfare services (many of which attract
specific grants-in-aid) and it controls the issue of central financial aid to local
authorities.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The ministry is responsible for the administration of the Factories Acts and other
legislation connected with industrial health and welfare; for the promotion in industry
of joint machinery for negotiation and for assistance in the prevention and settlement
of industrial disputes; for the administration of the Wages Councils Act; for the
administration of local employment offices and training centres and the machinery for
dealing with employment questions of all kinds under the Employment and Training
Act and Disabled Persons (Employment) Act; for the administration of the National
Insurance Acts and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, and of the Family
Allowances Acts; and for carrying out certain statutory functions in connection with
the National Assistance scheme in conjunction with the National Assistance Board
for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a political
or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remuneration is
found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament. The number of civil
64
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
servants under this definition amounts to nearly a million, for it includes some 358,900*
Government industrial employees in such establishments as Royal Ordnance factories
and Admiralty dockyards. The term ‘Civil Service’ is, however, generally used only to
cover non-industrial’ members of the staffs of the various Government departments
in the United Kingdom or working overseas either in the Foreign Service or for other
Government departments such as the Commonwealth Relations Office. On 1st April,
i960, the total number of non-industrial civil servants employed in all departments, at
home and overseas, was 637,374*; nearly one-third of this total are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he serves
the minister in charge of the department in which he works, by advising on the formu¬
lation of policy and by carrying out policy decisions once they have been taken.
From time to time the minister changes but the civil servant remains to serve his
successor. In Britain, changes of government do not involve changes in departmental
personnel, since it is considered that continuity makes for administrative stability.
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years. Before
then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying standards were
unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery was rife. Measures
of reform instigated during the nineteenth century included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining civil service appointments by favour or
purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission,
to organise recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State planning which
has taken place during the last fifty years, and the consequent expansion in the numbers
of civil servants and the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganisation:
recruitment competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system;
co-ordination between the various departments has been improved; and many
commissions and committees of inquiry have been appointed by the Government to
make recommendations for increased efficiency in the conduct of public business.
Moreover, civil servants, though they remain employees of their departments, have
become members of an integrated service with common conditions of employment
and common traditions and standards of conduct which belong, not to individual
departments, but to the Civil Service as a whole.
Departmental Organisation
The responsibility for the policy and activities of each department lies with the
minister, who is answerable to Parliament for what the civil servants in the department
say and do.
The internal organisation of departments is a matter for each department to decide,
and it varies according to the volume and nature of the work involved. There are,
however, features common to most departments: for example, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary (known
as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those departments where the minister
is a Secretary of State) who is also accounting officer and must appear periodically
before the Public Accounts Committee; one or more deputy secretaries; and a varying
number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries. In addition, major departments
usually have a principal finance officer and a principal establishments and organisation
officer. A number of establishment divisions have their own organisation and methods
Part-time staffs are included in these, and subsequent, figures—two part-time officers being
reckoned as equivalent to one whole-time officer.

(or ‘O & M’) branch, the members of which act in an advisory capacity as ‘efficiency
experts’. Many departments also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own
information division. The use (wholly or in part) of the standard classes and grades
of civil servants, which are described below, is common to most departments.
Control of the Service
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the Treasury
exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury
is the official head of the Plome Civil Service and the principal adviser of the Prime
Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service as a whole, and in particular on appoint¬
ments to senior posts in the service. The Treasury is responsible for the salaries and
conditions of employment of civil servants; it controls total numbers of staff and the
creation of higher posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which
serves all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods branch of
their own, and deals with general questions relating to training after entry into the
Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of departments and the distribution
of functions.
Classes and Grades
The engagement and position of all civil servants are covered by regulation, agree¬
ment and traditional practice—every civil servant being assured of a definite status
depending upon the post which he is called upon to fill. There are four main classes of
civil servants, each class containing a series of grades. The classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on policy,
for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out existing policy,
and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures and regulations.
This relatively small class, which in April 1960 numbered 2,449, is recruited
largely from university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 68,800 in April i960), which is respon¬
sible for the day-to-day conduct of Government business, including the higher
work of supply and accounts, within the framework of established policy.
Members of this class may, after entry, train for specialist work such as that
of auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 185,000
officers including clerical assistants), which undertakes all the usual clerical
work involved in running departmental business, e.g., the preparation of
accounts and the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in
accordance with known rules, and the summarising and annotation of docu¬
ments for the assistance of senior officers.
4. The Typing Class (about 26,500 members), which consists of shorthand typists,
copy typists and learner typists.
Among other classes are: the Professional, Scientific and Technical Classes, which
consist of some 70,800 civil servants with the necessary qualifications (e.g., doctors,
lawyers, engineers and research workers) for carrying out the wide range of specialised
duties which are now discharged by the Government; the Inspectorate, which numbers
about 2,600; the Ancillary Technical Class, which includes machine and duplicator
operators, prison officers, forest workers and others, and numbers some 43,500; the
Messengerial Class which, in addition to messengers, includes paper keepers, office
cleaners and similar workers (in all some 34,000); and the Minor and Manipulative
66
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Class (with some 202,500 members) which consists entirely of post office workers,
f'g’’ postmen, postal and telegraph officers, telephonists and telegraphists, and their
immediate supervisors.
The Foreign Service
Her Majesty’s Foreign Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown
which provides an interchangeable staff for service both at home and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign countries1 and, in i960, it numbered
some 2,630 established members.
The classes of the Foreign Service have their own nomenclature: Branch A corre¬
sponds roughly to the administrative class of the Home Civil Service; Branch B to the
executive and clerical classes; and Branch C to the typing class. Branch D carries
out security and guard duties at Foreign Service posts abroad, and Branch T technical
duties in the Foreign Office and at Foreign Service posts abroad. There are no equiva¬
lents of Branches D and T in the Home Civil Service. Members of Branches A, B
and C may be employed on any type of Foreign Service work—diplomatic, consular,
commercial and ‘information’. In addition, various specialists and advisers who are
seconded from the armed forces and from home Government departments (e.g.,
those concerned with financial, commercial or labour matters) are often attached to
overseas posts. At many posts abroad, some of the staff are locally engaged on a
temporary’ basis, i.e. they do not normally qualify for pensions.
Public Services of Overseas Dependent Territories
The majority of appointments in the public services of the overseas dependencies
are filled by the recruitment of local civil servants through the medium of the local
Public Service Commission or the Governor of the territory concerned. Approximately
1,000 officers are recruited each year from the United Kingdom or other Common¬
wealth countries by the Secretary of State for the Colonies for administrative, scientific
or professional appointments, and a similar number by the Crown Agents for Oversea
Governments and Administrations. Overseas officers recruited on pensionable terms
are appointed as members of Her Majesty’s Overseas Civil Service. All members
of these services are paid by the Governments of the territories in which they serve.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants in the Home Civil and Foreign
Services is in the hands of the Civil Service Commission which, in the selection of
entrants, is independent of both ministerial and parliamentary control; its members
are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of
entry is by open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examinations or interviews, or both The main
points of entry into the four main classes of the Home Civil Service are planned to
correspond to definite levels in the British educational system, and it is the commission’s
duty to study the requirements of the Civil Service in the light of the education
provided by the schools and universities.
In addition to holding examinations and conducting interviews, the commission is
responsible for issuing a certificate of qualification in respect of each successful
candidate, for placing new entrants in departments for which their qualifications are

sioners Offices associated with them) from the Board of Trade.

appr°priate, and for watching the careers of those it has selected in order to ensure
that current methods of recruitment are successful and up to date.
Temporary civil servants, who do not qualify for pensions, but are eligible for
gratuities, are normally recruited by the department concerned, either directly or
with the help of the Ministry of Labour. No qualifying examinations are required for
entrance on a temporary basis to general service.
Training after Entry
Each of the larger Government departments has a training officer and a number
of instructors, who organise both general and technical courses, ranging from courses of
systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to ‘ refresher’ courses for more
experienced staff covering technical subjects or broader subjects such as management
and supervision.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, instructional films,
and educational visits to enable civil servants to study the working of appropriate
outside bodies. In addition, officers in the early years of their service may be trans¬
ferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from department to department, in
order that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of civil service activities.
Special leave schemes enable a few senior officers, each year, to travel abroad or to
undertake research at United Kingdom universities.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the Treasury,
which runs central courses for members of the administrative, professional and
scientific classes at different stages of their careers. In addition, the division trains
departmental instructors and other special groups, for instance, superintendents of
typists, and secretaries.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with exten¬
sions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent Civil
Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments; those from class to
class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open only to serving members
of specified civil service classes), and partly by departments themselves. All promotions
to the administrative class from other classes require Treasury approval. Promotions
to most of the highest positions in the Civil Service, i.e. permanent secretary, deputy
secretary, principal establishments officer and principal finance officer, must be approved
by the Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters by the official head of the Home
Civil Service.
Conditions of Service
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council,1 which is composed jointly of
official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
service is provided through the various staff associations which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants), and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils1 (of which there are about 70).
1 Whitley Councils are representative bodies for negotiation and joint consultation between
managements and staffs; the councils are named after Mr. J. H. Whitley, former Speaker of the
House of Commons and chairman of a committee which investigated industrial unrest from
1916 to 1919.
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is intended to compare fairly
with that paid for similar work outside the service, and usually he receives annual
increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to which he belongs. In addi¬
tion, although a civil servant holds office at the pleasure of the Crown and may there¬
fore be dismissed at any time, in practice he enjoys a considerable measure of security
of tenure. Thus every permanent civil servant may reasonably expect a full career in the
public service, and a pension on retirement—though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘conditioned’ to a given number of hours of attendance
a week. Oveitime is paid to members of most of the lowrer salary groups if they wTork
longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week for office staffs is
42 hours in London and 44 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies according to
grade up to a maximum of six weeks, i.e. 30 working days, a year. Sick leave on full
pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be granted to established civil
servants for up to six months in any twelve months, and on reduced pay up to a
maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Officially, the position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which a civil servant, as a
private individual, is free to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: (1) the unrestricted, which
includes all industrial staff, post-office-counter clerks, postmen, cleaners, messengers,
and similar workers, who are free to engage in all kinds of national and local political
activities, although, if intending to stand for Parliament, they should resign before
nomination day, since a serving civil servant cannot sit in the House of Commons;
(2) the intermediate, which includes typists, clerical assistants, clerical officers, and
analogous grades, who are free to engage in all political activities, except parliamentary
candidature, subject to certain conditions and with the permission of their departments;
and (3) the restricted, which includes all civil servants not in the other two groups.
This last group is barred from taking part in national political activities, but may seek
permission to engage in local political activities, subject to certain conditions.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, e.g., at a general
election or at local authority elections.
The Government is not concerned with the private political views of its servants,
except where there are duties in which secrecy is so vitally important to State security
that it does not feel itself justified in employing any one to carry them out whose
reliability is in doubt; therefore no one who is known to be a member of, or actively
associated with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations is employed in
connection with such work. Otherwise, every civil servant may engage in such private
activities as he wishes, provided that these do not in any way conflict with his official
duties, nor with the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the
Prevention of Corruption Act of 1906. A civil servant must not, however, use his
official position to further his private interests; and he is therefore subject to restrictions
in matters of commerce and business from which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g.,
he may not hold private interests in public contracts; and he may not use official
information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval of his
department. Above all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high standards of
integrity which characterise the service to which he belongs.
GOVERNMENT
69
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by popularly elected bodies
charged with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants
of a particular district or place and vested with powers to make by-laws1 for their
guidance.
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape, however, it dates back
only to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive system
of localty elected councils to manage various services provided for the benefit of the
community was first incorporated in statute law.
Since local authorities were established, their responsibilities have progressively
increased. They were charged with the management of most of the social services
that were created or expanded during the first forty years of the present century;
and after the second world war, although certain of their functions (e.g., those connected
with hospitals and gas and electricity supplies) were transferred to other authorities,
they were given additional duties and powers in connection with the general health and
welfare services, the care of deprived children, town and country planning, civil
defence, and clean air.
The Local Government Act, 1958, and the Local Government and Miscellaneous
Financial Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1958, made changes in the local government
financial system of Great Britain to give greater independence to local authorities in
the spending of money in their own areas; the English Act also provided for some
devolution of responsibility for county services to the councils of some of the larger
county districts, and established machinery for the review and alteration of local
government areas and authorities in England (outside Greater London) and Wales.
Relationship between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament, which require or permit elected local councils
to implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of local govern¬
ment is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the bounds fixed for its
activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision: Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorisation of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory instruments, the approval of by-laws, and the administration of Exchequer
grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England and Wales; in Scotland the
Scottish Home Department is generally responsible for local government; and in
Northern Ireland the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland are
divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative counties
(outside London) are further divided into three types of county district: non-county
boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts, which are themselves sub-divided
1 Laws of local application which must be approved by the appropriate minister.
7°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Each of these divisions is administered
by a different kind of local authority, as follows:
England and Wales1 2
county councils (61) rural district counciis
county borough councils (83) parish councils (some 7,500) or
non-county borough councils (318) parish meetings (some 3,300).
urban district councils (564)
Northern Ireland
county councils (6) urban district councils (25)
county borough councils (2) town commissioners (1)
borough councils (9) rural district councils (31).
Scotland
The local authorities in Scotland are:
county councils (33, of which two pairs are combined for certain purposes)
town councils (198, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4; other
large burghs, 20; and small burghs, 174)
district councils (199: two counties are not divided into districts).
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those in the
rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
metropolitan borough councils (28).
Constitution of Councils
Local councils comprise a number of elected councillors (and, in some cases,
aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who has varied
ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work on the council In
most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern Ireland the chairman is "the
Mayor; in the City of London and certain important boroughs, the Lord Mayor;
in the Scottish counties, the Convenor; and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
Local Government Commissions
Local authority areas, even when administered by the same type of local council,
show great variations in density of population and territorial size. This diversity
has tended to increase during recent decades, and, as a result, two Local Government
Commissions have been established to review the general county and county borough
pattern in England (outside the Greater London area) and in Wales respectively, and
m special review areas (Tyneside, West Yorkshire, South-East Lancashire, Merseyside
and the West Midlands) the district pattern and the distribution of functions as well.
The commissioners are required to make recommendations for such changes in the
pattern as may appear to them desirable after investigating the circumstances of local

government in each area under review, and after consulting the relevant local authorities
and other interested bodies and persons. The final proposals of the commissioners
may be given effect by ministerial order, with or without modification. Their recom¬
mendations (and any ministerial order) are to be submitted to Parliament.
The system and the working of local government in the Greater London area are
being examined by a Royal Commission set up by Royal Warrant in 1957 to recom¬
mend whether any, and if so what, changes in the local government structure and the
distribution of local government functions in the area, or any part of it, would secure
more effective and convenient local government.
Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as it may be required to provide and administer
by an Act of Parliament. It may provide additional services under the permissive
powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by Adoptive Acts or by local
or Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows: in
England (outside the County of London) and Wales and Northern Ireland, county
borough councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them, which they exercise
independently to a considerable extent, although (except in Northern Ireland) there
is a certain degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils,
especially of duties connected with town and country planning and the education,
health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings have a few functions
which they may exercise of right.
The broad principle underlying the distribution of powers and duties between the
London County Council (LCC) and the metropolitan borough councils is that all those
powers and duties which require uniformity of action throughout the whole of London
are administered by the LCC, while those that can be locally managed are vested in
the borough councils. In the City of London (an area of approximately one square
mile in the centre of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers
administered and duties performed by the metropolitan borough councils, and also a
number of functions which, in the rest of London, devolve on the LCC. The City
Corporation is not, however, an all-purpose authority, since certain services in the
City, e.g., education, are administered by the LCC.
In Scotland, the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and the district councils all share in
local government work.
The services provided by local authorities are generally classified under three heads—
environmental, protective and personal.
Environmental Services are designed to secure and maintain satisfactory standards
in the citizens’ surroundings. The majority are public health and sanitary services
administered in England and Wales by the county, county district, or parish
councils (in London by the metropolitan borough councils), in Northern Ireland
by the county, county borough, borough and district councils, and in Scotland by
the county and town councils, e.g., the inspection and abatement of nuisances,
drainage, sewerage, street cleansing, refuse collection and disposal, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, for litter control, and rodent control, and the provision of baths
and washhouses. There are also the services for bridge and highway construction
72
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and maintenance, for street lighting, public safety on the highways, and the pro¬
vision of amenities such as parks and recreation grounds, which are generally
administered by the same authorities and also, in part, by district councils in
Scotland. Town and country planning is carried out in England and Wales by
the county councils, which may delegate certain of their powers to county district
councils, and in Scotland by county councils and the town councils of large burghs.
The all-purpose authorities (county borough councils in England and Wales and
town councils in the counties of cities in Scotland) usually provide and administer
all their own environmental services.
Protective Services include the fire service, the civil defence service and the
police. The fire service is administered throughout England and Wales by the
county borough councils and the county councils, or by joint authorities (or
joint committees) set up by such councils. In Scotland, the fire service is adminis¬
tered by eleven fire authorities: the town council of Glasgow and ten joint com¬
mittees of the councils of counties and large burghs. Responsibility for organising
local divisions of the Civil Defence Corps in England and Wales is vested in the
county and county borough councils (including the LCC), a few county district
councils, the London metropolitan borough councils and the Common Council
of ihe City of London; and in Scotland in the town councils of cities and large
burghs and county councils. The police service is administered by standing joint
committees of county councillors and magistrates in the counties of England and
Wales, by watch committees in the county boroughs, or by committees consisting
of representatives of the constituent authorities in the case of combined police
districts. In London, the Court of Common Council has jurisdiction over the
police force in the area of the City and the Home Secretary is the police authority
for the metropolitan police district. The police authorities in Scotland are the
county councils, the town councils of certain large burghs, or joint boards for com¬
bined forces. In Northern Ireland, the police and civil defence services are adminis¬
tered directly by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the fire services (except in the
county borough of Belfast) are the responsibility of a separate statutory authority.
Personal Services are intended to promote the well-being of individual citizens.
The type of authority concerned depends on the nature of the services, which
range from health services, education, and housing to the provision of entertain¬
ments. The services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the pro-
ision of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some residential and
day nurseries; the supervision of the midwifery service; the provision of health
visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and
the after-care of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision of domestic
help where necessary; the ambulance service; the provision of facilities for vaccina¬
tion and immunisation against certain infectious diseases; and the services for
the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged and infirm and for children
deprived of a normal home life. Education and culture are promoted by the
establishment and maintenance of various types of schools; by the provision of
adult education centres, and art and technical colleges; by the award of grants and
scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the provision of libraries, art galleries
and museums. Local authorities provide living accommodation by building new
houses or by acquiring and converting suitable existing ones. Most houses owned
by local authorities are for letting, but they may, in certain cases, be offered for
sale. Councils may also make loans to persons wishing to buy privately owned
GOVERNMENT 73
houses; and they are responsible for ensuring that houses unfit for human habitation
are demolished or closed.
Local authorities engage in trading services, e.g., passenger transport, water supply,
and harbour, dock and pier services, but to a lesser extent than in the past.
Local Authority Elections
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government
is three years; aldermen hold office for six years. In some local authority areas the
whole council retires every third year and another is elected immediately; in other
areas elections are held annually, when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure
at local government elections is governed by rules laid down by the Representation
of the People Act, 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age or over on the
qualifying date and a British subject, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject
to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the area for
which the election is held. In Great Britain, a person qualifies for registration as a local
government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he
or she is resident in the area or occupies as owner or tenant any rateable land or premises
in the area of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in order to
qualify for registration as a local government elector, a person must have been born
in Northern Ireland, or alternatively, have resided continuously in the United Kingdom
for seven years immediately prior to the qualifying date and must have either a resident
occupier’s qualification, or a general occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, under
the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the purpose. The procedure for
local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that for parliamentary elections,
although facilities for postal voting are more restricted.
Every candidate for election as a councillor stands either as a representative of one
of the national political parties, or as a member of an association representing some
local interest, or as an independent. Each must be nominated by two electors, as
proposer and seconder; and in England and Wales (except in elections for metropolitan
borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils) eight other electors for
the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland, each county and district council
candidate requires a proposer (but no assenter) and each town council candidate a
proposer and five assenters. Candidates must be of British nationality over 21 years
of age and must (1) be registered as local government electors in the register of electors
for the area for which they seek election, or (2) have resided within that area during
the whole of the twelve months preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case
of parish councils), or (3) in England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in
the area. Candidates are also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed
to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by electoral
regulations made by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These
regulations are, in general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though diffei-
ing in certain particulars; for example, the town clerk or the clerk to the council is
the returning officer for all elections to the authority; there is no postal voting and
the only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Just as Great Britain as a whole is divided into constituencies for the purpose of
parliamentary elections, so, for local council elections, most local authority areas
74
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
e tirndcci into electoral districts. Administrative counties are split up, in accordance
with orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Minister of
Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland, into ‘electoral
divisions . Boroughs, urban districts and rural districts in England and Wales, and the
arger burghs in Scotland, are either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are small, left as
single units. In rural districts, the wards are based on parishes which, if large enough
may themselves be split into parish wards.
Outside London, county divisions each return one member. The LCC electoral
divisions (which cover the same areas as the London parliamentary constituencies)
return three members each; in other types of local authority area, each ward may return
one or more members.
Internal Organisation of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
their responsibilities. Questions of policy and principle are usually decided by the
whole council, which appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration
of its various services. The more important of the committees of the larger authorities
divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in a
relation similar to that of the mam committees to the whole council. The execution
of the policy decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried officers
and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small rural
district to several thousand in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs
part from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those known as ‘statutory’ committees
are constituted according to individual requirements and not according to any set
pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however, they may be divided into
two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be
further divided into statutory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; standing committees, which are appointed in accordance
wi the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis according to the extent
of the council s business; and special committees, which a council may set up for a
limited period to deal with a particular problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than one authority
They are usually established for services that can be more effectively administered
over a wider area than that controlled by a single council, e.g., town and country
planning, water supplies and the police service.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
uties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or in the
case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative scheme.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in connection
with raising loans, levying rates, or raising precepts (financial demands) which are
legally reserved to the council as a whole.
Officers and Employees
Over one million people (including teachers, transport staff and building workers)
are employed in local government service in Great Britain. Certain posts e g the
clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health, are compulsory in almost all
GOVERNMENT
75
councils, but, apart from these., councils are free to fill such other posts as they deem
necessary for carrying out their work. Choice of personnel is also left to a great extent
to the individual council; in theory, the appointment of certain chief officers is subject
to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of the council is nearly always
accepted.
As a general rule, officers are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief officers,
whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate
officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers
who are employed to do the physical work for which the council is responsible. Senior
staff appointments are usually made at the instance of the committee or committees
particularly concerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments,
who are also responsible for engaging the manual labour required. Appointments and
engagements are always made in conformity with a set establishment, and committees
are informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the jurisdic¬
tion of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an officer requires
the approval of a Government department, as in the case of the clerk of a county
council in England and Wales). They are based on recommendations made by the
Whitley Councils, of which there are several, including the National Joint Council
for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Services,
the National Joint Industrial Council for Local Authorities’ Non-Trading Services
(Manual Workers), the National Joint Council for County Council Roadmen, and, in
Scotland, the Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities
(Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In England
and Wales, conditions of service and salary scales for senior local government officers
are determined by special negotiating machinery.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct;
as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local Government Finance
Total local authority expenditure on current and capital account amounts annually
to over ^2,000 million. Income derives from Exchequer grants (paid in Northern
Ireland by the Government of Northern Ireland), from local rates, from loans, from
trading receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants finance more than half the net expenditure by local authorities.
The largest single grant is the general grant which is paid in aid of local revenues
generally, by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to county and county
borough councils in England and Wales, and by the Secretary of State for Scotland
to county and town councils in Scotland. The general grant replaces specific grants
which were previously paid for education, health and welfare services, town planning,
fire services, child care, road safety, police traffic patrol, physical training and recreation,
and a few other services. The total sum of the general grant is fixed in advance for a
period of two or more years and allocated among the authorities according to a formula
based mainly on objective factors, such as size and distribution of population, and
numbers of school children. In fixing the total amount, the Government takes into
consideration the current rate of expenditure on the services concerned, any probable
fluctuation in the demand for those services, the need for developing services, and the
extent to which, having regard to the general economic condition of the country, it is
reasonable to develop them. If, during any grant period, an unforeseen rise in the general
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
76
level of prices, costs or remuneration occurs and its effect on the cost of providing the
services covered is of such magnitude that it is felt that it ought not to fall entirely on
local authorities, the ministers are empowered to adjust the amount of the grant. They
also have power to reduce the allocation of any authority (subject to parliamentary
confirmation) if they are satisfied that that authority has failed to achieve or maintain
reasonable standards in the provision of the relevant services in comparison with the
standards achieved in other areas.
Other Government grants are: percentage grants, of which the two principal
examples are those for the police service and highways; unit grants, e.g., housing
subsidies; rate deficiency grants (Exchequer equalisation grants in Scotland), which
are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer local authorities to enable
them to bring their services up to a higher level of efficiency; and assigned revenues,
which are the proceeds of certain national taxes handed over to local authorities, e.g.,
game and gun licences and licences for hawkers, pawnbrokers, money-lenders and
refreshment houses and, except in Scotland, dog licences.
Rates, which are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers of land and buildings
in a local authority area as contributions to the cost of local services, provide about
one-third of the total income of local authorities. They are levied by a poundage on
the rateable value of property, which in England and Wales is equivalent to the rent
which the property might reasonably be expected to command if let from year to year
with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of insurance and repairs. There are
certain statutory reliefs from rate liability, notably for agricultural land and buildings,
which are entirely exempt; for industrial and freight transport premises, which are
rated at 50 per cent of the net annual value; and for such buildings as shops and offices,
the rateable values of which are generally 80 per cent of their net annual value.
Valuation for rating is undertaken by the valuation officers of the Board of Inland
Revenue; appeals may be made to local valuation courts, each consisting of three
members of an independent local valuation panel, and thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland, valuation has hitherto been based primarily on the annual rent actually
payable, valuation on a basis similar to that in England and Wales will come into force
in 1961. Valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each valuation area
and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session. A Scottish
\ aluation Advisory Council has been established by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the City
Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance themselves
by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan borough
councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required; parishes are
financed by rates levied by the appropriate rural district council on property within
the parish as an addition to the general rates. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town
councils in burghs and by county councils elsewhere; to cover their expenditure,
district councils issue a requisition each year to the county council; a town council
has to meet an annual requisition from the county council in respect of the burgh’s
share of the expenditure on functions exercised by the county council throughout the
county, including the burgh. In Northern Ireland, county councils are responsible
for making, levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as fall
within the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for financing capital expenditure,
subject to the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the
GOVERNMENT
77
Secretary of State for Scotland, who are guided by the recommendations of the Govern¬
ment department responsible for the service for which the capital is required. Borrowing
powers for specific purposes are sometimes included among the provisions of local
Acts; the London County Council seeks parliamentary sanction every year to raise the
money it needs for capital expenditure.
Loans may be raised by issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange, by internal borrow¬
ing, by private mortgage, or (to a more limited extent than formerly) from the Public
Works Loan Board which is financed by the Exchequer and from which slightly more
favourable rates of interest can be obtained.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. In England and Wales, an external audit is carried out (except
for certain general accounts in most of the county borough and about two-thirds of
the borough councils) by district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government. County borough and borough councils must use the services of
the district auditor for accounts which relate to education, national assistance, children,
local health services, coast protection, motor tax, rate collection, fire, civil defence and
town and country planning, but they may employ other auditors to do the remaining
work. In Scotland, all accounts are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the
Secretary of State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern
Ireland by special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Health and
Local Government.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a measure
of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England and Wales) and the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in Northern Ireland are controlled
by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority,
which are responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United
Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
In i960, there were 135 local authority fire brigades in England and W ales and 11
in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act, 1947, separate fire brigades are
administered by the county or county borough councils, which are the fire authorities
for their areas and have powers and duties which they exercise either separately or as
combined authorities where neighbouring councils care to make such arrangements to
increase the efficiency of the service. The London County Council is in direct control
of the London Fire Brigade. In Scotland, the local authorities are grouped in eleven
areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town council
of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered by a joint committee
representative of the councils of the counties and large burghs in the area.
Central Control
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland are empowered to
make regulations prescribing such matters as the maintenance of discipline, qualifica¬
tions for appointment, promotion, and pensions in local fire brigades, and their approval
is necessary for certain reductions on establishment schemes. In matters affecting the
78
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
fire brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and similar matters), each minister is
advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of
representatives of the local authority associations, representatives of the chief officers
(firemasters in Scotland) and other members of the brigades, and other persons having
special qualifications. The advisory councils are not concerned with the conditions of
service of members of the brigades; on these subjects the National Joint Council for
^°ca! Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain and the National Joint Council for
Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain are the negotiating
Central control is also exercised through the inspectors of fire services, whose
duties include advising the ministers on technical matters. In i960, there were 12
inspectors and assistant inspectors and one woman staff officer in England and Wales,
and one inspector and one assistant inspector in Scotland.
Establishment Schemes
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and location
o fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered necessary for the
provision of an all-over cover of its area. While details of establishment schemes vary
considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned, there are, in the whole of
England and Wales approximately 20,000 whole-time and 14,000 part-time firemen,
operating almost 4,000 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable ladders’
water tenders, and emergency and salvage tenders) housed in some 1,600 fire stations’
n Scotland, there are approximately 2,050 whole-time and 2,600 part-time firemen,
600 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire stations.
It is the duty of each fire authority to purchase such vehicles and equipment as are
required under the establishment scheme. Equipment is standardised, and appliances
are bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications, which ensure that essential
standards are maintained and yet allow sufficient freedom of design to meet local
requirements.
Operational Methods
Each fire authority is required to appoint a chief officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for the fire services in its area.
The appointment must be ratified by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The chief officer or firemaster is responsible to the fire authority
or seeing that both the fire brigade and the fire department (which is the administrative
centre and staff headquarters for the fire brigade) are organised and managed in
accordance with policy laid down.
There is a central headquarters for operational control, which is exercised on a local
basis by divisional officers in charge of geographical divisions into which most areas
are divided. Each divisional officer has at his disposal a small staff of whole-time, and a
varying number of part-time, officers and men; and he is responsible for mobilising
this force in the strength necessary for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division.
Constant communication is maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters,
and if at any time an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional
force, help is sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the
area of another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of area
boundaries.
GOVERNMENT
79
In England and Wales, the average number of fire calls a year totals about 175,000,
including those for chimney fires. In addition, there is an annual average of 25,000
special service calls for such purposes as rescuing persons and animals trapped in
dangerous situations, dealing with crashed aircraft, and pumping and salvage
operations. During the past ten years, some 2,500 lives have been saved through fire
service operations. In Scotland, the average number of fire calls a year, including
those for chimney fires, is 24,750; the average number of special services is 1,050, and
the number of persons rescued through fire service operations during the past ten
years was 1,145.
Firemen
Only a little over half of the total number of firemen are whole-time. The part-time
firemen include retained firemen who, in return for a small retaining fee, undertake to
attend fires if called upon; volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration; and
auxiliary firemen, who, as part of the local authority civil defence organisation, are
enrolled as members of individual fire brigades, and whose activities in peace time are
restricted to such duties as are desirable for training. In addition, there are the fire¬
fighting organisations with specialised functions, e.g., those maintained by the War
Office, Air Ministry, Ministry of Aviation and Ministry of Transport, and by some
large industrial and commercial concerns.
Ranks in the fire services (for men) are chief officer, assistant chief officer (fire¬
master and assistant firemaster in Scotland), divisional officer, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. Ranks in the women s>
branch, which is mainly concerned with controls, administrative duties and duties
of a clerical nature, are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer, assistant group
officer, senior leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and firewoman. Promotion in the
lower ranks of the fire-fighting forces is by examination and by merit, and in the higher
ranks by merit only.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and W ales receive practical
training and theoretical instruction in a number of subjects, including physics,
chemistry, hydraulics, building construction, industrial processes and the law, at
training schools run by fire authorities and refresher courses arranged by fire depart¬
ments. In Scotland, similar training is carried out at a central training school which is
the responsibility of the Scottish Home Department. Courses for officers and potential
officers of fire authority brigades are held at the Fire Service College, at Wotton
House, near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home Department as the central training institution for the fire services. The college
also provides courses for fire prevention officers.
Finance
Each fire authority submits to the Home Secretary or to the Secretary of State for
Scotland an annual statement showing its expenditure and income in connection with
the provision of fire services during the preceding year ; the local authorities bear the
cost of maintaining the services, the Exchequer contribution being included in t e
general grant.
Research
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire-fighting is directed mainly
by the Joint Fire Research Organisation; the cost of its work is shared equally between
8o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Government and the Fire Offices’ Committee (a committee of the insurance com¬
panies dealing in fire risks). The organisation controls a fire research station at which
practical tests are carried out.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an establishment
of 190 officers and men manning 13 appliances, while the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 44 other stations through¬
out the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 94 whole-time officers and men
and 650 part-time firemen, manning 69 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority—fire force commander, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer,
senior company officer, company officer, section leader (retained brigades only)’
leading fireman and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief officer, deputy
chief officer, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer, station officer, sub-officer,
leading fireman and fireman.
Finance
The Fire Services Acts (Northern Ireland), 1947-56, provide that the amount of
fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire Authority should be 50 per
cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure which do not exceed £60,000,
and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which the loan charges exceed £60,000,
together with 50 per cent of the first £150,000 of other net expenditure and 25 per cent
of the excess over that amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is
apportioned among the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the
authority. Under the Fire Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for
the payment of fire service grant.
III. LAW AND ORDER
THE LAW
The maintenance of public order in the United Kingdom is effected, generally
speaking, by two agencies—the judiciary and the police. Both are concerned in
different ways with the obedience of the citizen to the law.
Law is said to be based on the concepts of order and compulsion. In the legal
sense, it has been defined as any rule which will be enforced by the courts; as it applies
to a country, it is usually understood as the set of rules by which the citizens of that
country will expect to regulate their conduct in relation to their fellow citizens and to
the State.
There is no written code of law in the United Kingdom. The question whether
a particular rule is recognised as law is determined, where possible, by consideration
of the authorities—statutes, common law, and the opinions of legal writers of estab¬
lished reputation (although these are not law until accepted as such by the courts).
If none of these authorities exist, the judge uses a process of analogy: that is to say, he
bases his decision in a case on its similarity to a previous case in which judgment has
already been given.
Common law originated in the customs of the realm, and has been built up by the
decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law, known as ‘equity’, came
into being during the Middle Ages to temper justice with mercy where conscience
was opposed to the rigours of the law, and to provide and enforce more effective
protection for existing legal rights; later, it became a separate body of legal rules. In
I^73> the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so that all courts
now apply both systems, but where they conflict, equity prevails. Statute law includes
Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate legislation made under powers
conferred by Parliament.
The Treaty of Union between England and Scotland in 1707 included the provision
that Scotland should retain its own system of law, and differences in law and legal
procedure between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom remain. The Scottish
common law, unlike its English counterpart, has, in general, preferred broad principles
to strict adherence to judicial precedent, and has often adopted and adapted ideas from
other legal codes; and there are separate Scottish statutes in many fields of legislation.
Nevertheless, the very close links that have been forged between England and Scotland
since 1707, and the steady increase in the number of Acts of Parliament that apply
uniformly throughout the United Kingdom, have narrowed the gap between the legal
systems of the two countries until the points of similarity have become as numerous
as the differences, and there is now a considerable volume of law common to both
countries.
The leading branches of the law in the United Kingdom, as in most other countries,
are civil law and criminal law. The purpose of civil law is to uphold private rights, and
to redress private wrongs which do not involve moral guilt. Criminal law deals with
wrongs considered injurious to the community, and consequently punishable by
the State.
81
82
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
JUDICIAL PROCEDURE
English law provides that if anyone is arrested or detained otherwise than upon
aw ul grounds1 he may sue out a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained
him this person then being required to appear before the court on the day named
to show cause for detention. If no cause can be shown, the prisoner must be released
forthwith, and thereafter he has the right to sue the person who detained him for
assault or false imprisonment. In England and Wales, the writ of habeas corpus
may be granted by the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court or by any judge of the High
Court, in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary has a similar power to release persons
unlawfully detained.
Arrest to enforce a court order in civil proceedings can be effected only on a warrant
of the court. In criminal cases, arrest may be effected on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on information laid before it. In certain cases, it may also be effected without
warrant; but in these circumstances, the arrest is not lawful if the person making it
had no reasonable grounds for his action, and civil or criminal proceedings may then
be taken by the person aggrieved.
Anyone arrested on a criminal charge must be informed at once of the reason
for his arrest (except when he is caught in the act) and brought speedily for trial
before a magistrates’ court, sitting in public. When the arrest is without warrant, a
police officer may release the defendant on bail: that is to say he may discharge him
temporarily, subject to his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a
reasonable sum of money, to appear in court at the time appointed for the trial. Unless
the offence is serious, bail must be granted if the defendant cannot be brought before
the court within a day. Magistrates also have discretion to grant bail, and this discretion
is liberally exercised according to well-established principles. If bail is refused by the
magistrates, the defendant is always entitled (unless charged with treason or murder)
to apply to the High Court for bail, and he must be informed of this right.
Prosecutions
In England and Wales, there is, in general, no restriction on the right to institute
proceedings; in fact, most criminal prosecutions are initiated and conducted by the
police representing the public, but a private citizen may institute proceedings if he
wishes to do so. In some cases, the consent of the Attorney General or the Director of
Public Prosecutions or, less frequently, a Government department is required before
prosecution can be initiated. The Director of Public Prosecutions is also concerned
with prosecutions in all the more serious classes of indictable offence. There are certain
categories of crime which the police are required to report to him in order that he
may decide whether or not he proposes to conduct the prosecution personally, and he
may take up any case which appears to him to need his intervention. He is obliged to
prosecute in cases of murder, and in cases referred to him by a Government department
provided that he considers such cases to justify the institution of criminal proceedings;
and it is his duty to give advice to chief constables and other chief officers of police.
In courts where there is a good deal of work done by the Director of Public
Prosecutions, for example, the Central Criminal Court in London, there is a panel of
counsel appointed by the Attorney General, known as Treasury Counsel, who are
retained to prosecute in the Director’s cases.
1 These are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for civil debt (this is now permitted only where

LAW AND ORDER
83
The cases handled by the Director of Public Prosecutions amount to about 8 per
cent of the total number of prosecutions for indictable offences. Another 4 per cent
is accounted for by prosecutions brought by public bodies who handle their own cases,
and by those brought by private individuals. The remaining 88 per cent are police
prosecutions.
In Scotland, private prosecutions or prosecutions by the police are virtually excluded.
All prosecutions are instituted in the public interest by the Lord Advocate or his
officers or by prosecutors appointed by the burgh or justice of the peace courts.
Process of Criminal Prosecutions
Criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt has been con¬
clusively proved by the prosecution. Therefore, it has long been the custom to deny
to the prosecution any advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. The Judges’
Rules,1 formulated for England and Wales in 1912, forbid anything in the nature of
cross-examination by the police once they have actually charged a person with a crime,
and require that if such a person wishes to make a voluntary statement, he must first
be cautioned that anything he says may be used in evidence; while in Scotland, although
there is no exact replica of the Judges’ Rules, the courts will reject as evidence state¬
ments made by the accused, unless they are satisfied that these statements have been
fairly obtained. Private interrogation before an examining magistrate prior to public
trial forms no part of criminal proceedings.
Every accused person has the right to employ a legal adviser for the conduct of his
defence, and if he cannot afford to pay for legal representation, he may apply for legal
aid at the public expense (see p. 93). This is granted at the discretion of the court,
except in the case of a person charged with murder, who must be granted legal aid if
his means are insufficient. Anyone remanded in custody may be visited in prison by his
legal adviser, so that his case may be properly prepared. During the preparation of the
case, counsel for the defence has the right to compel the prosecution to disclose all the
documents in its possession which have a bearing on the case, and he may require
that these documents be produced at the trial, if such a procedure would seem advan¬
tageous to the defence. During the trial, the accused has the right to hear and sub¬
sequently to cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call witnesses on his own account, who, if they will not attend the trial
of their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’ or legally compelled to attend; and to
address the court either in person, or through his counsel. But he cannot himself be
questioned, unless he consents to be sworn as a witness in his own defence. The right
to cross-examine a prisoner, even when he is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object
of excluding inquiry into his character or into past offences not relevant to the particular
charge on which he is being tried.
The Jury System
Generally speaking, all the more serious crimes, i.e. crimes known as indictable
offences because a formal written accusation or ‘indictment’ is required for their
prosecution, must be tried in a superior court before a jury. In English law, however,
certain specified indictable offences may be dealt with instead at a magistrates court
if the defendant consents. Conversely a criminal case which would ordinarily be dealt
with in a magistrates’ court must usually be heard before a jury if the offence is punish¬
able by more than three months’ imprisonment and the defendant elects to be so tried.
1 These Rules do not have the force of law, but they carry great weight.
84
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A jury consists of twelve persons duly summoned in pursuance of a precept from
the court. Most property owners and ratepayers (men and women alike) are liable
to be summoned for jury service if they are British subjects and are between the ages
of 21 and 60, unless they are disqualified as, for example, having been convicted of an
infamous crime. Members of certain professions are, however, exempt from service,
and no person can be summoned to serve on any jury more than once in any one year
unless all the jurors on the list have already been summoned to serve during that
same year.
In trials by jury it is, broadly speaking, the duty of the judge to determine questions
of law (including questions as to the admissibility of the evidence), and to acquit the
accused or pass sentence, according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone
decides the issue of guilt or innocence. The judge sums up the evidence for
the benefit of the jury, but he never accompanies it when its members retire to
consider their verdict. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous; if its members are
unable to reach agreement, the case must be retried before a new jury. Members of
the jury are completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive. Moreover,
although both the prosecution and the defence have the right, before the trial opens,
to object to any member of the jury on the ground of his lack of impartialitv, once all
the members have been sworn in they are free from interference of any kind, even if,
as sometimes happens, they bring in a verdict in apparent contradiction to the summing
up of the judge. It is an offence to assault, threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman
either before or during a trial.
Scottish legal procedure differs from the foregoing in a number of respects: notably,
the verdict may be by a bare majority of the jury (which in Scotland consists of fifteen
persons in criminal cases and twelve in civil cases) and, in addition to ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’, may also be given as ‘not proven’. This verdict (which does not exist in
English law) involves acquittal in the same way as ‘not guilty’.
In England and Wales, either party may insist on trial by jury in civil courts in
cases involving claims for defamation, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment,
seduction, or breach of promise to marry, and a person charged with fraud may also
claim the right. Other civil cases are tried by jury only if the court, in its discretion,
so orders on the application of one or both parties to the dispute. Where there is no
jury, the trial is by judge alone. In the trial of a civil action, the jury is responsible for
deciding questions of fact (as in the trial of criminal cases) and also the amount of
damages to be awarded to the injured party.
Jury trial in civil cases is a more commonly used procedure in Scotland1 than in
England and the procedure in civil courts in Scotland differs in some respects from
that in English courts.
At certain inquests at coroners courts (see p. 89) in England and Wales, a jury is
required to be present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person
died. The jury in this instance consists of not fewer than seven and not more than
eleven jurors. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether
objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
Law of Evidence
Evidence in the legal sense is all the legal means, exclusive of mere argument,
which tend to prove or disprove any matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted
1 It js recommended by the Strachan Committee (which was appointed by the Secretary of
State for Scotland in 1957 and issued its report in 1959) that civil jurv trials should continue
m the Court of Session but should be abolished in sheriff courts.

to judicial investigation. In general, the law relating to it is the same in criminal and
in civil trials; but, because of the peculiar nature of a criminal trial—the gravity of the
issue, the extent to which the public interest is involved and the penalty to which
the prisoner may be subjected—some of the rules, as they relate to the proof of the
case against the prisoner, are applied with greater rigour and severity in the course of
criminal than in the course of civil proceedings. Thus, hearsay evidence (oral or written
statements made by persons not called as witnesses) is not as a rule admitted; and
although the uncorroborated evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law,
sufficient, a conviction solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is, in
practice, never allowed, unless the judge has warned the jury of the dangers of convict¬
ing without corroboration. In Scotland, apart from a few statutory exceptions, no
person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses, or corrobora¬
tion of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly implicate the accused
person in the crime.
Admissions by an accused person before trial are accepted as evidence in a criminal
trial only if they were made voluntarily without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
The previous history of the accused may only be used against him if he has
either expressly set up his own virtuous character as an argument for his innocence,
or attacked a witness or the prosecutor, or given evidence against a co-defendant, in
which case, should he choose to give evidence himself, he may be asked questions
about his own previous convictions, provided that they are relevant and not too remote
in time.
THE COURTS
The courts that apply the law in the United Kingdom are, broadly speaking, divided
into civil and criminal courts. No hard and fast line can be drawn since the
distinction is a comparatively modern one and, in fact, quite a number of civil cases
are heard in criminal courts, while occasionally a criminal case may be heard in
what is primarily a civil court.
Civil Courts in England and Wales
The more important of the civil courts in England and Wales are:
County Courts
County courts are so arranged that there is no part of the country more than a
reasonable distance from one of them. They deal with the great bulk of civil litigation;
over a million cases are entered in them every year, although comparatively few ever
reach the stage of trial, many being settled out of court. County courts are presided
over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may sit with a jury.
There are 74 county court judges now in office.
Most of the county courts (of which there are nearly 400) do not sit continuously,
so that one judge can preside over several courts. However, if pressure of business is
so great as to cause delays in the administration of justice in any district, the Lord
Chancellor may, on representations made to him by the judge of the district, appoint
a person (who must previously have held office as a judge or have been a barrister
of at least seven years’ standing) to act for the judge at any sitting of the court.
The ordinary jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil actions where the
amount claimed is less than ^4°° or where, in actions for the recovery of land, the
rateable value of the land is not more than j£ioo a year. Cases outside these limits may
be tried by consent of the parties, or may be transferred to the High Court. In certain
classes of case these limits do not apply: these include rent restriction cases and certain
86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cases under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954, and the Hire Purchase Act, 1938.
Other actions, in particular actions for libel and slander, cannot be brought in the
county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval borough
courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but the Liverpool Court
of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s and City of London Court
are still comparatively well used.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, which
largely took its present form in 1873. It: is composed of the High Court and the Court
of Appeal.
The High Court sits in three divisions: the Queen’s Bench Division, the Chancery
Division, and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. These divisions derive
from the old courts of the same names which existed before 1873, and cases are distri¬
buted between them as tradition and convenience dictate.
The Queen’s Bench Division is staffed by the Lord Chief Justice and 27 puisne
judges, i.e. judges without special office of their own. The work of the division includes
actions for damages and for debt, commercial cases and actions for the recovery of
revenue; the same judges also try criminal cases on assizes.
The nominal head of the Chancery Division is the Lord Chancellor; the work of the
division is done by six puisne judges who remain in London all the time. The juris¬
diction of the Chancery Division derives from the equity system and its work covers
actions for the administration of the estates of deceased persons, partnership actions,
actions connected with trusts and mortgages, some tax cases, the care of infants’
estates, and company and bankruptcy matters.
The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division deals, as its name implies, with the
proof of wills; with Admiralty and shipping cases; and with divorce cases, heard
either before High Court judges or before specially appointed divorce commissioners
—often county court judges.
Appellate Courts
There are two appellate courts in civil law actions—the Court of Appeal, which is
part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and the House of Lords.
There are several ex officio members of the Court of Appeal, but its effective head
is a judge called the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eight Lords Justices of
Appeal. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from the county courts, the Mayor’s and
City of London Court and all divisions of the High Court. The Court of Appeal
generally sits in three divisions, each of three judges.
From the Court of Appeal, a further appeal is possible to the House of Lords,
with the leave of the House of Lords or of the Court of Appeal. Such appeals are
usually heard by five of the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who are paid pro¬
fessional judges with peerages for life. In addition, the Lord Chancellor and any
peers who have held high judicial office are entitled to sit. The House of Lords is the
supreme court of appeal in civil cases in the whole of the United Kingdom.
Civil Courts in Scotland
Sheriff Courts
Sheriff courts in their civil capacity correspond roughly to county courts in England
and Wales, but they have a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of the case. Scotland

is divided into 12 sheriffdoms, each provided with a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-
substitute. The work of the sheriff court is normally done by a sheriff-substitute, against
whose judgment an appeal may be made to the sheriff or directly to the Court of Session.
Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices of
the peace.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session is the supreme civil court in Scotland. It was established in
1532 and consists of 15 judges. The court is divided into two parts—the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court, and the Outer House, a court of first instance, where,
inter alia, all actions for divorce are taken. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges; the first division being presided over
by the Lord President, and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the
Inner House, an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural matters.
The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity of a judge
of the Court of Session.
Criminal Courts in England and Wales
The criminal courts in England and Wales include:
Petty Sessional or Magistrates' Courts
Magistrates’ courts are courts of summary jurisdiction where persons accused of
all kinds of minor offences and a large number of the less serious indictable offences
may be tried without a jury. Over 97 per cent of all persons convicted are convicted
at magistrates’ courts. These courts are also used for committal proceedings, i.e. the
public conduct, by magistrates, of preliminary inquiries into indictable offences to
determine whether or not an accused person should be committed for trial in a higher
court. The average time which elapses between committal for trial by magistrates and
the start of trial in a higher court is about five weeks.
The majority of magistrates’ courts consist of not fewer than two and not more than
seven unpaid ‘lay’ magistrates or justices of the peace, who are appointed, in each
county and for each borough which has its own commission of the peace, by the Lord
Chancellor, who is advised as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant with the assistance
of an advisory committee, and as to boroughs by separate advisory committees. There
are also a few persons who are authorised by statute to act as justices, by virtue of
holding some other public office, e.g., mayors of county and non-county boroughs and
chairmen of county councils.
In central London, most of the courts consist of metropolitan stipendiary (paid)
magistrates sitting alone. There are, at present, 29 such magistrates and the Lord
Chancellor has power to appoint additional acting metropolitan magistrates for limited
periods when the number of cases to be tried is exceptionally high. Some of the larger
towns also have stipendiary magistrates.
Juvenile Courts in England and Wales are specially constituted magistrates’ courts
which deal with young people under 17 years of age who are charged with any offence
except homicide, or are brought before the courts as being in need of care or protection
or beyond control, or as persistent truants. Juvenile courts also deal with most
applications for the adoption of children.
D
88
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Outside the London magistrates’ courts area, the justices for each petty sessional
division elect from their number a panel of justices specially qualified to deal with
juvenile cases. The panel for the London area is appointed by the Home Secretary.
A juvenile court consists of not more than three justices drawn from the panel and
must, except in special circumstances, include a man and a woman. A juvenile court
must sit either in a different room or building from that in which other courts are
sitting, or on a different day. Only persons within certain specified categories are
admitted and only limited publicity is allowed.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom one
should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is separated
from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
Courts of Quarter Sessions
There are two different kinds of quarter sessions—county sessions and borough
sessions; both are normally held four times a year, although, when necessary, additional
sittings may be held.
The jurisdiction of quarter sessions covers all but the most serious indictable
offences, but the courts are debarred from trying any crime that carries the death
sentence or (subject to certain exceptions) imprisonment for life.
Each of the 65 courts of county quarter sessions is presided over by a legally qualified
chairman or deputy chairman, who may or may not draw' a salary, sitting with a
number of the magistrates of the county. In London, Lancashire and Middlesex,
where the courts have continuous sittings, the chairman and deputy chairman usually
preside alone. In the 96 boroughs w'hich hold separate quarter sessions, most of the
courts, which do not sit continuously, are presided over by a Recorder (usually a part-
time judicial officer), who is a salaried barrister, as sole judge. Trial by jury applies at
both borough and county sessions.
Assizes
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court of Justice. They are held in the
county towns and in certain big cities three times a year, a Queen’s Bench judge or
a Commissioner of Assize (who may be a barrister commissioned to act as a judge)
presiding. The assize judges work on circuits covering England and Wales, and travel
from one county town to another in the course of their duties. They can try any
indictable offence committed in the county.
At the winter and summer assizes, civil business as well as criminal may be taken,
but, except in a few large towns, the autumn assize is confined to criminal cases.
Crown Courts
Crown courts are courts at Liverpool and Manchester which act as courts of assize
in and for the W est Derby Division of Lancashire and the Salford Division of
Lancashire. They also act as courts of quarter sessions for the cities of Liverpool and
Manchester. The Crown courts are presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and
Manchester, who are whole-time judicial officers.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey acts as the court of assize for the
criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the home counties. The judges
include: a judge chosen, in rotation, from the Queen’s Bench Division for each monthly
session of the court; the Recorder of London; the Common Serjeant; and two additional
judges of the Mayor’s and City of London Court.
LAW AND ORDER
89
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be brought on a point of law by either the prosecutor or the defendant
direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more usual appeal is
that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence, which is heard in the
counties by the Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions, consisting of between three
and twelve magistrates, and in the boroughs by the Recorder.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or Crown
courts go to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Appeals on questions of law may be brought
as of right, but on other grounds, only by leave. The Lord Chief Justice usually
presides in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which consists of three or, in special cases,
five judges of the Queen’s Bench Division.
Under the Administration of Justice Act, i960, a further appeal from the Court of
Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a
point of law of general public importance is involved and it appears to the court or
the House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
Criminal Courts in Scotland
Criminal prosecutions in Scotland are mainly dealt with in the sheriff courts sitting
under summary procedure, i.e. the sheriff without a jury. Minor offences are tried
under summary procedure in police courts in burghs and in justice of the peace courts
in counties. Any summary court may sit as a juvenile court when hearing charges
involving only persons under 17 years of age and, in some areas, there are specially
constituted juvenile courts. The sheriff court also sits under solemn procedure, i.e.
the sheriff with a jury, to hear the more serious cases prosecuted on indictment.
The most serious cases are taken under solemn procedure in the High Court of
Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court of first instance. It consists of the Lord
Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session), the Lord
Justice Clerk and thirteen Lords Commissioner of Justiciary who are also judges of
the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit
to preside at trials in other towns. The High Court of Justiciary is also the appeal
court from the summary courts and, sitting as a court of criminal appeal, hears appeals
in indictment cases. Appeals are heard by three or more judges; there is no further
appeal to the House of Lords. There is no counterpart in Scotland to committal
proceedings by the committing magistrates, the only public hearing being the trial
itself.
Courts in Northern Ireland
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England
and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community. The main
difference is that all petty sessional cases are dealt with by resident magistrates, who
correspond to the stipendiary magistrates of England and Wales. The inferior courts,
that is to say the courts where the less serious cases are tried, are administered by the
Parliament of Northern Ireland; the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament.
Coroners’ Courts
Where a person appears to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden
death of which the cause is unknown, and in certain other circumstances, the death
must be reported to the local coroner, who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by a county or a county
9o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
borough council. When a death is reported to the coroner, it is his duty to inquire
how, when, and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this
purpose, and he must hold an inquest if he has reasonable cause to believe that the
deceased has died a violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances
for which an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. A jury must
be summoned in certain cases, including those in which there is reason to suspect that
the death was due to murder, manslaughter, or infanticide, or was caused by an accident
arising out of the use of a vehicle on the public highway. If the jury returns a verdict of
murder, manslaughter or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner commits
that person for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest, but may order a post-mortem
examination to ascertain the cause of death.
The discovery of gold or silver objects hidden in the soil or in buildings must be
reported to a coroner, if the original owner cannot be traced. The coroner then holds an
inquest with a jury to inquire whether the objects are ‘treasure trove’ and who was the
finder thereof. If it is decided that the objects are treasure trove, then, though the law
is that treasure trove vests in the Crown, the declared finder will either receive them
back or be paid their full market value.
In Scotland, the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires
privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may report the result
of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown Counsel may consider what
proceedings, if any, are required.
Ecclesiastical Courts
The established Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts, which constitute
a graduated hierarchy. They include the Court of the Archdeacon, the consistory
court of the bishop of each diocese and the provincial courts of the archbishops of
Canterbury and of York.
The ecclesiastical courts, which are still courts in the full sense of the word, have
jurisdiction only in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Administrative Tribunals
A number of administrative tribunals exist in various parts of the United Kingdom
for the exercise (under chairmen, usually appointed by the Lord Chancellor or the
Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland) of special judicial functions;
broadly speaking they fall into three groups :
(1) those which deal with a class of dispute in which a Government department
or public authority is interested, e.g., local valuation courts (rating), general
and special commissioners of inland revenue (income tax), and pensions appeal
tribunals;
(2) those which deal with a class of dispute where specialised knowledge or
experience on the part of the tribunal is required, e.g., the Lands Tribunal
(assessment of values of interest in land), rent tribunals (assessment of fair
rents for furnished premises), and the Restrictive Practices Court (investiga¬
tion of restrictive trading practices); and
(3) those which enforce professional discipline, e.g., the General Medical Council
(doctors), and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society (solicitors).
Appeals from certain of these tribunals lie to the appropriate minister (if there is
one) or, on a point of law, to the superior courts of England and Wales, Scotland
or Northern Ireland, as the case may be.
LAW AND ORDER
91
An advisory Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and
the Secretary of State for Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over the tribunals
and reports on particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the
Scottish committee of the council.
Military Courts
Appeals lie to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and from that court to the House of
Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance is involved
and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be
considered by the House.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary of the United Kingdom is independent. That is to say, it is free to
administer the law under the protection of the law without fear or favour. All judges,
from those of the House of Lords and the superior courts to stipendiary magistrates
and justices of the peace, must not only be, but must appear to be, completely impartial,
for it is of fundamental importance that ‘justice should not only be done, but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s courts in that ‘all jurisdiction
of the courts is either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’, but since
the end of the seventeenth century it has been established that the executive
cannot disturb or delay the course of common justice, attempt to force the judges
to act otherwise than impartially, or use the prerogative powers of the Crown to create
courts to administer any system of law other than common law. Judges always have
been, and still are, selected from the ranks of practising barristers; and neither their
training nor their career is in any way influenced by the State.
The independence of the judiciary vis-a-vis the legislature is likewise strictly
observed. Originally laid down by the Act of Settlement, I70I> the law governing
the matter was re-enacted in the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,
1925, which provides that all judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal,
with the exception of the Lord Chancellor (who is a member of the Cabinet), shall
hold their offices during good behaviour, subject to a power of removal by the Sovereign
on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament. During the centuries that have
passed since 1701, only one such address has been moved (against a judge convicted of
misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can be stated with confidence that Parliament
would never use this means to attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similar!},
although no court in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act
of Parliament which had been duly passed, legally promulgated, and published by the
proper authority, it might, through its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision
contrary to the policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case,
it would be open to the Government to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the
statute, or to pass a new Act. It would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to try
to influence the court in any other way.
Administration of the Judicial System
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. The central responsibility
for the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales lies partly with the
Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary. The Prime Minister is also
1 Excluding supervision of the professional disciplinary tribunals, with which the ordinal-
public are not concerned.

concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown the appointment
of the Lords Justices of Appeal and that of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.
Judges of the High Court are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of
the Lord Chancellor, who appoints justices of the peace and is also responsible for
recommending to the Crown the appointment of county court judges (except in
Lancashire where they are nominated by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster),
recorders of boroughs and metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. The
administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the appointment of
court officials is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the hands of
the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with legal procedure in
that he is a member of the Rule Committee which makes the rules of the Supreme
Court, and that he appoints the County Court Rule Committee and has power to alter
or disallow the rules made by it. He is also concerned with law reform in that he refers
questions on this subject (save in the field of criminal law, where the Home Secretary
is primarily responsible) to the Law Reform Committee and the Private International
Law Committee, and that the reports of these committees, which often become the
basis of legislation, are presented to him.
The Home Secretary is responsible for the general administration of magistrates’
courts in England and Wales, except in relation to their judicial functions in which
they can be controlled only by the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court. He
is also responsible for approving appointments of clerks to justices made by magistrates’
couits committees, of which there is one for each county and county borough and for
certain non-county boroughs. Magistrates’ courts committees exercise local respon¬
sibility for the administration of magistrates’ courts.
In Scotland, the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord Justice Clerk.
Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies with the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session are adminis¬
tered by the Clerk of the Justiciary and his staff and the principal Clerk of Session and
his staff respectively. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the appoint-
ment and removal of justices of the peace and for the staffing and general organisation
of the sheriff courts.
THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The legal profession is divided into two classes of lawyers—barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. No hard and fast line can be drawn between their work,
since there are many barristers who do little advocacy, and there are solicitors who do
little else, and who have made considerable reputations for themselves in the courts in
v hich they are permitted to appear; but in general, it may be said that solicitors
undertake legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct legal proceedings in the higher courts.
A barrister is required to have reached an accepted educational standard, to have
passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education and to
have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s
Inn, the Middle ffemple and the Inner Temple. A barrister with a substantial junior
practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him Queen’s
Counsel a proceeding that is known as ‘taking silk’. Most of the higher judicial
appointments are made from among barristers who have become Queen’s Counsel. The
professional conduct of a barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the
Bar; but disciplinary powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
LAW AND ORDER
93
A prospective solicitor must be considered suitable by the appropriate committee
of the Law Society (the professional organisation of solicitors) and he must enter into
‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before
he can begin his professional career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years,
depending upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must
pass the necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a
barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend a course
of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he may become a
member of the Law Society.
In Scotland, the conditions for admission as, and the standing of, advocates and
solicitors are much the same as those applying in the case of barristers and solicitors
in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the Faculty of
Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland;
there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. For solicitors, the
professional organisation is the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland.
LEGAL AID
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and Wales, and to
a somewhat greater extent in Scotland. These schemes were revised, and extended
to include the provision of free legal advice, by the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949,
and the corresponding Legal Aid (Scotland) Act, 1949, which were introduced both
to improve existing arrangements in civil proceedings so that no one would be financially
unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and also
to make the facilities already available in criminal proceedings more easily accessible
to those who needed them. The Acts also provided for the remuneration from public
funds of solicitors and barristers acting for persons receiving legal aid.
Owing to the financial situation at the time, the 1949 Acts could not be fully imple¬
mented and, at first, only those clauses relating to legal aid in civil proceedings before
the High Court and the Court of Appeal in England and Wales, and before the Court
of Session and the sheriff courts in Scotland, were brought into force. During i960,
however, legal aid in England and Wales was extended to civil cases in county
courts and certain local courts of similar standing; and to matrimonial and affiliation
proceedings in magistrates’ courts and courts of quarter session. Furthermore, certain
procedural changes in the operation of the free legal aid system in the criminal courts
were brought into force during i960, including the transfer from local to central
government funds of the costs of the defence in criminal cases in which legal aid is
granted. The sections in both the English and Scottish Acts providing for legal aid in
matters not involving litigation and for oral legal advice have also come into force.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons whose disposable income does not
exceed £250 a year, and whose disposable capital is £125 or less, and contributory
legal aid to those whose disposable income does not exceed £700 a year and whose
disposable capital is less than ^500> or suc^ other figure as may be prescribed. An
assisted person is liable for a maximum contribution towards the cost of his case of a
third of the sum by which his disposable income exceeds £250 a year.
For the purposes of the legal aid scheme, England and Wales are divided into twelve
areas. In each area a committee of solicitors and barristers, known as an area committee,
94
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is responsible for the administration of the scheme. These committees are responsible
for setting up local committees to which anyone seeking legal aid may apply. The
committees hear the facts, and if they consider that there is zprima facie case they give
it their support. The person who wishes to bring the action is then allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor and, if necessary, a barrister, to conduct his case. Application
for legal aid in appellate proceedings is to the area committees. Certain types of action,
including libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
Legal aid is operated through the Law Society under the general guidance of the
Lord Chancellor. The cost is met from the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources:
contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation;
and a grant from the Exchequer.
In Scotland, the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of Scotland
through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court committee and sixteen
local committees. An applicant for legal aid in Scotland is required to show ‘probable
cause’ and produce in support of his application a statement corroborated according to
the requirements of Scottish law.
Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is available in the criminal courts in England and Wales under the
Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, 1930, and, in case of appeal, under the Criminal Appeal
Act, 1907, and the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933. Under the Costs in
Criminal Cases Act, 1952, the courts are empowered, in the case of an indictable offence,
to order the reasonable costs of the defence to be paid out of local funds to the accused
if he is discharged by the magistrates’ court or acquitted. The Act also gives a magis¬
trates’ court power, if it dismisses an information on summary trial, to order such costs
as it considers just and reasonable to be paid to the accused by the prosecutor.
Under the legal aid scheme, the scale of fees for counsel in criminal cases in the higher
courts ranges between ^8 13s. and ^64 10s., and for solicitors, between £6 6s. and
£78 15s., depending upon the nature of the work done. The maximum fees may be
exceeded in difficult cases.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons in Scotland under the Poor’s
Roll system, which is administered on a voluntary basis by the legal profession with the
help of a grant from Government funds.
In Northern Ireland, free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945. The cost of providing free
legal aid is met from public funds.
Legal Advice
Oral advice on legal matters is given by practising solicitors (paid out of the Legal
Aid Fund at the rate of £1 for every half-hour) without charge to those having less
than £75 capital (excluding the value of their dwelling house, furniture, clothes and
the tools of their trade), and for 2s. 6d. to those having an income in the seven days
preceding the application of less than £4 10s., after deducting 30s. if married and main¬
taining a spouse, 25s. for each dependent child, and 30s. for any adult dependant, as
well as income tax and national insurance, industrial injury or national health
contributions.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal system of the United Kingdom are to deter the potential
law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of deterrence lies in
LAW AND ORDER
95
the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility of punishment rather than in the
severity of the punishment itself. The treatment of offenders today is based increasingly
on the recognition that the community has a responsibility not simply to punish or
reject the lawbreaker but to prevent him from returning to crime.1 Research into the
causes and prevention of delinquency which, according to statistics, has shown a
marked increase since the end of the second world war, is at present being undertaken
by a research unit in the Home Office, by a number of universities and by other bodies
concerned with these problems. An Institute of Criminology has recently been
established at Cambridge University.
Penalties
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a fixed
penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima prescribed
by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circumstances of the offence
and the offender. In general, the courts have power to impose either imprisonment
or a fine for serious offences (both in certain cases); while most minor offences are
punishable by a fine only, with the alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid.
Moreover, the court has discretion, instead of sentencing an offender, to discharge
him absolutely, to place him on probation or, in England and Wales only, to discharge
him conditionally (i.e. subject to the condition that he commits no offence during a
specified period not exceeding twelve months). There are special provisions governing
the treatment of young offenders; and the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act, 1949, provide that no court shall sentence a person under 21
years of age to imprisonment unless they consider that no other method of dealing with
him is appropriate. Magistrates’ courts in England and Wales are subject to a similar
restriction in sentencing adult first offenders to imprisonment.
Two special types of treatment—corrective training and preventive detention—
have been devised to deal with the persistent offender. A sentence of corrective training
of not less than two nor more than four years (seven years in Northern Ireland) may
be imposed on offenders of 21 years of age or over if they are convicted of an offence
punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more and have been convicted
of such an offence on at least two previous occasions since attaining the age of 17.
Sentences of preventive detention (primarily for the protection of the public) may be
imposed on persons of not less than 30 years of age, who are found guilty of offences
punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more and have been convicted
of such offences on at least three previous occasions since attaining the age of 17, and
have been sentenced to borstal training, imprisonment or corrective training on at
least two of these occasions. A sentence of preventive detention runs for not less than
five years (three in Northern Ireland) or more than 14 years, as the court decides.
Since 1957, the death penalty for murder has been confined to those forms of murder
(known as ‘capital murder’) which strike most directly at the maintenance of law and
order and the public peace, i.e. murder done in the course of furtherance of theft,
murder by shooting or by causing an explosion, murder committed to escape lawful
arrest or to effect or assist escape or rescue from legal custody, murder of a police
1 Some aspects of treatment of offenders were examined in Penal Practice in a Changing Society,
Cmnd. 645, published in 1959. The treatment of young offenders was further discussed in the
report of the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Young Offenders, published later in 1959.
A Government decision to implement certain proposals made in these documents will mean the
virtual ending of short-term imprisonment for young offenders.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
96
officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his duty, or murder by a
prisoner of a prison officer (or person assisting him) acting in the execution of his
duty. The penalty for murder not in capital categories is imprisonment for life, except
that the death penalty continues to apply where a person who is convicted of murder
has previously been convicted of another murder committed in Great Britain on a
different occasion. Murderers under the age of 18 years at the time that the crime was
committed are not sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, but ‘to be detained
during Her Majesty’s pleasure’. If it can be proved that a person accused of murder
was suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental
responsibility at the time he committed the murder, he is entitled to be convicted of
the lesser offence of manslaughter.
It is the long-established practice for the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State
for Scotland to review every capital case before the law is allowed to take its course
and to consider whether there are grounds for advising the Crown to exercise the
prerogative of mercy. Where a reprieve is recommended, the sentence of death is
commuted to one of imprisonment for life. A person subject to a sentence of life
imprisonment is liable to be detained for the rest of his life, but the Home Secretary
may, if he thinks fit, release him on licence at any time. In recent years, the average
period served by persons whose death sentences have been commuted has been about
nine years, but the period varies according to the circumstances of the particular
case and the question of whether the prisoner’s discharge would be likely to involve
risk to the public.
In Northern Ireland the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in all capital cases is
considered by the Northern Ireland Cabinet, which tenders advice to the Governor in
his capacity as representative of the Crown.
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales, the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible for
legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical and other
information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing the advantages and
defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and for bringing information about
these methods to the attention of the courts. He is specifically responsible for super¬
vising the approved schools, for promoting the efficiency of the probation service,
and for providing, maintaining and managing prisons and borstal institutions. In
the administration of prisons and borstal institutions the Home Secretary is
assisted by the Prison Commission, which is a self-contained department with a
separate parliamentary vote.
The Home Secretary is advised in the discharge of his duties as the central authority
for all questions relating to the treatment of offenders by the Advisory Council for the
Treatment of Offenders, which also acts as the National Working Party Group for
the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and as the National Committee
of the International Penal and Penitentiary Commission.
Responsibility to the Home Secretary for the formation and application of prison
policy rests with the Prisons Board, which consists of the five prison commissioners
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary, and an
establishment officer. The Prison Commission also comprises nine assistant com¬
missioners—one with special responsibilities for women’s establishments—who are
appointed from the governors of prisons and borstals, and are inspectors under the
Prison Acts. There are also a number of specialist directors, with appropriate
professional and technical staffs.
LAW AND ORDER
97
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting com¬
mittees appointed by the justices for those prisons to which convicted persons are
committed direct from their courts, or of boards of visitors appointed by the Home
Secretary for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of the committees
and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the prison or institution;
to constitute an independent judicial body to which any prisoner or inmate may make a
complaint or request; and to report direct to the Home Secretary, both by formal
annual report and as occasion may require, on every aspect of the administration of
the prison. In borstal institutions and central prisons for prisoners sentenced to
preventive detention, the boards also advise the Prison Commission on the release on
licence of the inmates.
The penal system in Scotland is based on principles similar to those applied in
England and Wales, and the Secretary of State for Scotland is advised in the discharge
of his duties by the Scottish Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders. In
Northern Ireland, the system is the responsibility of the Ministry for Home Affairs.
Prisons
The rising trend in the total number of indictable offences known to the police
has led to severe overcrowding in prisons and has strained the resources of other
agencies, such as borstals, approved schools and the probation service. Measures to
deal with the problems include plans for a substantial increase in the number of
prisons and the other institutions mentioned above, and the reconstruction or replace¬
ment of a number of old prisons.
Prisons in England and Wales are of the following types: local prisons of the ordinary
type, which receive all classes of prisoners direct from the courts; local prisons of a
special type, which may be open or walled, for short-sentence prisoners, chiefly first
offenders: four young prisoners’ centres for the reception of youths under 21 years of
age with sentences of three months or over, as far as accommodation permits; regional
training prisons (some of which are open) for first offenders and trainable prisoners
of other categories, including those sentenced to corrective training; and central
prisons for habitual law-breakers, prisoners sentenced to preventive detention and
long-term first offenders—one for the latter class is an open prison.
The Scottish system of classification of prisoners is broadly the same as that of
England and Wales; but each prison in Scotland, except the open prison, accommo¬
dates more than one classification group. In Northern Ireland, with its smaller popu¬
lation, the necessity for several kinds of prison to separate the various classes of
prisoners does not arise to the same extent. There are 48 prison establishments in
England and Wales, 9 in Scotland, and 2 in Northern Ireland.
Full-time prison officers of all ranks, except chaplains, are permanent civil servants.
In i960, their total number was over 9>500—about 8,500 (of whom 8 per cent were
women) in England and Wales; 997 (including 68 women) in Scotland; and 199
(including 20 women) in Northern Ireland.
Glassification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is received in the local prison serving the
court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole
sentence at the local prison or be sent to another institution, depending on his age,
the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil prisoners
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
98
from criminal prisoners; secondly to prevent contamination, among convicted prisoners,
of the better by the worse; and thirdly to provide training appropriate to their needs
for those among convicted prisoners who seem likely to benefit therefrom.
Training
In prison training efforts are being made to provide (1) work of a kind likely to
help to fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training in skilled
trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and (3) opportunities for
the development of a sense of personal responsibility, including (for suitable persons)
training in open conditions.
A system of vocational training courses in skilled trades, designed to enable the
trainees to take the examinations of recognised examining bodies, is being developed
in central and training prisons. In i960, there were 85 such courses, covering 26 different
trades in the various prisons, and the standard of training was such that just under 65
per cent of entrants passed the external examinations.
Employment
New problems in the organisation and management of industries in prisons have
arisen as the result of changes that have taken place both in industrial methods
and in the prison system during the past thirty years, and because of the substantial
increase in the number of prison inmates for whom employment must be found.
The whole subject is therefore being studied by an Advisory Council on the Employ¬
ment of Prisoners, which was appointed at the end of 1959 by the Home Secretary and
the Secretary of State for Scotland. The council is considering the supply of sufficient
and suitable work in prisons, the development of new forms of employment for
prison inmates and industrial training in prisons, and will advise the Government on
these and other matters.
Prison industries in England and Wales are controlled by a member of the Prison
Commission who, as the Director of Industries and Stores, has a head office staff of
technical officers, supervisors, and industrial managers at the prisons. An Assistant
Commissioner for Industries was appointed at the end of 1959 to help carry out any
recommendations which the Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners
may make. In Scotland, prison industries are under the control of the Supervisor
of Industries, who is a member of the Scottish Home Department and is assisted by
two technical assistants at head office and four industrial managers at the prisons.
Except in local prisons, where the hours are shorter, most prisoners spend about
40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in other employment such as building,
farm work, domestic work and gardening in the prison precincts. A few prisoners are
employed outside the prisons on various projects of public value, such as agriculture,
land drainage, road works, and forestry.
All prisoners are entitled to earn a limited amount from the first day of their sentence:
in England, Wales, and Scotland, these amounts may be increased for satisfactory
output after a specified lapse of time; in Northern Ireland, there is a progressive
system of earnings, which is not related to output or to work done.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales, and Scotland
by the local education authorities with the advice of the Government departments
responsible for education in their respective countries, and in Northern Ireland by
the Ministry of Home Affairs. The local authorities are reimbursed for the full cost
LAW AND ORDER
99
of their services, and the work in England and Wales is under the organisational control
of the Assistant Commissioner for Education in the Prison Commission. Evening
institutes have been established; and a wide range of correspondence courses is made
available for those who have a serious desire to improve their education and
qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays, concerts,
and dramatic performances. Prisoners may also use the prison library, which in most
cases is now stocked by the county, city or borough library committee.
Medical Services
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers under the
supervision of the Director of Medical Services at the Prison Commission. The Medical
Officer’s duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, but also the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
Three prisons and one borstal in England and Wales and three prisons and one
borstal in Scotland have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified medical staff,
visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to which inmates may be
transferred if, in the opinion of the relevant medical officer, they would benefit by
psychiatric treatment. Elsewhere, prisoners may, if necessary, be sent for treatment to
psychiatric hospitals outside the prisons. Arrangements may also be made (for prisoners
serving short-term sentences) for appropriate treatment after release. The building of a
central psychiatric prison hospital for England and Wales, with accommodation for
300 patients, was begun in 1959.
There is also a psychological service for prisons, whose officers are employed to
assist governors and medical officers in their work of examining and classifying
prisoners, and to advise on methods of treatment.
Religion and Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland and
in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland, and Presbyterian Church) and a Roman
Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the Methodist Church and
of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as required. Regular
services are held, and chaplains and other ministers may visit prisoners in their cells.
There is a chaplain inspector on the Prison Commission.
Welfare is usually the responsibility of the chaplain and welfare officers of local aid
societies; there are also 32 full-time prison welfare officers, including three in Scotland.
Prisoners may be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals and,
in England and Wales, by recognised prison visitors asked to serve in this field by
the Prison Commission. The voluntary work of these visitors is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Privileges and Discipline
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to preventive
detention or to imprisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their
sentence (one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two years),
provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days).
A prisoner sentenced to preventive detention becomes eligible for release on licence
after serving two-thirds or five-sixths of his sentence (in Northern Ireland, two years,
or one-half of his sentence, whichever is greater) according to an assessment of his
character, conduct and prospects, which is made after he has served a substantial
IOO
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
part of his sentence and a life prisoner may be released on licence by the Home
Secretary (see p. 96). All prisoners become entitled to certain personal privileges
at successive stages in their sentence.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting committee
or the board of visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission (or postponement
of the date of release) and forfeiture of privileges.
Discharge and After-Care
Pre-release courses, at which experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their
release on the domestic, social and industrial problems with which they are likely to
be faced, are conducted at all prisons. Specially selected men amongst those sentenced
to preventive detention and long-term imprisonment are allowed to work, as free men,
in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during the last six months of their sentence;
hostels for this purpose have been established at ten prisons in England where there
are reasonable prospects of employment and similar hostels are proposed for more
than one Scottish prison. Home leave, allowing five clear days at home, is extensively
granted to many categories of prisoners with sentences of two years or over towards
the end of their sentences to enable them to make family adjustments and contacts
with potential employers.
On discharge from local or regional prisons, prisoners serving sentences of less than
four years are assisted by local discharged prisoners’ aid societies (voluntary bodies
supported partly by private and partly by public funds) or by the National Association
of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies (a central co-ordinating body, maintained by
grants from public funds for its administrative expenses). The local societies are advised
by prison welfare officers, employed by the National Association, who work at the
prisons. In Scotland the prison welfare officers are employed by the Scottish Home
Department. The National Association is also responsible for welfare and after-care
arrangements at regional training prisons and special local prisons. For persons dis¬
charged from other prisons and from borstals (who are, in general, subject to statutory
supervision), after-care in England and Wales is in the hands of the Central After-Care
Association, a voluntary body financed from public funds and governed by a council
appointed by the Home Secretary, which includes in its membership representatives
of the Ministry of Labour, of the National Assistance Board and of the probation
service. The After-Care Council, appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland,
carries out similar duties in Scotland.
The National Association works through local associates, usually probation officers,
and the After-Care Council works through voluntary guardians. The officers of the
local organisations make all arrangements for the reception of the prisoner after his
discharge, and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is necessary, or
required by statute.
In Northern Ireland, the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the discharged
prisoners’ aid societies with the help of probation officers.
Treatment of Young Offenders
Under the English and Scottish legal systems, a child under the age of eight cannot
be charged with an offence. A child between eight and 14 years old, who is charged
with an offence other than homicide, must be dealt with in a juvenile court, unless
charged jointly with an adult.
In England and Wales, a young person between 14 and 17 years of age charged
with an indictable offence may be dealt with summarily (as is usually the case) or
LAW AND ORDER
IOI
committed for trial by jury. In certain cases young persons may claim to be tried by
jury, though this right is rarely exercised. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, all young
persons up to the age of 17 years who are charged with offences must be dealt with
in juvenile courts, unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult offenders.
The following methods of treatment are available in law for dealing with children
and young persons who have been found guilty of committing an offence: absolute
discharge; conditional discharge (in England and Wales only); fines imposed upon
the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents; probation; committal
to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate local authority) until the age of
18; or a period of detention in one of the different types of institution which are
available when institutional treatment is considered necessary.1
Remand
In England, Wales and Scotland, remand homes are provided by local authorities
for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their appearance in court,
or between court appearances (while inquiries are made as to the best method of
treatment for them), while they are awaiting vacancies in approved schools, or for a
short period (up to a month) of punitive detention. In Northern Ireland, the respon¬
sibility for providing or arranging for the provision of remand homes rests with the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, several remand centres are being established, to
which a court may send young persons between the ages of 17 and 21 who would
otherwise be remanded to prison, and those under 17 years old who are unsuitable
for remand homes. The building of the first remand centre began during 1959.
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for observation, the results of
which are included in reports for the guidance of those responsible for the future of
young offenders.
Approved Schools
Approved schools are residential schools for the education and training of young
offenders, and children committed to them by the courts as in need of care or protection.
These schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary organisations
concerned with the welfare of children on a national scale, or by local committees formed
by people interested in such work. In England and Wales, the schools must be approved
by the Home Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in
Northern Ireland, by the Minister of Home Affairs. The number of approved schools
in England and Wales in i960 was 117. There are 23 approved schools in Scotland, and
five (known as training schools) in Northern Ireland.
The schools are for boys only or for girls only. They are classified according to the
ages of the children on admission, and include separate schools for Roman Catholic
children. The assignment of a child to a school in the appropriate age group is deter¬
mined by such considerations as the location of the school in relation to the child’s
home, the type of training provided, and the probable reaction of a child to the
individual personalities of the staff.
In general, the education given in approved schools follows the lines of that given
in ordinary schools, with vocational training for older boys and girls: the emphasis
is on character building, and close attention is given to after-care.
1 A committee was appointed by the Home Secretary in 1956 to inquire into, and make
recommendations, inter alia, on the working of the law in England and Wales in respect of
young offenders; the constitution, jurisdiction and procedure of juvenile courts; and the remand
home, approved school, and approved probation home systems.
102
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The period during which a child or young person may be detained in an approved
school is determined by law. In Great Britain it is three years, except for children
under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal, who may be kept
until the age of 15 years and 4 months, and those over the age of 16 on committal,
who can be detained only up to the age of 19, or 19! if they have been found guilty
of absconding or of serious misconduct in an approved school. Managers of all approved
schools are under an obligation to review the progress of each child in their school
towards the end of the first year of detention and thereafter at least quarterly, with a
view to granting a release on licence as soon as the situation warrants it.
Statutory responsibility for after-care rests on the school managers. A boy or girl
on release remains under the care of the managers during the periods of licence and
supervision. The period of licence lasts until the expiry of the time for which the boy
or girl might have been legally detained in the school. The period of supervision
lasts for three years more, or until the boy or girl reaches the age of 21, whichever
is the shorter period. Managers are assisted in their after-care work by welfare officers
and the probation and child care services.
Attendance Centres
Thirty-nine attendance centres have been established in England and Wales to
deal with boys between the ages of 12 and 17 found guilty of offences for which an
adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is designed to teach
young offenders a respect for the law and to give them some instruction in the proper
use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must do so during their spare time on Saturday
mornings or afternoons; they may be required to attend for up to three hours on any
one occasion and for not more than twelve hours in all. I he activities include a period
of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture (e.g., on first aid) and a period of physical
training or disciplinary tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to
induce the boys to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
An experimental centre for youths aged 17 to 21 has been established in Manchester.
This operates on similar lines to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the activities
have been adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
Detention Centres
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a long
period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not seem necessary,
but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures as fines or probation.
Intended as a sharp sanction through a short, but strict, lesson, the treatment is
most effective for boys to whom a strictly regulated institutional life is entirely new,
the regime is brisk and disciplined, and the highest possible standards are required.
Each boy in a detention centre must be alert, punctual and tidy, and emphasis is
placed on the inculcation of obedience, cleanliness and good manners. The routine
provides a normal working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to
physical training. Boys of compulsory school age receive full-time education, and
classes of further education are provided for others in the evenings. In i960, there
were four detention centres in England and Wales1—two junior centres for boys over
14 and under 17 years of age, accommodating about 70 an(i boys respectively, and
two senior centres for youths over 17 and under 21 years of age, accommodating about
75 and 65 respectively. In Scotland, the first senior centre was opened in i960 and the
first junior centre will be opened in 1961, each with accommodation for 60 inmates.
1 The White Paper, Penal Practice in a Changing Society, envisaged the need for 12 detention
centres in all.
LAW AND ORDER
103
Borstal Institutions
There are various types of borstal institution, which aim to provide suitable con¬
ditions and training courses for different types of young offenders between the ages
of 16 and 21 years. For youths in England and Wales, there are two borstal allocation
centres, 19 training borstals, one correction centre and one recall centre; and there are
two open borstals, four closed wings and one recall centre for girls.1 In Scotland, there
are five training borstals and one recall centre for youths and one training borstal for
girls; and in Northern Ireland, one training borstal for youths and one for girls. The
period of the sentence ranges between a minimum of nine months detention to a maxi¬
mum of three years, with the total period of control extending to four years (three
years in Scotland and Northern Ireland), divided between training in a borstal
institution and controlled freedom under statutory supervision. In Scotland, the super¬
vision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution or until the
expiration of three years from the date of sentence, whichever is the shorter. The
system is essentially remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully
selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement, and many borstals are conducted in open conditions. An
initial period of classification ensures that each young offender is sent to the institution
best suited to his or her requirements.
Probation
The probation service2 is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while
he remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer, whose duty
it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the service is that it
relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a probation order, the court
must explain its effects and make sure that the probationer understands that if he fails
to comply with the requirements of the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the
original offence. A probation order cannot be made without the consent of the person
concerned unless (in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under 14
years of age. The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with
the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also
require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment for his mental con¬
dition. A probation order is made for not less than one year and not more than three
years.
Every magistrates’ court and superior criminal court must have available the services
of probation officers of both sexes. In i960, the total numbers were: 1,545 whole-time
and 52 part-time probation officers in England and Wales, 18 whole-time and one
part-time in Northern Ireland, and 154 whole-time and 29 part-time in Scotland. In
London, the appointment of probation officers is the responsibility of the Home
Secretary, and in Northern Ireland of the Ministry of Home Affairs; elsewhere it is
the respoksibility of probation committees appointed by magistrates in England and
Wales, and by local authorities in Scotland (except for certain ex officio members), but
all appointments are subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland respectively. Training facilities in England and Wales are
provided by the Home Office on the advice of the Probation Advisory and Training
Board and are made available, by arrangement, to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland,
1 These are temporary arrangements until a new closed borstal is built.
2 A departmental committee to inquire into and make recommendations on all aspects of the
probation service was appointed in 1959-
104
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
training is provided during the first year of appointment and before the officer is
allowed to make probation work his permanent career.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised and controlled on a local basis
under the guidance of those Ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the
maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales,
the responsible minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the Secretary of State
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the police force is controlled by an Inspector-
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 125 separate, independent police forces in England and Wales, defined
according to area of responsibility as county forces; borough forces; combined forces,
which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbouring counties or
boroughs; the metropolitan police force, which is responsible for an area of approxi¬
mately fifteen miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the City of London;
and the City of London force. In Scotland, there are 33 forces, including county
forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland, police forces vary considerably in size accord¬
ing to the area and population which they serve. Thus the metropolitan police force has
a strength of approximately 17,000, while that of the smallest force in Scotland is 16.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain in i960 was approximately
82,000, including women.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are part-time special constables;
the police of certain public services, e.g., the British Transport Commission police,
the civil aviation constabulary, the Port of London Authority police and other dock
and harbour forces (who have duties and powers analogous to those of ordinary
constables but limited to the premises and immediate neighbourhoods of their
employers); and the police of the Service departments—the Admiralty constabulary,
the War Department constabulary which guards War Office lands and military property,
the Royal Marine police who are employed chiefly in dockyards, and the Air Ministry
constabulary.
Police Authorities
In the counties of England and Wales, the police authority is the standing joint
committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while the other
half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs, the police authority is known as the
‘watch committee’ and is elected by the council from among its members. The police
authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the constituent areas as
prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
The police authority for the metropolitan police force is the Home Secretary. In
the City of London, the Court of Common Council is the police authority, although it
usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland, the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are responsible for the appointment of the chief
LAW AND ORDER
I05
officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary in the
provinces of England and Wales, of the Crown in the City of London, and, in Scotland,
of the Secretary of State. In the metropolitan police district, the chief officer of police
and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation
of the Home Secretary.
The police authorities are also responsible (with the approval of the Home Secretary
or the Secretary of State for Scotland) for the size of their forces; for paying the members
of the forces their salaries; for providing and maintaining police premises; and for
exercising disciplinary functions in relation to the most senior officers.
Central Authority
Co-ordination in the administration of the police service is exercised through detailed
police regulations which are made by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State
for Scotland under the Police Act, 1919, the Police (Scotland) Act, 1956, and under
the Police (Pensions) Acts. The police regulations cover such matters as organisation,
discipline, pay, allowances, pensions, clothing, and conditions of service of the members
of all police forces to which the Acts apply.
The Police Council for Great Britain, which is representative on the one side of all
ranks of the police service and on the other of the local police authorities, the Home
Office and the Scottish Home Department, has power to reach agreement on conditions
•of service in the police forces and on certain procedural matters. It also advises the
ministers on police pensions and any other matter which may be referred to it by
the ministers or any other body concerned. In their supervisory responsibilities the
ministers are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary, of whom there were
five (in addition to a woman assistant inspector for the women police) in England and
Wales, and one in Scotland in i960. Each inspector is responsible for a certain number
of forces, and satisfies himself of their continuing efficiency by annual inspection, ad hoc
visits and consultations when particular problems arise. The inspectors report to the
ministers on the condition of all the forces, with the exception of the metropolitan
police force, for which the Home Secretary has responsibility as police authority
and which is not inspected.
All police authorities receive a Government grant equal to half their net expenditure
reckoned in accordance with the provisions of orders made under the Miscellaneous
Financial Provisions Act, 1950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police
(Scotland) Act, 1946 (as regards Scotland). These orders empower the Home Secretary
and the Secretary of State for Scotland to withhold the grant, in whole or in part,
permanently or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a
police area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give whole¬
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
and special constables, who are volunteers who perform short periods of duty without
pay in their spare time from their normal occupations.1
1 In Scotland, the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is subject
to strict limitations.
io6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages of 19
and 30, although an exception may be made, in special circumstances approved by the
ministers and on the recommendation of the appointing authority, in the case of men
of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between the
ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. The standard police
ranks in Great Britain, except in the metropolitan police district, are: chief constable,
superintendent, inspector, sergeant and constable. The following ranks may also be
adopted in areas where varying degrees of responsibility make intermediate ranks
necessary: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent, chief inspector and, in
England and Wales only, station inspector, station sergeant and acting sergeant. In
the metropolitan police district the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; thereafter (i.e. from chief
superintendent downwards) the ranks are the same as in the rest of the country. In
the City of London the ranks are the same as in the provinces, except that the chief
officer is the Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an assistant
commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it. The Police Act, 1919, however, laid it down
that the police should have statutory representative organisations of their own. There
are now several organisations representing the various police ranks, including the
Police Federation in England and Wales and the Scottish Police Federation, to which
all inspectors, sergeants and constables belong. Any branch or committee of the federa¬
tions may make representations to the chief officer or police authority concerned, or
to the appropriate minister. Delegates from the joint central committees of the two
federations sit on the police councils.
Police Cadets
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among youths between 15 and 18
years of age, so that prospective constables shall have had some training and have
gained sufficient insight into police duties to make reasonably certain that they wish
to stay in the police service before they undergo constable’s training. A few forces
also recruit girl cadets.
Civil Staff
A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switchboard
operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release uniformed personnel
for police duties. In i960, the civil staff employed by the police authorities in England
and Wales (outside the metropolitan district) was 11-3 per cent of the actual strength
of the uniformed force.
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, a police officer is personally answerable at law for any
wrongful act. He is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his
duties must rely on his own good sense, discretion and knowledge of the law.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from the protec¬
tion of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic control to criminal
LAW AND ORDER IO7
investigation, the apprehension of offenders, and, in England and Wales, the preparation
and presentation of straightforward cases in magistrates’ courts.
All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and many
have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river police (in districts
which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch (for main¬
taining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years a number of common services have been established to supple¬
ment those provided by the police authorities for their own use. In England and Wales,
such services include a training service, which provides eight residential district
training centres and a central police college; an installation and maintenance service
of wireless equipment for the police; a forensic science service, which provides labora¬
tories for the use of regional groups of forces; and arrangements for conducting
centralised police promotion examinations. In Scotland, there is a central police college,
which provides training courses for recruits and courses of higher training; but the
installation and maintenance of wireless equipment is a direct charge upon the police
authorities concerned and there is no centrally run forensic science service. The
resources of the Glasgow police force’s criminal investigation department (which
includes a finger-print bureau and an extensive laboratory service) are, however,
made available to other forces, and the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow
and St. Andrews render assistance when required.
A number of national services are provided by the metropolitan police force, whose
functions in this respect include: (1) the maintenance of criminal records1 and finger¬
prints, which are available to all police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain
foreign forces; (2) the publication of the Police Gazette,2 which contains particulars
of people wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without
charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Commonw ealth
and foreign forces; (3) the organisation and control of the special branch of the criminal
investigation department at New Scotland Yard, whose duties include the physical
protection of royalty, some ministers, and distinguished foreign visitors; and (4) the
carrying out of extradition orders made by the courts. The metropolitan police force
also provides the United Kingdom bureau of the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol). For certain of these services, the metropolitan police force
receives an additional Exchequer grant.
Royal Commission on the Police
A Royal Commission on the Police, appointed in 1959, is reviewing the constitutional
position of the police throughout Great Britain and the arrangements for administration
and control. Particular matters to be considered by the commission are: the con¬
stitution and functions of local police authorities; the status and accountability of
members of police forces, including chief officers of police; the relationship of the
police with the public; and the broad principles which should govern the remuneration
of constables.
1 There are, in addition to the Criminal Record Office at New Scotland Yard, a central Criminal
Record Office in Glasgow, and regional criminal record offices in parts of England and W ales.
2 The central Criminal Record Office in Glasgow is responsible for the publication of the
Scottish Police Gazette.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector General,,
who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes the policing of the
whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the Northern Ireland Exchequer
with a nominal contribution from the county borough of Belfast.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in i960 was approximately 2,890,
including women. The Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a
deputy inspector general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector
for each of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each district
coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head constable or a
sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the police service
in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining to the various ranks are much the
same. Although the more senior ranks bear different titles, the ranks of head constable,
sergeant and constable are broadly equivalent to the three junior ranks in the Great
Britain police service.
The Ulster Special Constabulary also comes under the direction of the Inspector
General. In the main, this force is a part-time body, and, apart from training, its
duties consist in affording assistance to the Royal Ulster Constabulary on special
occasions; if necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be mobilised for full¬
time duty. In i960, the Ulster Special Constabulary included some 13,800 part-time
members (of whom about 1,600 were mobilised) and just over 100 full-time personnel.
IV. DEFENCE
THE DEFENCE SYSTEM
An adequate general survey of the principles which govern United Kingdom
defence policy is possible only in the wider context of the United Kingdom’s inter¬
national relationships, its place in the Commonwealth and in world affairs, and its
responsibilities towards British dependent and protected territories—subjects which,
as explained in the Introduction, fall outside the scope of this handbook. This chapter,
therefore, can attempt little more than an outline of the present pattern of the
development of Britain’s armed forces.
DEFENCE POLICY
The national defence policy has been increasingly based on the realisation that no
country can protect itself in isolation and the defence of Britain is possible only as
part of a system of collective defence. Policy is therefore determined largely by Britain’s
obligations to contribute to the collective defence organisations of which it is a member
—the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and Western European Union,
the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO, formerly the Baghdad Pact), and the
SEATO defence system in South-East Asia—and to contribute to the long-range
nuclear forces of the West, as well as to discharge its own special responsibilities in
many parts of the world; and defence planning is carried out in close co-operation
with Britain’s partners in these organisations.
Close liaison is maintained with other Commonwealth countries, between whose
forces there is considerable standardisation of equipment, weapons and training
techniques and interchange of personnel.
At the same time the United Kingdom continues to work for the attainment of
international agreement on the control of all forms of armaments.
Machinery of Higher Defence Planning
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests, under the ultimate control of
Parliament (which makes annual financial provision for defence needs), with the
Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Subject to this supreme responsibility, defence
problems which engage the collective responsibility of the Cabinet are normally handled
on the Cabinet’s behalf by the Defence Committee, meeting under the chairmanship
of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister determines which members of the Defence
Committee should attend particular meetings of the committee, according to the
subjects to be discussed and the ministerial responsibilities involved. The Minister
of Defence, who is a member of the Cabinet and of the Defence Committee, answers
to Parliament for all matters of policy common to the three fighting Services—the
Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force. The minister has authority to decide
(subject to the responsibilities of the Cabinet and the Defence Committee) all major
matters of defence policy affecting the size, shape, organisation and disposition of
the armed forces, and their weapons and war-like equipment and supply (including
defence research and development). He is also ministerially responsible to the Prime
Minister for the execution of military operations approved by the Cabinet or the Defence
109
no
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Committee. Recommendations for the more important Service appointments are sub¬
mitted by the Service ministers (the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of
State for War, who deals with the Army, and the Secretary of State for Air) for the
approval of the Minister of Defence, who, in appropriate cases, seeks the covering
approval of the Prime Minister.
The Service ministers, working through the Board of Admiralty and the Army
and Air Councils, are responsible for the efficiency and administration of the three
Services. The Minister of Aviation is responsible for the supply to the Services of
aircraft, guided and nuclear weapons, and electronic equipment. All these ministers
are members of the Defence Committee; consultation on defence policy between them
and the Minister of Defence and discussion of inter-Service problems take place at
meetings of the Defence Board, of which the Minister of Defence is chairman.
The Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the Chief of the Defence Staff
(who is principal military adviser to the Minister of Defence), as chairman, and the
professional heads of the three Services, is collectively responsible to the Government
for professional advice on strategy and military operations and on the military implica¬
tions of defence policy generally. Its collective advice is given to the Minister of
Defence by the Chief of the Defence Staff, who tenders his own advice, together with
the views of the other members of the committee, if the committee cannot reach
agreement. The Chief of the Defence Staff is responsible for issuing operational
orders, and he is entitled to call on the respective Chiefs of Staff to make available, to
assist him in his functions, the services of the Naval, General and Air Staffs. The
Chiefs of Staff are members of the Defence Board, are in attendance at meetings of the
Defence Committee and may be invited to attend meetings of the full Cabinet as
necessary; they have at all times a right of access to the Minister of Defence and, when
necessary, to the Prime Minister.
Britain’s defence policy is reviewed each year in a White Paper presented to Parlia¬
ment by the Minister of Defence immediately before the detailed Estimates of the
Service departments.
The White Paper for 1957—Defence: Outline of Future Policy (Cmnd. 124)—set out
a five-year plan for the reshaping of the defence forces in the light of changes in the
international situation, the rapid progress in military technology, and the need to
relieve the burden which defence requirements had been imposing on the country’s
financial and economic strength. This programme, described in the White Paper as
involving ‘the biggest change in military policy ever made in normal times’ is now being
put into effect, and progress during the first three years was reviewed in the White
Papers of 1958 (Cmnd. 363), 1959 {Cmnd. 662) and i960 {Cmnd. 952).
The Long-term Plan
Britain’s armed forces, the 1957 White Paper stated, must be able to perform two
main tasks:
(1) ‘to play their part with the forces of allied countries in deterring and resisting
aggression; and
(2) ‘to defend British colonies and protected territories against local attack, and
undertake limited operations in overseas emergencies.
‘The aim must be to provide well-equipped forces sufficient to carry out these
duties, while making no greater demands than are absolutely necessary upon man¬
power, money, and other national resources.’
The five-year plan provides for smaller, highly trained, all-regular forces with
increased mobility, equipped with the most modern weapons and organised on up-to-
DEFENCE
III
date lines. A central strategic reserve will be maintained together with the means of
transport, including airlift, to take it rapidly to the scene of any trouble. Since ‘the
over-riding principle must be to prevent war rather than prepare for it’, the organisation
and equipment of the forces are designed to deter resort to war.
The intention is that there should be no further call-up of men for National Service
after the end of i960 and that by the end of 1962 the armed forces should be composed
wholly of regulars. The plan involved a reduction of about 300,000 in the combined
strength of the three Services, which stood at nearly 700,000 (adult United Kingdom
males) in 1957.
DEFENCE AND THE ECONOMY
After the end of the second world war the strength of the armed forces had been
drastically reduced. It was not until growing world tension made it inevitable that
this trend was first halted and then reversed. Following the outbreak of war in Korea
in 1950, the United Kingdom embarked on a programme for building up its defence
forces, at a cost estimated originally at £4,700 million over a three-year period.
Between 1950 and 1953 annual defence expenditure was nearly doubled, rising
to some £1,400 million in 1952-53, and over the same period the total strength of
the active forces increased from just under 700,000 to a peak of about 875,000 at the
beginning of 1953. With the end of hostilities in Korea, the programme was revised
to meet the changed conditions and to keep it within the limits of the country s
economic resources in the face of rising costs. In place of a short rearmament spurt
there was substituted the policy of the ‘long haul’; the programme was slowed down
and spread over a longer period.
Nevertheless, the burden on the economy continued heavy. In 1953, defence
absorbed some 10 per cent of Britain’s gross national product, compared with 7 per
cent in 1950. In 1956, just before the launching of the five-year defence programme,
it was still absorbing almost 9 per cent; some 7 per cent of the working population was
either in the Services or supporting them, and one-eighth of the output of the metal¬
using industries—vital to the economy as a main source of exports—was devoted to
defence. The very heavy cost of maintaining large British forces abroad (which in
1956 involved expenditure of some £179 million in foreign currency) placed a severe
strain on the balance of payments. The total net defence budget in 1956-57 (after
allowing for receipts from United States aid under the Mutual Security Programme and
German contributions to the cost of British forces stationed in Germany as part of the
NATO forces) equalled more than one-third of total central Government current
ordinary expenditure.
The effects on the economy of the new defence policy announced in 1957 are
now making themselves felt. The proportion of the working population in the Services
or supporting them is falling (it is now estimated at just under five per cent), the claims
on the metal-using industries are being appreciably reduced (about one-ninth of the
output of these industries is at present being devoted to defence), and the call on
scientific and engineering skills is easing. Because of the increasing complexity of
modern weapons and equipment and the higher cost per man of regular forces, defence
expenditure cannot show a reduction proportionate to that in manpower. Defence
expenditure in 1960-61 is expected to represent about 7! per cent of the gross nationa
product, compared with nearly 9 per cent at the beginning of the five-year programme.
It still, however, accounts for about a quarter of total central Government ordinary
expenditure. In 1959, the expenditure in foreign currency for the maintenance of
British forces abroad amounted to some £17° million.

Current Defence Budget
The gross defence Estimates for 1960-61 totalled £1,629-83 million. After deducting
the contribution from the Federal German Government in respect of local costs
of British forces in Germany,1 the Estimate presented to Parliament for 1960-61
was £1,617-83 million.

Defence expenditure by civil departments in 1960-61 (including loan expenditure
by the Post Office) was estimated at £19-57 million.
MANPOWER
Each of the three fighting Services is at present made up of a combination of
voluntarily recruited regulars and men called up for National Service, and each includes
women volunteers who form part of the regular forces. An analysis of the strength of
the forces in April i960, with estimates for 1961, is given in Table 6.

In addition, reserve and auxiliary forces with training liability (volunteers and
part-time National Service men) totalled 549,700 at 1st April, i960.
1 Under an agreement announced in May 1958, the Federal German Republic is to pay £12
million annually for three years towards these costs: 1960-61 will be the last year in which a
German contribution will be received.
DEFENCE
JI3
The planned figures (United Kingdom adult males) for the all-regular armed
forces for 1962 are: Royal Navy, 88,000; Army, 165,000 (with a recruiting maximum
of about 180,000); Royal Air Force, 135,000. Arrangements for recruitment and training
of regulars are summarised for each Service separately later in this chapter. Pay and
pensions are reviewed at intervals of not more than every two years and other steps
are being taken to improve the conditions of Service life, including a five-year Service
building programme, estimated to cost £90 million.
A Regular Forces Resettlement Service, set up by the Minister of Labour in 1957,
assists regular officers and other ranks to find civilian employment on leaving the forces
(see p. 453).
National Service
Compulsory military service in peace time was first introduced in Britain in 1939,
shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Under the National Service Acts,
1948-55, fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26 ordinarily resident
in Great Britain are liable to serve for two years’ whole-time service in the regular
forces, and thereafter three and a half years’ part-time service in an auxiliary force.
Deferment of National Service may be granted to students and others undergoing
training, and to men who are employed in certain occupations in the national interest
(including coalminers, members of the Merchant Navy, secondary school teachers, and
those in agricultural employment), for as long as they are engaged in those occupations.
Postponement of call-up may also be granted on the grounds of exceptional domestic,
business or other hardship. Provision is made for bona fide conscientious objectors to
be relieved of the obligation for combatant military service. Men called up under the
National Service Acts have statutory rights to reinstatement in their former civil
employment.
Special arrangements have been made for i960, the last year of call-up, since the
number of men available for call-up is appreciably greater than is required by the
Services. Some 50,000 men whose deferment for training or study ended on or after
1st June, i960, are not being called up. The total of some 60,000 men left available for
call-up consists mainly of men whose deferment for training or study expired or was
terminated before 1st June, i960, and men born before 1st October, i939> who have
not been deferred.
The Ministry of Labour calls up the men from civil life for registration and medical
examination and posts them to the Services. The Army has been by far the biggest
user of National Service men. Sixty-nine per cent of all National Service men were
serving in the Army in April 1957, and 84 per cent in April i960.
Deployment Overseas
The deployment of United Kingdom forces is world-wide, in fulfilment of responsi¬
bilities under the regional defence organisations of which the United Kingdom is a
member, and for the defence of United Kingdom dependencies. A considerable part
of these forces is committed to NATO on the continent of Europe. Forces are also
maintained in the Middle East, the Far East, East and North Africa, and the Caribbean.
Where appropriate, inter-Service commands are being established overseas. In
October 1959, a single command was established for all United Kingdom land and
air forces in the Arabian Peninsula, Persian Gulf and British Somaliland, together
with the naval forces allotted to the Persian Gulf. This was followed in May i960 by
the establishment of a unified command for United Kingdom land and air forces in the
Middle East, with permanent representation of the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the
Mediterranean at Command Headquarters.

Staff Colleges
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or have
been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army Staff College
at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges at Bracknell (Berkshire)
and Andover (Hampshire), go to the Joint Services Staff College at Chesham (Bucking¬
hamshire), where they live and work together and where particular attention is paid
to the inter-Service aspects of staff work. This college caters for about 150 students
a year from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil Service, and other Commonwealth
countries. Finally, there is the Imperial Defence College in London, to which are sent a
few specially selected and more senior officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and
from other Commonwealth countries.
SUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the supply to the Services of aircraft,,
guided weapons (including ballistic missiles), nuclear weapons, and radar and other
electronic equipment. The individual Service departments are responsible for the
procurement of other weapons, stores and equipment, except that responsibility for
such stores and equipment when used by more than one Service normally rests with the
War Office, which in many cases is the largest user.
Production and Research
Production for the Services is carried out to a great extent by private industry
on a contract basis, but also by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards
and other establishments operated by the Ministry of Aviation, the Admiralty and the
War Office. The Ministry of Aviation’s research establishments carry out research and
development on behalf of the War Office and the Air Ministry, and also for certain
aspects of Admiralty requirements, in particular naval aviation. Among the most
important of these establishments are: the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough;
the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern; the National Gas Turbine Establishment,
Farnborough; the Guided Weapons Establishment (an outstation of the Royal Aircraft
Establishment) at Aberporth, Cardiganshire; the Rocket Propulsion Establishment,
Westcott, Buckinghamshire; and the Aircraft and Armament Experimental Establish¬
ment, Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. War Office controlled research establishments
DEFENCE
US
include the Armament Research and Development Establishment, Sevenoaks, Kent;
and the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, Chobham,
Surrey. The Admiralty research establishments (see p. 118), carry out research on
ships, maritime equipment and weapons and also on certain kinds of electronic
equipment on behalf of all three Services. Current production and development
programmes are summarised later in this chapter in the sections dealing with the three
Services individually.
Development and production of nuclear warheads to meet Service requirements
are carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority (see pp. 212-3) under contract from
the Ministry of Aviation, which is responsible for the completed weapons. The Atomic
Energy Authority is also co-operating with the Admiralty in research on the develop¬
ment of nuclear propulsion.
Service officers attend courses at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment,
Harwell, and have also been attached to industrial firms manufacturing guided weapons
during the development stage.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Aviation’s research establishments,
and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in Australia under the
Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project. Service firing trials of
air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at Aberporth and at the Army
gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing surface-to-surface missiles has been
•set up on South Uist in the Hebrides. There is close collaboration with the United States
in the exchange of information and visits by technical personnel.
Some military equipment, including guided weapons, aircraft and radar equipment,
is being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual Security Programme.
Part of this equipment is manufactured in the United Kingdom and financed by the
United States under the ‘off-shore procurement’ programme. Under this programme
the United Kingdom is also making equipment for other NATO countries in Europe.
Wherever possible, weapons and other military equipment are standardised with NATO
allies. The United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, are
co-operating in the development of tanks, light tracked vehicles and anti-tank weapons.
In addition to any orders for warships that may be placed from abroad with British
yards, ships of the Royal Navy which have become surplus to United Kingdom
requirements are made available to the Governments of other Commonwealth countries
and to those of other friendly nations.
Nuclear Weapons
During the second world war, British research workers played an essential part
in the allied project that led to the production of the first atomic bombs in the United
States. After the war, the exchange of information on atomic weapons was for a time
prohibited by an Act1 of the United States Congress (later amended), and the United
Kingdom therefore developed its own independently. The first test explosion of a
British atomic weapon was carried out in 1952 in the Monte Bello Islands, off the north¬
west coast of Australia; further tests took place a year later near the Woomera rocket
range, in central Australia, and early in 1954 it was announced that delivery of atomic
weapons to the armed forces had begun. Further series of tests were held in 1956 and
1 The Atomic Energy Act, 1946 (known as the McMahon Act), subsequently replaced by the
Atomic Energy Act, 1954. Substantial relaxations were made by amending legislation passed in
1958, which permits, inter alia, the exchange, with friendly nations, of both nuclear and non¬
nuclear parts for weapons and military reactors and of information on nuclear weapon
development.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1957, in the Monte Bello Islands and at the weapons proving ground at Maralinga,
in the South Australian desert. Britain now has a substantial and growing stockpile
of kiloton1 weapons.
In February 1955, the Government announced its intention to proceed with the
development and production of thermonuclear weapons. The first test explosions
were successfully carried out in May and June 1957 near Christmas Island in the
central Pacific, and further tests were carried out in the same area later in 1957 and
in 1958. The production of British megaton2 weapons is now proceeding steadily.
The 1958 tests and the exchange of information with the United States3 have enabled
important technical advances to be made in the design of nuclear warheads which will
permit a significant increase in the rate of production.
The chief means of delivering these weapons are at present the RAF’s medium
bombers of the V-class. The development is proceeding of Blue Steel propelled stand-off
bombs which will greatly reduce the vulnerability of a bomber aircraft by enabling
it to release its bombs a long distance from the target, outside the range of the missile
defence system. In February 1958, the United Kingdom and United States Govern¬
ments signed an agreement for the provision of launching sites in the United Kingdom
for United States Thor intermediate-range ballistic missiles; these weapons, which
became operational in 1959, would be used with nuclear warheads in time of war only
with the agreement of both Governments. The possibilities of mobile launchers
(aircraft or submarines) for long-range delivery of nuclear warheads are being investi¬
gated. The United Kingdom and United States Governments agreed in June i960,
that if the United States missile Sky bolt (designed for launching from an aircraft) is
successfully developed, and can be fitted to Mark 2 V-bombers, the United Kingdom
will place an order with the United States for a number of the missiles (for which the
United Kingdom will provide the nuclear war head) and their associated equipment.
Research is in progress into defensive measures against ballistic missiles and, under an
agreement between the United Kingdom and United States Governments signed in
February i960, a joint Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station is being built at
Fylingdales Moor in Yorkshire. The United States is providing the equipment for
the station.
THE FIGHTING SERVICES
THE ROYAL NAVY
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty, which has three civilian
and six naval members. The First Lord of the Admiralty is the minister responsible
to Parliament for the Navy. The other civilian members of the Board of Admiralty
are the Civil Lord, who is a minister, and the Permanent Secretary, who is a civil
servant and responsible for the general conduct of Admiralty business, including finance.
The naval members are the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff; the Second Sea
Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy,
whose responsibilities include ship construction and repair, research and the provision
1 A kiloton weapon is equivalent to one thousand tons or more of high explosive.
2 A weapon is said to be in the megaton range if it is equivalent to 500,000 tons or more of
high explosive.
3 An Anglo-American agreement, signed in July 1958, made possible the exchange of informa¬
tion on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This agreement was amended and
supplemented by a further agreement, signed in May 1959, which contained provisions to enable
the United Kingdom to buy from the United States component parts of atomic weapons and
weapons systems, other than actual warheads, and to make possible the exchange of nuclear
materials between the two countries.

and repair of naval aircraft; the Fourth Sea Lord and Vice-Controller, responsible
for supplies and transport, maintenance and dockyard organisation; the Vice-Chief
of Naval Staff, who assists the First Sea Lord; and the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff
and Fifth Sea Lord, responsible for stating requirements for ships, aircraft and
weapons and for laying down Admiralty policy on aircraft research and development.
The Shape of the Fleet
The new defence plans, announced in 1957, envisage a Navy that is smaller than
in the past but highly mobile. The aircraft carrier will continue to be the core of the new
Navy. Grouped round the carriers will be supporting ships carrying the latest weapons
for dealing with air, surface and underwater attacks and capable of acting by themselves
on detached service. Apart from carriers, the number of large ships will be restricted
to the minimum. Many ships in reserve, including battleships, are being disposed of.
During i960 there were 147 ships in the operational Fleet, and a further 42 ships
engaged on trials or training. Five carriers, 2 of the 5 cruisers, 22 of the 34 frigates
and 37 minesweepers in the operational Fleet had come into service since 1950. In
addition, among ships on trials and training or in operational reserve, 2 carriers, 140
minesweepers, 30 coastal craft and 12 destroyers or frigates were also completed during
1950-60.
The modern carriers have, or are being equipped with, the angled flight deck, the
steam catapult, the automatic aircraft positioning device, and the mirror and ‘Audio’
landing aids (all British inventions), and the most advanced type of air warning and
direction system. A new carrier, Hermes, equipped to carry the latest aircraft now in
production for the Fleet Air Arm (see p. 118), joined the Fleet in i960. The recon¬
structed Victorious joined the Fleet in 1958. The former aircraft carrier Bulwark has
been converted into a commando carrier and joined the Fleet in this role in January
i960. Bulwark is designed to carry a Royal Marine Commando (some 600 men),
together with helicopters, landing craft and vehicles.
The first of the three ‘ Tiger’ class cruisers, with fully automatic armament and
the latest control equipment, was commissioned in March 1959. The first guided
missile ship was launched in i960, and the construction of the three others on order is
well advanced. Trials of the Seaslug missile, with which these ships will be equipped,
have shown this to be a most effective weapon for the interception of attacking aircraft
and a production order has been placed for this weapon. The guided missile destroyers,
in common with the majority of other ships, will also carry the shorter-range guided
missile Seacat for close air defence.
In the five-year period from the beginning of 1956 to the end of i960, 24 new
anti-submarine frigates, 8 new anti-aircraft frigates and 13 new submarines will have
joined the Fleet; in the same period, 3 anti-submarine frigates and 14 submarines will
have been modernised. Five of the fast long-range submarines of the ‘Porpoise’
class had been commissioned by the spring of i960, and by the end of i960, 8 of
this class are expected to be in service.
One of the main purposes of the Reserve Fleet is to have ready, at short notice,
ships to replace those in the Active Fleet which are damaged or withdrawn for refit
or modernisation. Under the new defence policy the Reserve Fleet is to be smaller
than in the past, but is being maintained at a higher state of readiness.
Afloat support to the Fleet for replenishment at sea, or in harbours or anchorages,
is provided by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service, comprising tankers, store-issuing
ships, tugs and salvage vessels. These ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned by
Merchant Navy officers and seamen.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Research and Development
Much experimental work has been carried out, with the Atomic Energy Authority,
on Dreadnought, the Navy’s first nuclear-propelled submarine, which was launched in
i960. Dreadnought incorporates a United States nuclear propulsion unit. An order for
the first all-British nuclear submarine is expected to be placed during 1960-61.
Fundamental investigations are also in hand for the development of counter-measures
against submarines with increased underwater speed. Research is proceeding with the
aim of providing automatic means for handling tactical information in warships.
Research and development work to meet the Navy’s modern requirements for
weapons is now concentrated in two establishments. At Portsdown (near Portsmouth),
the design and development of ship-borne gunnery and guided missile systems is
carried out. At Portland (Dorset), all aspects of work on underwater detection are
co-ordinated with work on underwater weapons.
The close relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of
America is being continued, as well as collaboration with other members of the
Commonwealth. Several valuable items of new equipment have been brought into
service through the United States Mutual Weapons Development Programme and
certain naval projects are being discussed with countries of the Western European Union.
Commands and Naval Dockyards
The Navy’s main home commands are Portsmouth, Plymouth, The Nore, Scotland
(Rosyth) and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. As one of the steps to be taken
to ensure that available resources are used to the best advantage, it was announced in
February 1958 that the Nore Command (based on Chatham) would be abolished and
its functions transferred to other commands by April 1961. A major reorganisation
of the Navy’s dispositions overseas was also announced in the same month. In the
North Atlantic and Mediterranean area, where command arrangements are integrated
with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, United Kingdom naval forces are to be
equipped predominantly for an anti-submarine role, and will consist of two aircraft
carriers (with a third in reserve), two cruisers and a number of destroyers, frigates and
submarines. In the Far East, the fleet (based on Singapore) will be an all-purpose force
of one aircraft carrier, one commando carrier and one cruiser, together with destroyers,
frigates and smaller vessels. Small naval forces continue to operate under the
Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic and South America Station, who, when not
afloat, flies his flag near Cape Town (by agreement with the South African Government);
the Senior Naval Officer, West Indies Station, who flies his pennant afloat; and the
Commodore, Arabian Seas and Persian Gulf, who is also Naval Deputy to the
Commander, British Forces, Arabian Peninsula.
Naval shore support at home and overseas is also being reorganised in line with the
changes in the operational fleet. The reductions include the closing of H.M. Dockyards
at Hong Kong, Malta,1 Sheerness and Portland and of five air stations in the United
Kingdom. At home, the dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth
will continue to provide the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities. Singapore
and Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas.
Fleet Air Arm
The Hawker Sea Hawk and the de Havilland Sea Venom provide the main day and
all-weather fighter strengths of the Fleet Air Arm, but they are being succeeded

respectively by the Supermarine Scimitar, which can carry an atomic bomb and
which is fitted, owing to its high speed, with a ‘flap-blowing’ system to facilitate
landing on carriers, and the de Havilland Sea Vixen, with armament which includes
an air-to-air guided weapon, the Firestreak. The first front line squadron to be equipped
with Scimitars embarked in the carrier Victorious in 1958 and the equipping of other
squadrons with this aircraft is proceeding. The first squadron of Sea Vixens was
commissioned in July 1959. A new strike aircraft to replace the Wyvern, the Blackburn
NA.39, is on order; it has a greater range and speed and is able to carry an atomic bomb.
The anti-submarine turbo-prop Fairey Gannet has been in service since 1954
and has now been replaced in that role by helicopters; Gannets are still used in the
search role. British-built helicopters, the Whirlwind and the Dragonfly, are in service
with the Fleet Air Arm. A more powerful all-weather helicopter, the Wessex, has
been ordered as a replacement for the Whirlwind and will become the Navy’s main
anti-submarine aircraft.
Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of men trained for service on sea or land.
Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of the corps are:
(1) to provide personnel for Commandos;
(2) to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties required
for amphibious assault; and
(3) to supply detachments for H.M. ships, which {a) play their part in the routine
duties of their ship, (6) provide emergency landing parties, and (c) carry out
guard duties and the like.
Women’s Royal Naval Service
The Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) is an integral part of the Navy. Its
members serve both at home and overseas. It has its own disciplinary code. Nursing
services for the Navy are provided by Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service
(QARNNS).
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Navy
The main entry for naval officers is the Cadet Entry. Cadetships on the General
List (Seaman, Engineer, Electrical and Supply) are available to young men between
the ages of approximately 17 and 19 years. A number of scholarships are awarded
to boys between the ages of 15 and 17; these give help with school fees for the two
years before a boy goes to Dartmouth. Those selected enter Britannia Royal Naval
College, Dartmouth, in September each year. Here they spend a year doing Basic
Naval Training, ashore and afloat, followed by a year as midshipmen at sea in the Fleet.
The Seamen and Supply Officers then return for a further year at Dartmouth for
academic training, followed by specialist courses and a further year at sea. The Engineer
and Electrical Officers study for a degree, for which specially selected officers will go to
Cambridge, the others reading for an external London degree at the Royal Naval
Engineering College, Manadon.
Short service commissions on the Supplementary List for Seaman duties, for air¬
crew duties with the Fleet Air Arm or in electrical specialisation are available to young
men with appropriate qualifications. Doctors, dental surgeons and instructor officers
all enter on short service commissions after completing their professional training, and
permanent commissions are awarded to them according to the vacancies available.
E

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ratings may qualify for a commission on the General List, on the Supplementary
List for Seaman and aircrew duties, and on the Special Duties List.
Commissions in the Royal Marines are gained through examination and successful
candidates are given a special training, part naval and part military, which lasts three
and a half years.
The age limits for entry as a rating in the Navy are as follows: seaman, engineering
mechanic, electrical mechanic and naval air mechanic branches, 15 to 28 years,
communications, naval airman and supply and secretariat branches, 164 to 28, artificer
apprentices, 15 to 17I; sick berth branch, 17! to 28; artificers (trained), 19I to 28 years.
The initial engagement is for a period of 9 years over the age of 18, plus a period of
three years in the Royal Fleet Reserve. Exceptionally, for artificer apprentices it is
12 years over the age of 18. Age limits for entry into the ranks of the Royal Marines are:
marines, 17 to 28 years; junior entry (general service duties), 16 to 17; boy buglers,
15 to i6£; junior musicians, 14 to 17^; musicians (trained), 17^ to 28 years. Women
may enter the Women’s Royal Naval Service between the ages of 17^ and 28 years
for an initial period of 4 years; most WRNS officers are selected from serving ratings.
On entry, all naval and WRNS ratings and Royal Marines other ranks are given
a basic training at the appropriate school or shore establishment and are given ‘refresher’
courses at regular intervals during their time in the Service.
Reserve and Auxiliary Forces
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) consists of volunteer reserves—serving at sea
in the Merchant Navy or the fishing fleets or in civilian employment ashore—who
carry out training in time of peace to meet the Navy’s mobilisation requirements.
Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve (RFR), composed of men who have
completed their service as regulars; the Royal Naval Special Reserve (RNSR), which
includes most of the National Service men who are discharging their liability for part-
time service; the Royal Marine Forces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR); and the Women's
Royal Naval Reserve (WRNR).
Royal Naval Minewatching Service
The Minewatching Service, a civilian organisation composed of men and women
volunteers, is responsible in time of war for manning posts around the coast and
overlooking the main navigable waterways. Its object would be to spot mines dropped
from aircraft, and to plot and report their positions.
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps, which is administered by the Navy League in conjunction with
the Admiralty, is the oldest pre-Service movement for boys in Britain; its origin dates
from the time of the Crimean War in the mid-nineteenth century. Its aim is to give
technical training to, and instil naval tradition in, boys under the age of 18 who intend
to serve in the Royal and Merchant Navies and also to those sea-minded boys who
do not intend to follow a sea career but will, given this knowledge, form a valuable
reserve for the Navy. It also aims to provide for the social and educational welfare
of the cadets and to develop character and good citizenship.
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary
of State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the Parlia¬
mentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the War Office
DEFENCE
121
(who is a minister and vice-president of the Council), and the Permanent Under¬
secretary of State for War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The
Service members of the Army Council are the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,
who is assisted by the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff, responsible for strategic
policy and plans, operations and intelligence, and the Deputy Chief of the Imperial
General Staff, responsible for war organisation, equipment, weapons and training; the
Adjutant-General to the Forces, responsible for manpower, personnel, discipline,
medical services, welfare, education, and the women’s services; the Quartermaster-
General to the Forces, responsible for supplies, transport and, jointly with the
Permanent Under-Secretary, works services; and the Master-General of the Ordnance,
responsible for research into, and the design, development, production and procurement
of, Army stores.
Organisation of the Active Army
The active Army is organised in 30 arms and services,1 which include the Household
Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry
Regiments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Corps
of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land and wireless
communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade of Guards), the regi¬
ments of the Infantry of the Line (grouped into brigades and the Parachute Regiment),
the Army Air Corps (which operates light aircraft on reconnaissance and undertakes
aerial observation and liaison work), the Royal Army Service Corps (responsible for
the provision of food and fuel supplies and transport vehicles), the Royal Army
Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for most equipment and
stores), and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
The Women’s Royal Army Corps (formerly ATS) and the Queen Alexandra’s
Royal Army Nursing Corps (formerly QAIMNS) are both corps of the Regular
Army, their officers and other ranks being subject to military law and the Queen’s
Regulations in the same way as members of the other corps.
Within the United Kingdom, the Army is organised into Scottish, Northern,
Southern, Eastern, Western, and Northern Ireland Commands, and London District.
There are four main commands overseas: Middle East Land Forces, East Africa Com¬
mand, Far East Land Forces, and the British Army of the Rhine (which forms part of
Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces).
In July 1957, plans were announced for reducing the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal
Artillery, the Royal Engineers and the infantry by a total of 51 regiments or battalions.
Corresponding reductions are being made in supporting and administrative units.
Following extensive trials carried out in the British Army of the Rhine, Army
field formations are being reorganised on the basis of flexible, self-contained infantry
and armoured brigade groups, able to fight, to move and to maintain themselves under
minimum direction from headquarters.
As the strengths of overseas garrisons are reduced, increased importance is being
attached to a central strategic reserve, based mainly in the United Kingdom, which is
being reconstituted on a brigade group basis.
Equipment
By the end of the five-year programme initiated in 1957, the weapons of the second
world war will have almost completely disappeared and the Army will be completely
rearmed with a new range of weapons, vehicles and other equipment.
1 These arms and services include the women’s corps.
122
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Increasing emphasis is being placed in current plans on transportability by air, in
order to secure strategic mobility. Certain bulky items of equipment, such as heavy
tanks, cannot be transported by air but, apart from these items, air portability is a
major feature of the Army’s new equipment. Equipment transportable by air in service
or being planned includes the Mobat anti-tank gun and light vehicles for the infantry,
the Ferret scout car and the Saladin armoured car in service with the Royal Armoured
Corps, and an advanced guided missile anti-tank system and the Thunderbird surface-
to-air anti-aircraft guided weapon for the Royal Artillery. A production order has been
placed for an air-portable howitzer of Italian design.
For tactical mobility within a theatre of operations, new engineer equipment for
rapid construction and repair and new bridging equipment are on order. I o assist
in achieving mobility on the battlefield itself, the Centurion tank is being equipped with
more powerful armament, pending the entry into service of its successor, now under
development; radio communications in the field are being greatly improved with new
equipment which includes the Manpack portable set, a radio relay set, and a new set
for armoured vehicles; a self-propelled gun of increased range and performance and
an improved type of armoured personnel carrier are being designed; and the Skeeter
helicopter is coming into service as a reconnaissance aircraft. Two types of light
liaison aircraft, the Canadian Beaver and the P.531 helicopter, are on order. The Army
has been almost completely re-equipped with the British version of the FN self-loading
rifle, a weapon of Belgian origin adopted by the United Kingdom in the interests of
standardisation with other NATO forces, and troop trials are taking place with the
FN general purpose machine gun.
Progress is being made in the introduction of surface-to-surface guided weapons,
the first of which are being supplied by the United States. The first guided weapon
course was started at the Royal Military College of Science in Berkshire as early as
1950. In 1955, groups of Army instructors began to receive training in the United
States in the use of the Corporal guided missile; training in Britain is now given at
the School of Artillery at Larkhill. Two artillery regiments have been equipped with
the Corporal, and one of the regiments has joined the British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR); the other unit will also join BAOR on completion of its training. A further
artillery regiment is being equipped with the United States Honest John missile.
Two heavy anti-aircraft regiments are being equipped with the Thunderbird surface-
to-air missile. The Australian Malkara air-portable anti-tank guided weapon is on
order. Short-range nuclear weapons are also being developed for the Army.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Army
The normal method of entry for a regular commission in the Army is through the
Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst (Camberley, Surrey), where selected cadets
undergo a course lasting two years before receiving their commissions. This course
gives a general military and academic background for all arms and services, and
young officers on leaving Sandhurst then attend special arm courses to prepare them
for their own arm, some attending technical courses at the Royal Military College of
Science (Shrivenham, Berkshire) and at Cambridge University. Cadets may enter
Sandhurst direct from school or after they have enlisted in the Army or been called
up for National Service. Up to 40 scholarships are awarded each year on the results
of a competitive examination held twice a year. University graduates may be accepted
for direct regular commissions without previous service in the ranks.
The War Office also maintains a boarding school, Welbeck College, at Worksop,
Nottinghamshire, where 150 boys are educated for two years between the ages of 16
DEFENCE
123
and 18 years. These boys pass into the Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Army Ordnance
Corps or the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. A few may be commissioned
into the Royal Engineers.
A small number of schoolboys are selected to take engineering or science degrees
at the Royal Military College of Science as National Service officers and thereafter
to be granted regular commissions. Regular commissions may also be granted to other
officers already serving on National Service commissions or on short service commis¬
sions. Candidates for National Service and short service commissions are trained at
the Officer Cadet School, Mons Barracks, Aldershot. At this school the course, which
consists of purely military training, lasts for four months. Young men suitable for short
service commissions are now sent direct to the Officer Cadet School instead of, as
hitherto, having to serve for a period in the ranks.
Men wishing to enlist in the ranks must be British subjects between the ages of
17^ and 30 years, of good character, medically fit and able to pass an intelligence
test. Those with certain trade qualifications may be accepted up to the age of 33 years.
Men can sign on for 22 years (with the option of finishing their Colour Service at the
end of six years or at the end of any consecutive period of three years thereafter,
provided they give six months’ notice in writing). Recruits may choose the corps in
which they wish to serve and their wishes regarding trade training are met as far as
possible.
On entry into the Army, other ranks are trained at the depots or with the training
units of the arms or services for which they have been selected. This initial training
consists of six weeks’ basic military training common to all arms and services, and a
further period of training which is special to the arm or service concerned. This latter
training varies in length of time, e.g., infantry, four weeks; Royal Signals electronic
technician, 22 weeks.
A boy can enlist in the Army as an apprentice tradesman, between the ages of 15
and 17; a junior leader, between the ages of 15 and i6|; and a drummer band boy,
piper or tailor, between the ages of 15 and 17! years.
After the age of 18 years, Army apprentice tradesmen serve nine years with the
Colours and three years in the Reserve. Boys enlisted for training with junior leader
units may serve either for nine years with the Colours and three years in the Reserve,
or six years with the Colours and six years in the Reserve. The object of the junior
leaders’ units is to produce long-term regular warrant officers and senior non-commis¬
sioned officers, and that of the apprentice schools is to produce warrant officer and
non-commissioned officer tradesmen for the Regular Army, some of whom may become
specialist commissioned officers.
Women may enlist into the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps or
into the Women’s Royal Army Corps between the ages of and 33 years.
The Reserve Army
With a smaller Regular Army, the Reserve Army, consisting of the Army Emergency
Reserve and the Territorial Army, will have an increasingly important part to play.
The Territorial Army consists of volunteer officers and other ranks (including women),
National Service officers and men carrying out their statutory obligation of three and a
half years’ part-time service after completing their whole-time service with the Army,
and the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers. With the end of National Service it will
become a wholly volunteer force. Its main role in the event of war would be the defence
of the United Kingdom, but some units might be needed overseas and all its members
are liable for service in any part of the world when the army reserve is called out by
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
124
proclamation. Volunteers are required to attend annual camp and to carry out a mini¬
mum number of training periods. Selected units undergo civil defence training each
year and attend a civil defence camp once every four years. While the military authorities
are responsible for policy, training and discipline, local administration of the Territorial
Army is carried out largely by county territorial and auxiliary forces associations.
The Army Emergency Reserve has as its main function to provide essential com¬
munications and the technical and administrative services required on mobilisation by
both the Regular and the Territorial Armies. It consists of specialist units and pools
of skilled men—both volunteers and part-time National Service men—who can be
called upon at short notice to fill gaps in regular units.
Cadet Forces
The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and the Army Cadet Force (ACF) provide training
on Service lines for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The CCF provides
training in schools in which education is continued to the age of 17 years or above.
Cadets receive a general basic training and then specialised training in the Royal Navy,
Army or Royal Air Force sections. Contingents are affiliated to regular units and
establishments of the Services. The ACF is recruited from schools which do not raise
contingents of the CCF, and from boys who have left school. Like all the pre-Service
organisations, these forces provide citizenship and character training as well as specific¬
ally military training. There is a training centre for the CCF and ACF at Frimley
Park, Surrey.
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council, composed of the Secretary
of State for Air, who is president, and seven other members. The Parliamentary
Under-Secretary for Air is vice-president and the Permanent Under-Secretary of
State for Air, who is a civil servant, is secretary of the Council. The Service members
are the Chief of the Air Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and the fighting
efficiency of the RAF; the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for inter-Service
policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with other air forces, standardisation and ground
defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for the preparedness for war
of the RAF, for command, staff and air training, and for policy regarding future
aircraft and weapons; the Air Member for Personnel; and the Air Member for Supply
and Organisation.
Commands
The Royal Air Force is organised into commands administered by the Air Council:
At Home: Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical
Training, Maintenance and Signals Commands.
Overseas: The Middle East Air Force (headquarters in Cyprus), the Far East
Air Force (headquarters at Changi, Singapore), Royal Air Force,
Germany (Second Tactical Air Force, stationed in Germany as part of
Britain’s contribution to the NATO forces), British Forces, Arabian
Peninsula (headquarters in Aden), and Royal Air Force, Malta.
Aircraft and Equipment
The spearhead of the RAF is the force of four-engined jet bombers, which is
building up steadily. At first, the majority of squadrons were equipped with Valiants,
but the proportion of Vulcans and Victors, with greater performance, is rising rapidly.
DEFENCE
125
Stocks of nuclear weapons are increasing, together with Bomber Command’s ability
to carry them. Improved marks of the V-bombers, now on order, will carry the Blue
Steel propelled stand-off bomb and will be capable of being refuelled in flight, giving
them an increased range. The V-bombers will form for many years the foundation of
Britain’s deterrent power, though ballistic missiles will gradually play an increasing part.
In addition to their strategic role, the V-bombers provide reconnaissance aircraft
of great range and accuracy. The present reconnaissance force is composed mainly of
Valiants, but these are being replaced by Mark 2 Victors.
The tactical bomber force in Bomber Command is at present equipped with Canberra
twin-engined jet bombers, but will later be re-equipped with Valiants. This force is
committed to NATO. A tactical strike reconnaissance aircraft of great versatility, the
TSR.2, is being developed for Army support and other tactical operations.
Surface-to-air guided weapons are being introduced, but manned fighters will
continue to be needed to deal with manned aircraft, the stand-off bomber and radar¬
jamming aircraft, to prevent reconnaissance and to investigate unidentified movements.
Fighter Command is equipped with Hunter day fighter and Javelin all-weather fighter
aircraft. The Lightning, the RAF’s first supersonic fighter, entered squadron service in
i960. The aircraft is fitted with an electronic computer to aid bomber interception and
is equipped for flight-refuelling to augment Fighter Command’s capacity for overseas
reinforcement.
Air defences are being recast in order to concentrate on the defence of nuclear
bases. In 1957, an organisation was set up in the Air Ministry to co-ordinate and speed
up the introduction of defensive guided missiles and their associated radar, and to
integrate them with the existing control and reporting and fighter defence systems.
The system of control and reporting, which has been built into a highly efficient
organisation, is closely linked with the radar systems of Continental allies. Great
advances in the development of radar have been made in recent years. A reconstructed
radar chain now covers the whole of the United Kingdom. The high performance of
the latest system makes it possible to have greatly improved cover with a smaller
number of stations. The Royal Air Force will command and operate the joint UK—US
Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station being constructed in Yorkshire (see p. 116).
Full-scale service trials of the RAF’s first air-to-air guided missile, Fireflash, began
in 1957 with Swift aircraft, for experimental work and training purposes. A more
advanced missile, the Firestreak (also in service with the Fleet Air Arm), is fitted to
Mark 7 and 8 Javelins now in service, and will be an integral part of the Lightning
weapon system until replaced by a guided weapon of even greater performance.
The development of surface-to-air guided weapons is well advanced. The first
RAF missile station, at North Coates, Lincolnshire, was brought into use for service
trials and training in May i95^- surface-to-air missile of the semi-active homing
type known as Bloodhound is now being delivered to the RAF. More advanced types
are being developed.
Coastal Command’s long-range maritime reconnaissance force, which is committed
to NATO, is wholly equipped with Shackleton aircraft. An improved version—the
Shackleton Mark 3—is now in service, and earlier marks are being progressively
modernised to an equivalent standard.
Transport Command is being re-equipped to provide increased mobility for the
strategic reserves of both land and air forces. A Comet 2 squadron was formed in
!956—the first all-jet transport squadron in any air force—and has proved very
successful. Two squadrons of Britannia aircraft are in service for long-range transport;
for short and medium ranges, use will still be made of piston-engined Hastings.
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Beverley freighter, now in service, is a versatile aircraft which can lift large loads.
A small number of Britannic 3 freighter aircraft are on order to supply the need for a
strategic freighter able to carry large military loads quickly over long distances. An
order has also been placed for a military version of the Armstrong Whitworth Argosy,
which will be used as a tactical freighter for dropping parachutists as well as for normal
movement of troops and stores. Twin Pioneer short-range aircraft are now in service.
A contract has been placed for the vertical take-off aircraft, the Rotodyne.
Increasing use is being made of helicopters for operations and for the Search and
Rescue Organisation of Coastal Command, which in peace time also operates for the
rescue of civilians involved in shipping accidents or other difficulties in coastal waters.
The Sycamore and Whirlwind helicopters have given good service, particularly in
Malaya, and the Bristol Belvedere twin-engined helicopter is on order.
Basic flying training schools are being re-equipped with the Jet Provost trainer
and an order has been placed for a training version of the Lightning-, the Gnat trainer
is being developed for advanced jet training. The RAF was the first air force to adopt
all-jet training.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work of the Royal Air Force and of its reserve
and auxiliary formations. The WRAF is an integral part of the Royal Air Force and its
members train with and work alongside airmen in the same trades, serving both in
the United Kingdom and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Princess Mary's
Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Recruitment and Training for the Regular Air Force
Pilots, navigators and air electronics officers are appointed to commissions in the
General Duties Branch, the flying and executive branch of the RAF. They enter either
on the General List, with an assurance of a pensionable career to the age of 55, or on
the Supplementary (Flying) List. Appointment to commissions on the General List
may be obtained through a cadetship at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire
(pilots and navigators only), by entry as a university graduate, or under a special agree¬
ment for other well-qualified entrants. The majority, however, are appointed to the
Supplementary (Flying) List, either to short service commissions or to permanent
commissions which offer a pensionable career initially to about the age of 38, but with
opportunities of serving to the age of 55 either on the General List or on the Supple¬
mentary (Flying) List. Except for those entering through Cranwell, where the course
lasts three years, flying training takes about 18 months for pilots and one year for
navigators and air electronics officers.
Officers in ground branches are usually found from people in civil life, some of
whom already hold professional qualifications, who enter the Royal Air Force on short
service or permanent commissions. Short service officers may be selected for permanent
commissions while in the Royal Air Force.
Permanent commissions may also be obtained through cadetships at the Royal Air
Force Technical College, Henlow, Bedfordshire (Technical Branch),.the RAF College,
Cranwell (Secretarial and Equipment Branches), or the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst (RAF Regiment). University graduates are also eligible for permanent com¬
missions under special conditions. Some technical cadets proceed after one year at
Henlow to a three-year degree course at a university.
Applicants for enlistment for service as airmen or airwomen must be British
subjects of good character and medically fit. Men between the ages of 17^ and 39
DEFENCE
I27
years may be enlisted as trained tradesmen if they can pass the appropriate trade test,
or otherwise for training in any RAF trade for which they may be suitable, subject to
vacancies. Enlistment is for one of specified periods within a maximum of 12 years.
Subject to requirements, airmen may re-engage to serve to the age of 55 with the option
of discharge after completing 22 years’ reckonable service for pension. A recruit training
course of 8 weeks is followed by trade training where necessary and posting for duty.
Boys may enlist between the ages of 15 and 17 as apprentice advanced tradesmen
or between the ages of 15^ and 16^ as boy entrants for training in skilled trades.
Apprentices enlist for 12 years from the age of 18 and boy entrants for 12 years or
9 years plus 3 years’ reserve service from the age of 18.
Women between the ages of 17 and 39 may enlist for normal service as airwomen
for periods of 3, 4, 5 or 6 years. Subject to requirements, they may subsequently
extend their engagements to a maximum of 12 years, or re-engage to serve to the age
of 55 with the option of discharge after 22 years’ service reckonable for pension. Women
between the ages of 17 and 52 may enlist for local service as airwomen for 2 years,
which may be extended by one or two years at a time. Women of at least i8| years of
age and of the requisite educational standard may be selected for short service
commissions. Opportunities exist for both short service officers and airwomen to
gain permanent commissions.
Auxiliary and Reserve Forces
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of fighter control units and maritime head¬
quarters units (the latter controlled by Coastal Command) raised and maintained
by Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists mainly of officers and men who have served
in the Air Force. The Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which is part of the Royal
Air Force Reserve, provides a pool of officers, airmen and airwomen who, like the
personnel of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, train on a part-time basis. It includes
members of the university air squadrons.
Part-time National Service men serve in Class H of the Royal Air Force Reserve or
they may volunteer to join the Volunteer Reserve or the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.
Royal Observer Corps
The Royal Observer Corps, a predominantly civilian and voluntary organisation,
now administered by Fighter Command, originated during the first world war and was
officially established in 1925. Its present strength is over 15,000 men and women, who
have the specialised tasks of identifying and reporting the movements of aircraft,
and of measuring and reporting on radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack. By
1961, 1,500 underground operation centres will have been built for the corps; the
first was opened in August 1959.
Air Training Corps
The Air Training Corps provides pre-Service training for boys between the ages of
14 and 18 years. Like the other pre-Service formations, it seeks to inculcate good
citizenship as well as training for the RAF.
HOME DEFENCE
The second world war showed the importance of having trained and organised
bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy air attacks on the
civil population; and the Civil Defence Act, 1948, recognised that a permanent system
128
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of civil defence was essential to national safety. The development of nuclear weapons,
while it has greatly intensified the problems of civil defence and has called for much
replanning which is still in progress, has not lessened the need for an efficient civil
defence organisation. Civil Defence, in the words of the 1958 White Paper on Defence,
‘remains an integral part of the defence plan’.
In the event of nuclear attack, the problems of rescue, fire-fighting and welfare
operations would be greatly intensified by the presence of radioactivity, which would
have to be detected and its extent and intensity measured. The first call would have
to be met by the civilian services on the spot, and these would be supported by the
armed forces in the country at the time, whether regular or reserve, which were
not immediately required for combat operations. The Minister of Defence is charged
with planning the part which the armed forces would play in home defence, and with
co-ordinating the plans of the military authorities with those of the civil authorities.
The country’s economic capacity limits the effort which can be devoted to home
defence preparations; and the main defence objective must be to maintain the nuclear
deterrent—not to prepare for war but to prevent it. In home defence the main task in
peace time is to keep a local organisation in being as a framework for expansion if
necessary, to provide training equipment and to proceed with essential research. The
Government has declared its conviction that, if the deterrent were to fail, countless
lives could be saved by civil defence preparations made in advance.
Organisation of Civil Defence
Civil defence planning in the United Kingdom is the responsibility of a number of
ministers each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. As the development of effective civil
defence services involves much detailed planning at local level, the central Government
has enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry and commerce
and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organisations such as the
Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Voluntary Services.
In addition to his direct responsibilities under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the
Home Secretary is responsible for co-ordinating the defence plans of all the civil
agencies of the Government. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for
civil defence matters in Scotland.
In England and Wales, the Home Secretary supervises the civil defence activities
of the police and fire services, and he administers the Civil Defence Corps and the
Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as shelter policy and the national
air attack and fall-out warning and monitoring systems. The Civil Defence Depart¬
ment of the Home Office is under the charge of a Director-General of Civil Defence,
appointed by the Home Secretary. Other Government departments have direct
responsibility for the civil defence applications of the services which they control;
for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital and first-aid services,
and the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland, the Scottish Home Department deals with questions corresponding to
those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales, and the Department of
Health for Scotland is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid services.
In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, places
responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs, which may
arrange for other departments to undertake some functions on its behalf.
The co-ordination of civil defence planning in Great Britain necessarily involves
much work by interdepartmental committees, on which all departments with civil
DEFENCE
129
defence responsibilities are represented, in order that plans and programmes may be
constantly reviewed to take account of changes in the scale and nature of possible attacks.
England is divided into ten civil defence regions in charge of Regional Directors
of Civil Defence, appointed by the Home Office, and there is also a Director of Civil
Defence for Wales. Their duties include liaison with the armed forces and the planning
of combined exercises. There is no corresponding regional organisation in Scotland,
where planning is carried out centrally, although the country is divided into three
zones for operational purposes.
The Civil Defence Services
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks, the following
services, in which in times of peace only part-time service is required, are raised in
Great Britain1 by voluntary recruitment of civilians, both men and women:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which was established in May 1949, to assist local
and other authorities to carry out their civil defence functions.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, to reinforce the fire services maintained by local
authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947. (The Fire Service would become
a national organisation in time of war.)
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries to reinforce the National
Hospital Service in England and Wales. In Scotland, there is also an Ambulance
Section of the Reserve to provide the additional manpower for the war-time
operation of the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed forces,
recruits for all services are drawn from men and women who are willing to serve
and who will undertake to train regularly. The Government does not pay the volunteers
for their services but reasonable out-of-pocket expenses are reimbursed.
Strengths in Great Britain on 31st March, i960, were:
Civil Defence Corps .. .. .. .. .. .. 359,959
Industrial Civil Defence Service (on 31st October, 1959) .. 192,588
Auxiliary Fire Service .. .. .. .. .. .. 19,584
N ational Hospital Service Reserve .. .. .. .. 66,092
The Civil Defence Corps. This Corps is recruited and organised by certain local
authorities (mainly the councils of counties and county boroughs in England and
Wales, or counties and large burghs in Scotland) in local divisions. The local divisions
are subdivided into five sections2 as follows:
Headquarters: control of civil defence operations, communications, recon¬
naissance (including the identification of toxic agents).
1 In Northern Ireland there are three main services: the Civil Defence Corps, the Auxiliary
Fire and Rescue Service, and the Hospital Service Reserve.
2 Four in Scotland, where there is no separate Ambulance and Casualty Collecting section,
ambulance services being provided by the National Hospital Service Reserve, and casualty
collecting being a warden duty. In Northern Ireland, the Civil Defence Corps, which is organised
directly by the Ministry of Home Affairs and not by the local authorities, consists of three sections
only—^Headquarters, Wardens and Welfare; the Ambulance Service forms part of the Hospital
Service, and the Rescue Section has been integrated with the Auxiliary Fire Service to form the
Auxiliary Fire and Rescue Service.

The Industrial Civil Defence Service. The Government has invited the managements
of the larger industrial and commercial undertakings to form civil defence units for
the protection of their own personnel and to assist the public civil defence services.
The Government’s aim is to have an efficient civil defence unit in all premises where
more than 200 people work. Units formed under these arrangements comprise
headquarters, warden, rescue, first aid and fire guard sections. These units train in
much the same way as the Civil Defence Corps, and in war would operate in close
association with it and with the other public civil defence services.
The Auxiliary Fire Service. Fire authorities (see p. 77) are required to enrol
auxiliary firemen as members of fire brigades for service which is restricted, except
in a war emergency, to such duties as are desirable for training. This organisation is
known as the Auxiliary Fire Service, but the personnel are members of the individual
brigades in which they are enrolled.
Training
Members of the Civil Defence Corps are required to undertake the training necessary
to enable them to carry out the duties of an ordinary member of the section of the
Corps to which they belong, and thereafter to undertake a few hours’ refresher
training, including exercises, each year. If they wish to increase their knowledge they
may undertake courses of additional and advanced training.
Civil defence instructors are trained either at one of the three Home Office Civil
Defence Schools or locally, under arrangements made by local authorities, in accordance
with directions given by the Home Office or the Scottish Home Department. Courses
and studies for senior officials concerned with civil defence are held at the Civil Defence
Staff College at Sunningdale, Berkshire, and in Scotland, at the Home Office Civil
Defence School at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire.
Auxiliary firemen are trained by officers and men of the regular brigades, who
themselves receive special training in emergency fire-fighting at the Home Office
Fire Service Training Centre at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. They are
encouraged to gain practical experience of fire-fighting by performing stand-by duty
at fire stations to enable them to respond, with regular members of the brigade, to
calls to fires. Exercises are also held, involving the control and operation of large
numbers of pumping and other fire-fighting appliances.
The Police
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the maintenance
of law and order and the control of traffic, and they would also be responsible for
certain additional war-time and civil defence tasks. In all these duties they would
have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
DEFENCE
I3I
Role of the Armed Forces
The Services have a vital role to play in civil defence; all armed forces, whether
regular or reserve, in the country at the outbreak of war who are not engaged in
active operations against the enemy will have to be prepared to assist in the struggle
for survival. The armed forces are in no sense a substitute for civil administration;
the aim will be to support the civil authorities by all possible means. All units of the
Regular and Reserve Armies are trained in peace time for the civil defence tasks they
may be expected to perform in war. In addition, between 1955 and 1958, some 25,000
men of the Royal Air Force were trained in emergency fire-fighting operations at
Home Office training centres to enable them to serve as firemen in a National Fire
Service.
There is close liaison in peace time between the civil and military authorities at
all levels. Joint exercises are continually being held and everything possible is being
done to align the civil and military chains of command. As a result, the functions
which the military authorities could undertake in support of the civil authorities have
been more clearly defined: there is also a growing understanding among the civil
authorities of the part that the military authorities can best play.
There are two main ways in which the fighting Services can render assistance:
by helping the civil authorities to maintain control; and by the direct employment
of units on various tasks such as aid to the police in the maintenance of law and order
and traffic control, aid to the fire service, assistance in the reception and care of the
homeless, in the treatment and evacuation of casualties and in the clearance of radio¬
active fall-out zones, the provision of guards, the maintenance of road, rail and water
communications, light rescue, reconnaissance and the provision and running of camps.
V. SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local government
authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy, education and
health services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the care of aged or
handicapped persons, the care of children, the nutrition of mothers and children,
and sickness, maternity and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement pensions
and family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are spending over
£3-7 million a year on social services; that is £72 a )^ear a head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and social
and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made them¬
selves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the homeless
and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole community
had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the facilities they
provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The State now
supplements these voluntary services and provides financial assistance, sees that
essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures that the
necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services surround and supplement the State services. The
two types are complementary, not competitive, and they merge into each other.
State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
individual or special needs. The officers of central and local government, in carrying
out their duties, co-operate with the workers of many voluntary social service societies,
while the institutional provision made by the State and by local authorities for the
care of the chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types for the care of the sick and elderly, most of whom receive State pensions
or benefits.
Voluntary Organisations
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands, which range from national organisations to small individual local groups.
Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented on
local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly concerned
to give personal service, others are mainly interested in the formation of public opinion,
and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and misfortunes
include the societies represented on the National Council of Associated Children’s
Homes, the National Marriage Guidance Council, and the voluntary family casework
agencies, of which the Family Welfare Association, working mainly in London, is the
best known.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British Red
Cross and the St. John Ambulance Brigade, but a number of societies exist to help
sufferers from particular disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
132
SOCIAL WELFARE
I33
the National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health, and
the constituent members of the Central Council for the Care of Cripples.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, the Committee on Social Service
of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society, the Church of
England Moral Welfare Council, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young
Women’s Christian Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the
Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the
Jewish Board of Guardians.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Voluntary
Service, which ‘lends a hand’ in every kind of practical difficulty, brings, ‘meals on
wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, minds children, and visits the sick in
hospital, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
A central link between different voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned
with social welfare is provided by the National Council of Social Service, which brings
together most of the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action,
either as a whole or in groups of organisations concerned with particular aspects, such
as youth work and old people’s welfare, in England and Wales, the Scottish Council
of Social Service and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service. It was the
National Council of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of
which there are now about 430 in the United Kingdom. The role of the bureaux is to
give explanation and advice to the citizen in doubt about his rights or who does not
know about the State or voluntary service which could help him.
Social Workers
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part in
probably every service, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their
operation chiefly on the professional social worker, that is, the full-time salaried
worker trained in the principles and technique of social work. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate course
in social science followed by a specialised training for a particular service. The latter
is sometimes organised by the profession concerned. An attempt is being made
to lessen specialisation in social work. A working party on social workers in local
authority health and welfare services, which reported in May 1959, recommended
the establishment of a national council for social work training and a new general
training in social work, to be available outside the universities, leading to a national
qualification. The courses of professional training provided in the universities and
one or two other courses of comparable standard would continue to afford the
highest qualifications.
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training of social
workers, but Government departments and local authorities now employ a considerable
number of trained social workers, for example, in child care, youth work, almoning,
psychiatric social work, and the probation service.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AND RELATED SERVICES
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and National
Assistance together constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need anyone fall below a certain
minimum standard of living.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
134
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the first three of
these measures in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are administered by the
Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. National Assistance is administered by
the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in Northern Ireland by the
National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance throughout the
United Kingdom.
Appeals relating to claims for insurance benefits, family allowances or war pensions,
or applications for assistance, are not decided by the ministry or the board but by
independent authorities appointed under the Acts.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain can be
traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be regarded as its
starting point in England and Wales), the modern system of comprehensive provision
is a creation of the twentieth century. Non-contributory old age pensions were intro¬
duced in 1908, and the first contributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans
in 1926. A contributory National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and
in the same year a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920
was extended to cover the great majority of employed persons. By the beginning of
the second world war the social services in Britain were among the best in the world,
but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their piecemeal development, and
not everyone came within their scope.
Under the stimulus of war, when plans for post-war reconstruction were being
formulated, Lord (then Sir William) Beveridge was invited by the National Coalition
Government to investigate the country’s existing social insurance system. In 1942
the Beveridge Report was published; it recommended the creation of a compre¬
hensive and unified system of social insurance. The report aroused intense interest
and was accepted in general by the Government as the basis on which the future
social security structure should be built.
In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts introduced the new comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July, 1948. Adjustments have been made
by a number of subsequent Acts.
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable income
on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income tax
reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of
dependants.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single
system. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man as well as Great Britain are party to
most of the agreements with other countries. Reciprocal agreements on national
insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances are in operation with Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Jersey. Agreements with Malta, France, Israel,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia cover
national insurance and industrial injuries insurance. With Australia and New Zealand
there are agreements on national insurance and family allowances. There is an agree¬
ment with Guernsey on family allowances only, with Cyprus on national insurance,
and an agreement with the Irish Republic which covers national insurance and contains
SOCIAL WELFARE
*3$
some industrial injuries provisions in relation to seafarers. Other agreements are
under negotiation.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
Family allowances have been provided by the State since August 1946, under the
Family Allowances Act of June 1945. Nearly 5! million allowances are being paid
in Great Britain to just under 3^ million families with two or more children. An
allowance is paid for each child other than the first or only child below the age limits.
The age limits are 15 years for children who leave school at that age, 16 years for certain
handicapped children, and 18 for children who remain at school or are apprentices..
The rate of the allowance is 8s. a week for the second child below the age limits and
1 os. a week for the third and each subsequent child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit the
family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to the mother
or to the father. There is no insurance qualification, and parents who are not British
subjects may claim allowances if they satisfy a special residence qualification.
The corresponding scheme in Northern Ireland makes similar provision for-
family allowances.
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July, 1948.
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949 and 1951, the Family
Allowances and National Insurance Acts, 1952 and 1956, and the National Insurance
Acts, 1953-59. The Acts apply, in general, to everyone over school-leaving age living
in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1—Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract
of service or are paid apprentices—about 24 million.
Class 2—Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—nearly i| million.
Class 3—Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in class 1 or 2
—about half a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and cannot
be insured in their own right unless they were insured under the old scheme on the
5th July, 1948, and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons, or
unless they have since taken up paid work. Employed married women may choose
whether to pay separate contributions themselves or to rely on the cover provided
by their husbands’ contributions, which make them eligible for maternity and home
confinement grants, retirement pension at lower rate, widow’s benefit and death
grant. Students receiving full-time education and unpaid apprentices need not pay
contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions are credited to them. Over that age
they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed persons (class 3) and thus safeguard their
title to widow’s benefit and to retirement pension at full rate. Self-employed and non-
employed persons whose income is not more than £156 a year can apply to be exceptedt
from liability to pay contributions.

Contribution s
The main weekly rates of contribution in April i960 are shown in Table 7. A
change in the rates for certain employed persons aged 18 and over is planned to take
effect from April 1961 (see p. 137).

(a) Boys and girls under 18 years of age contribute at lower rates.
{b) Including, for class i, the industrial injuries insurance contribution of 8d. from employee
and gd. from employer for a man, and sd. from employee and 6d. from employer for a
woman.
The Exchequer supplements these contributions from general taxation. They
are normally paid on a single contribution card by national insurance stamps bought
from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that
the class 1 contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee’s share from his
or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards.
Contributions are usually ‘credited’ for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury, or
if widow’s benefit is being paid.
An insured person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions when
he retires, or is deemed to have retired, from regular employment after reaching
minimum pension age (65 for men, 60 for women). If such a person does any work as
an employed person thereafter, he must pay an industrial injuries contribution; his
employer’s liability remains the same as shown in Table 7.
Benefits
The scheme provides payments to contributors during unemployment (if normally
working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an employer or self-
employed), confinement and the weeks immediately before and after (for women
normally working for an employer or self-employed and paying national insurance
contributions at the full rate), and to widows in the first 13 weeks after bereavement
and subsequently while they have young children or if they have reached the age of 50
when widowed or when their children have grown up; two kinds of allowances in
SOCIAL WELFARE
I37
respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is not payable; and pensions for
people who have reached 65 (60 for women) and who, if under 70 (65 for women)
have retired from regular work. The scheme also provides cash grants for three expen¬
sive contingencies—the birth of a child, a confinement at home (or elsewhere otherwise
than at public expense), and for a death (though not for the death of someone already
over minimum pension age when the scheme started).
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before benefit
can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been paid
since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless a
specified number of contributions have been paid or ‘credited’ over a specified period.
There are special rules to help a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s
pension at widowhood or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness
or unemployment benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established
herself in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to
help divorced women who were not paying contributions during their marriage.
Amounts
The majority of benefits have been paid, since the scheme began, at one standard
weekly rate, now £2 10s. for men and women alike, which may be reduced if insufficient
contributions have been paid, but is not affected by other unearned income or the
previous level of earnings. Earnings made while the benefit is in payment, however,
may cause its reduction or withdrawal; unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a
person earning more than a specified amount from a secondary occupation; widows,
and retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for women), have their pensions
reduced in step with earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though
not affected by continued payment of wages, is terminated if the person receiving it does
more than a negligible amount of paid work. Exceptions to the standard weekly rate
are the higher rate of ^3 10s. payable to widows, without regard to any earnings, during
the first 13 weeks after bereavement, the increased retirement pension payable to some¬
one who has continued at work beyond minimum pension age, and the lower rate of
£1 14s. unemployment or sickness benefit payable to a married woman who is not
separated from her husband and unsupported by him or else maintaining an invalid
husband, i.e. who is the second not the first breadwinner in the household. The
standard rate of retirement pension for a woman on her husband’s insurance is £1 10s.
a week. Standard increases are payable for dependants at the rate of £1 10s. for an
adult (generally a wife), 15s. for the first or only child under the family allowances
age limits and 7s., over and above any family allowances payable, for other children.
However, the amounts payable to widows for their children are larger: £1 for the first
or only child and 12s. for others.
A new system is to be introduced under the National Insurance Act, 1959, for
people working for an employer, by which the level of their earnings will affect the
rate of both their contributions while working and their retirement pension, though
not of other National Insurance payments. It will apply to all whose employers do
not contract out of the scheme on the grounds that comparable benefits are already
guaranteed, even if an employee changes his employment, under an occupational
scheme1. For all such employees in the national scheme there will be a new minimum
joint contribution of 15s. 4d. (men) or 13s. 6d. (women) instead of the present joint
1 Occupational pension schemes, organised by employers and outside the National Insurance
scheme, at present cover more than one-third of the working population, including half of
the men.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
138
contribution of 18s. 2d. or 14s. Qd. (as in Table 7), and a new graduated contribution
of 8^ per cent, divided equally between employer and employee, will be paid on
earnings above £9, running to a maximum of 10s. 2d. on earnings of £15 or more.
Each .£7 1 os. of graduated contributions paid by an employed man, with the matching
,£7 1 os. paid by his employer, will add sixpence a week to his standard pension of
j£2 i os. if he is single and £4 if he is married. For a woman, who becomes entitled
to her pension five years earlier, each sixpence will correspond to .£9 of graduated
contributions paid by her with the matching contributions from her employer.
The new system is to come into operation in April 1961.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of whom must
have been insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a guardian’s allowance of
,£1 7s. 6d. a week. It is paid to the person in whose family a child is, for the time being,
included. For certain orphan children a child’s special allowance is provided: it is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled, on the death of
her former husband, for any children of that marriage below the family allowance
age limits to whose support he has been contributing. The weekly rate of the allowance
depends on the amount he has been contributing, subject to a minimum of 5s. and a
maximum of ,£1 for the first or only child and 12s. for each other child.
The rates of grants are varied: £12 10s. maternity grant is payable for a confinement
and a further grant for each additional child born at the same confinement living 12
hours after its birth; £5 is paid for a confinement at home or elsewhere other than at
public expense; and £25 death grant on the death of an adult (less for a child, or for
an adult who was within 10 years of minimum pension age when the scheme started).
All these amounts have been increased since the scheme came into operation; the
figures given are those current in April i960.
Duration
In general, National Insurance allowances are paid for as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than a year
if less than 156 contributions have been paid (possible within three years for a contri¬
butor who was continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is payable in the first
instance for 30 weeks, after which it may be continued for up to 19 months in all,
according to the person’s record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit
drawn in recent years. Maternity allowance begins 11 weeks before the expected week
of confinement and ends after the sixth week following the expected week or the actual
confinement if this is later.
Similarly, widowed mother’s allowances at the full standard rate cease when the
children reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to receive
50s. for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter above the age limits
but under 18. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow, provided she is
over 50 (and had been married at least three years when her husband died), and the
similar pension normally paid to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her
widowed mother’s allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension
age and retired, or at most till age 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then becomes
entitled to a retirement pension.
NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the Work¬
men’s Compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s Compensation Act
of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by accidents arising out of, and
SOCIAL WELFARE
139
in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases due to the nature of employ¬
ment. It covers practically everyone in class 1 of the National Insurance scheme and
certain others. The relevant Acts are the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)
Acts, 1946 to 1959. Cover against industrial injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland
is provided to the same extent by the separate legislation of the Parliament of
Northern Ireland.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Injury benefit for an adult is ^4 5s. a week plus £1 10s. for an adult dependant
and 15s. for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits and 7s.
for each other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance payable. It is paid
when the insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or
prescribed disease, and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on
the date of the accident or development of the disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement benefit may be paid if, after the payment of injury benefit has ceased,
there remains some loss of physical or mental faculty as the result of the industrial
accident or prescribed disease. The amount depends on the extent of the disablement,
as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £4 5s. for 100 per cent disablement to
17s. a week for 20 per cent disablement. For disablement of less than 20 per cent a
gratuity is normally paid, ranging up to £280.
In the following circumstances disablement benefit may be increased:
1. It will be made up to the 100 per cent rate during in-patient treatment in a
hospital for the relevant injury or disease, and increases for dependants may
also be paid.
2. If benefit is being received at the 100 per cent rate and someone is needed to
look after the insured person, a constant attendance allowance not exceeding
£1 15s. a week (£3 10s. in cases of exceptionally severe disablement) may be
paid.
3. If the insured person is permanently unfit for work an unemployability
supplement of £2 10s. a week may be paid, with allowances for dependants.
4. If the insured person is unfit to return to his former job, or work of a similar
standard, benefit may be increased (subject to a maximum of £\ 5s.) by a
special hardship allowance of up to £1 14s. a week.
Death Benefit
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit may be
paid to the dependants.
For widows living with their husbands at the time of death, a pension of £2 10s. a
week is payable for the first thirteen weeks of widowhood. Thereafter, if the widow
(1) is entitled to a child’s allowance or was over the age of 40 on ceasing to be so
entitled, or (2) was over 50 years of age, or was permanently incapable of self-support,
at the time of her husband’s death, or (3) is not entitled to child’s allowance, but has
residing with her a young person under the age of 18 who was or could be treated as
being in her late husband’s family, or (4) is over 40 years of age when (3) ceases to
apply, or (5) is pregnant by her late husband, she is entitled to a pension of £2 16s. a
week. If none of these conditions is satisfied, the widow may receive a pension of
a week.
140
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances age
limits. For widows, these allowances are normally at the rate of £1 a week for the
first or only child and 12s. a week for each other child. For other beneficiaries, the
rate is 15s. and ys. a week respectively.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be entitled to
pensions, allowances or gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the
relationship and the extent to which the dependants were maintained by the deceased
during his lifetime.
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND WELFARE SERVICES
The National Assistance Act, 1948, which came into operation on 5th July, 1948,
inaugurated a single comprehensive State service of financial assistance for those in
need, whether because their resources, including social security benefits, were not
enough to meet their particular requirements, or because they fell outside the scope
of other social services. It also gave authority for other kinds of social welfare services
besides financial assistance.
The National Assistance Board is responsible for administering cash assistance,
in the form of weekly grants. It has various other duties, including the administration
of non-contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936 (still payable on a
nationality, means and residence test to a diminishing number of persons aged
70 years or over and to blind persons aged 40 years or over who do not receive National
Insurance pensions); the administration of hostels provided under the Polish Resettle¬
ment Act, 1947; and the determination (under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949,
and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act, 1949) whether a person’s resources
bring him within the Legal Aid Scheme and, if so, what, if anything, is the maximum
amount he may be called upon to pay towards the cost of his case.1 It is also responsible
for influencing ‘persons without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life,
and provides temporary accommodation for them in reception centres, usually
through the agency of local authorities. For men who have become demoralised by
long unemployment and who are in receipt of national assistance grants or are using
reception centres, it runs two re-establishment centres where they are given courses
designed to help them get back into work.
The provision under the National Assistance Act of residential accommodation
for the aged, infirm and others, of temporary shelter for people who lose their homes,
and of special welfare services for the blind, the deaf, the crippled and other handi¬
capped people is the responsibility not of the National Assistance Board but of county,
county borough, and a few district councils in England and Wales and, in Scotland, of
councils of counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland, financial assistance to a person in need is given under the
provisions of the National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, and there is
also a system of non-contributory pensions similar to that operating in Great Britain.
Under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, local authorities, in their
capacity as welfare authorities, provide residential accommodation for the aged,
infirm and others in need of care and attention. The welfare authorities also provide
special services for the blind, deaf and other handicapped people.
Welfare Services for the Blind and the Disabled
All local welfare authorities provide services for the blind, either directly or through
voluntary organisations acting as their agents. Most authorities are providing, or are

arranging for, welfare services for the deaf and other handicapped people; voluntary
organisations also play an important part in this work by supplementing local
authority services.
Services for the blind include a home visiting and teaching service, employing
qualified home teachers, to assist the blind to adjust themselves to their blindness
(special attention is given to the newly blind and to those with more than one disability,
such as the deaf-blind); instruction in craft work and in the use of embossed letters
for reading and writing; social clubs, holiday and other recreational facilities; the
supply or loan of apparatus, such as wireless sets, embossed and recorded books,
adapted tools and games; residential social rehabilitation and placement in employ¬
ment; and an advisory service on the special financial and other benefits available to
the blind (including preventive and medical treatment, special education, and training
for employment). Voluntary organisations for blind welfare include local blind
societies and also national bodies, notably the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
the National Library for the Blind, St. Dunstan’s (for those blinded in the wars),
the Scottish National Federation for the Welfare of the Blind and the Scottish National
Institution for the War Blinded.
W elfare services for the blind are well established and progress is being made with
similar services for other severely and permanently disabled people. The teaching of
handicrafts, training for employment either in open industry or sheltered workshops,
the organisation of social centres, clubs and other social activities, the adaptation of
premises to meet individual disabilities, and the arrangement of holidays, are some of
the services most generally provided. Local authorities are required to keep registers
of the blind in their areas and of other local physically handicapped people who wish
to register.
Old People’s Welfare
The newer homes provided by local authorities for aged and other infirm persons
usually have accommodation for 25 to 40 residents; over 1,100 have been opened in
Great Britain since the end of the second world war. County welfare authorities in
Northern Ireland have provided 27 similar homes. These smaller homes are gradually
replacing the larger institutions which were previously maintained by local authorities.
There are also about 1,900 small homes for old and disabled people run by voluntary
bodies or by private individuals. Most of the voluntary homes have been established
since the second world war, usually with the assistance of grants from public funds.
A number of home services for old people are provided by statutory and voluntary
bodies to help them to go on living in their own homes for as long as possible. Local
health authorities supply, under the National Health Service, home nursing and
domestic help (see p. 72); over half the district nurses’ time is spent on the aged or
the chronic sick and the same group makes the heaviest demands on the home
help service.
Local authorities are enabled by the National Assistance Act to contribute to the
funds of voluntary organisations ‘whose activities consist in or include the provision
of recreation or meals for old people’. Some 7,000 social clubs for elderly people have
been started by voluntary effort in recent years in all parts of Britain. Other voluntary
welfare services for old people include ‘meals-on-wheels’ (cooked meals delivered to
their homes), the organisation of regular friendly visiting, holidays, chiropody services,
and laundry services.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees have been formed and are aided by the
National Old People’s Welfare Council, an associated group of the National Council
142

of Social Service widely representative of voluntary and statutory bodies having direct
contact with old people, or by the Scottish Old People’s Welfare Committee, a com¬
mittee of the Scottish Council of Social Service. A National Corporation for the Care
of Old People was established in 1947 by the Nuffield Foundation1 to stimulate and
to give financial support to schemes for the welfare of the aged, to maintain an expert
technical advisory service, and to encourage and undertake research and experiment
for the welfare of old people. It is now concentrating its main effort on home services.
The King George VI Foundation, financed from the fund raised in memory of the
late King, has spent nearly £600,000 on schemes for old people, by way of grants for
the development of existing clubs, the establishment of new clubs, and the training
of workers to help old people.
CARE OF CHILDREN DEPRIVED OF NORMAL HOME LIFE
The Children Act, 1948, which came into force with the ending of the Poor Law,
places upon local authorities in Great Britain a duty to receive into their care any
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been abandoned
or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or permanently. Local
authorities must keep a child in care until he is 18 years of age or until he no longer
requires it. Under the Children and Young Persons Acts, 1933-52, as regards England
and Wales, and under the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Acts, 1937 and
1956, local authorities are required also to accept children committed to their care,
until the age of 18, by juvenile courts, as needing care or protection. Both categories of
children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and to afford them
opportunity for the proper development of their characters and interests.
Children in care are, if possible, boarded out with foster parents, who receive an
allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home cannot be found, a child
may be placed in a children’s home managed by a local authority or a voluntary organisa¬
tion. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on housing estates
or in ordinary streets, where a group of twelve or fewer children live in the care of a
housemother or houseparents, the husband following his normal employment. Other
children may be placed in hostels or lodgings or in other accommodation specially
suited to their needs. The desirability of returning a child to his family circle as soon
as possible is fully appreciated, and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family
where this is necessary.
To carry out their functions under the Children Act, each local authority (county
council and county borough council or, in Scotland, council of a large burgh) is
required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s officer to be responsible
for the care and upbringing of children in the authority’s care. Children’s officers are
assisted by a staff of child care officers who undertake inquiries and who supervise
children placed in foster homes. Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding
the boarding out of children by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the
conduct of children’s homes have been made by the Home Secretary. The Secretary
of State for Scotland is the responsible minister in Scotland. The cost of

health and the prevention and relief of sickness; the advancement of social well-being; the
care and comfort of the aged poor; the advancement of education; and such other charitable
purposes as might be declared by Lord Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his
death. Prominent among the foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical, scientific
and social research and the development of medical services and of technical and commercial
education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million provided by Lord Nuffield and of gifts
and bequests from other persons.

the local authorities’ child care service, including the provision of training for
houseparents and child care officers, is shared between the local authorities and the
Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland, the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland)^
I95°) gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county borough (under the
general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the duty of caring for homeless
and neglected children. Legislation relating to children and arrangements for their
care follow the same general principles as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance (see p. 144).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue ta
play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as Dr. Barnardo’s, the
Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child Welfare Council, are
constituent societies of the National Council of Associated Children’s Homes, to.
which a large number of smaller voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland,
a valuable contribution is also made by the Children’s Homes and Hostels under the
auspices of the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other volun¬
tary organisations, including the Quarriers’ Home (formerly the Orphans’ Homes of
Scotland). Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations (of which there are
about 630 in Great Britain and 23 in Northern Ireland) are required to be registered
under the Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons
Act). The boarding out of children and all children’s homes in Great Britain, whether
local authority or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by Inspectors of the Home
Office Children’s Department, of the Scottish Home Department or of the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
The practice of adoption, for which legal provision was first made in England
and Wales in 1926 and in Scotland in 1930, has considerably increased during recent
years. Over 14,000 adoption orders are made annually in Great Britain; there are
always more would-be adopters than children available for adoption. Adoption is
now regulated by the Adoption Act, 1958, in Great Britain and by the Adoption of
Children Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, in Northern Ireland. The Registrars General
keep registers of adopted children; adoption societies (there are over 70 societies
which arrange adoptions) must be registered with the local authority (in Northern
Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
To safeguard the welfare of children living with their own parents or guardians,,
the children’s departments have a duty to cause inquiries to be made in any case
in which it is reported that a child may need care or protection, unless they are satisfied
that such inquiries are unnecessary. In addition, local authorities, at the request of
the Government departments concerned, have appointed local committees to
co-ordinate local authority and voluntary services dealing with unsatisfactory families;
one of their officers is designated as co-ordinating officer for the purpose of calling
meetings of interested bodies to discuss particular ‘problem families’ and to decide
on a course of action. These problem families, a very small minority in the community^
are the focus of much attention from health, housing, education, children’s and
welfare authorities and voluntary bodies. The voluntary Family Service Units under¬
take intensive and prolonged casework with such families and there are several volun¬
tary recuperative centres to which mothers, with their children, can be sent for a
period of residential training, sometimes as a condition of a probation order.
The old-established National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
and its Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors for the investigation of

cases of reported cruelty to, or neglect of, children in their own homes; when necessary
they resort to law for the protection of such children, but they prefer to achieve their
purpose by warning and advice.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments administered by the Ministry of Pensions and National
Insurance.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
£4 5s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of disablement.
The latter is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal healthy person
of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into account. Allowances
for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic pension and there are various
supplementary allowances, the main ones being for unemployability (£2 15s. a week),
constant attendance (up to £1 15s. and, exceptionally, £3 10s. a week), comforts
(10s. or £1 a week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to £1 14s. a week). There
is an allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a week) for persons drawing
disablement pensions who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40
per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are free of
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowance Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war orphans and to war widows. The standard rate of
pension for war widows of private soldiers is ^3 6s. a week, an addition being made
for higher rank, and they also receive allowances for their children (£1 5s. for each
child), and, in certain cases, an allowance for rent (up to £1 5s. a week). There is an
additional allowance of 10s. a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other relatives
who were dependent on a person whose death resulted from the wars may receive
pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans, and war pensioners have
priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of their war disabilities in
National Health Service hospitals.
Many voluntary associations, such as the British Legion and other ex-Service
organisations, give financial aid and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and
women and their families. The ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of the
years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half of the nine¬
teenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental or public health
services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal of refuse and cleaning of
streets, and the first half of the twentieth century for the development of publicly
provided personal health services, as distinct from environmental services, culminating
in the introduction in 1948 of a comprehensive National Health Service available to
every citizen. The scientific discoveries, especially of new drugs, and the improved
services of the last fifty years, including maternity and child welfare, school
health services and school meals, are reflected in declining mortality rates and
improved physique.
SOCIAL WELFARE
145
PUBLIC HEALTH
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and Wales. Local
authorities are mainly responsible for its implementation and they have extensive
powers for the making and administration of by-laws relating to matters of public
health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs, urban and rural district councils, and, to a limited extent, parish
councils. Local authorities also have power to secure clean air by establishing smoke
control areas (see p. 308).
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed on
much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on separate
Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various types of local
authority. The Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, and the Burgh Police (Scotland)
Act, 1892, constitute the basic legislation for Scotland. The local authorities concerned
are the councils of counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland, the councils of county
and non-county boroughs and urban and rural district councils are mainly responsible
for administering the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland), 1878-1955.
Control of Infectious Diseases
Local authorities are responsible to the Minister of Health (or the Welsh Board of
Health or the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Ministry of Health and Local
Government for Northern Ireland) for recording notifications of the prescribed
infectious diseases; they are also responsible for the investigation by the Medical
Officer of Health of outbreaks of infectious diseases, and for disinfection and other
measures advised by him for preventing the spread of infectious diseases in the area.
The same ministers have a general responsibility for supervising the operation of
health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of which is to prevent the
introduction of infectious disease into the country. This health control is undertaken
by health authorities using the services of medical officers, public health inspectors,
rodent inspectors and others.
Pure Food
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation now
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for Scotland
in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act, 1956, and for Northern Ireland in the Food
and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland), 1958. In England and Wales the Act and regulations
made under it are, in general, carried out and enforced by food and drugs authorities
(i.e. county councils, county borough councils and, generally, the larger borough and
urban district councils) in relation to composition, adulteration and description, and
by local authorities (i.e. county borough, borough, urban district and rural district
councils) in relation to purity and hygiene; the Ministry of Health and the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for advising
and for making regulations under the Act. Premises where food for sale for human
consumption is prepared, sold or stored are required to conform to certain hygienic
standards. Authorised officers of food and drugs authorities and of local authorities
are empowered to take samples of any food for sale for human consumption for
analysis or for bacteriological or other examination. Special regulations are in force
for certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
146
In Scotland, the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of counties,
and large burghs; the central department is the Department of Health for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, administration is in the hands of the county and county
borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry of Health
and Local Government.
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health Service Act,
1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act, 1947, and the Health Services Act
(Northern Ireland), 1948—came into force simultaneously on 5th July, 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act, 1946, is ‘to promote the establishment
in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improve¬
ment in the physical and mental health of the people of England and Wales and the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide or
secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amend¬
ment) Act, 1949, and the National Health Service Acts, 1951 and 1952, make some
modifications in the scheme for Great Britain and provide for charges to be made
for certain parts of the service, which is otherwise available free of charge to all accord¬
ing to medical need without regard to any insurance qualification, although all national
insurance contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national health contribution
under the National Health Service Contribution Acts, 1957-58.
Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has direct responsibility for (1) the
provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, including those for
mental disorder, (2) the conduct of research work into matters relating to the causation,
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or mental defect, (3) a public health
laboratory service, and (4) a blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsibility
for the general practitioner services and local health authority services. He is advised
by the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees on
various aspects of the service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through regional hospital
boards and hospital management committees or, in the case of teaching hospitals,
by boards of governors. The hospitals themselves have been grouped into admini¬
strative units; these consist sometimes of several formerly independent hospitals
and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400 such groups under the control of hospital
management committees, which are in turn under the control of 15 regional hospital
boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services can
conveniently be associated with a university having a school of medicine.
The members of the hospital management committees are appointed by the regional
hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the communities con¬
cerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but members of local
authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital boards are appointed
by the Minister of Health and are similarly constituted. The term of office is three
years, one-third of the board or committee retiring each year but being eligible for
reappointment. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are appointed by the
minister, a proportion of the members being nominated by the teaching faculty of the
university, the regional hospital board and the medical staff. All appointments to
hospital management committees, regional hospital boards and boards of governors
are honorary.
SOCIAL WELFARE
H7
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the minister; but it is
his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical students.
The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The administration of the general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and optical
services is in the hands of 138 executive councils, each covering the area of a county
or county borough. In a few cases, two areas are combined under one council. Each
council has an ophthalmic services committee responsible for administering the
supplementary ophthalmic service. Doctors, dentists and pharmacists are represented
on the executive councils and each profession also forms a local committee. Councils
of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local health authorities in charge of
local health services.
In Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authorities;
hospital and specialist services are administered by five regional hospital boards
appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 83 boards of management (the
equivalent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25 executive
councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities. The teaching
hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the regional hospital boards, but
special medical education committees consider matters relating to medical teaching.
The Scottish Health Services Council and its standing advisory committees advise
the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central Health Services
Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 155.
Health Service Finance
Annual expenditure on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
amounts to nearly 3J per cent of the total national income. The greater part of the
cost falls on the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation, and a small part is met
from local rates. Other income is derived from the national health contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution and from the payments for those parts of
the service for which charges are made.
To help to limit expenditure without reducing the services offered, it was found
necessary in 1951 and again in 1952 to introduce charges for certain items. There
is a charge of is. for each item entered on a prescription form, and charges are also
made for dentures and spectacles (except children’s spectacles in standard frames),
for elastic hosiery supplied in the family doctor service or hospital out-patients’
department, for certain appliances supplied to out-patients, for treatment in the
dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to persons aged
under 21 years or to nursing or expectant mothers), and for some local health authority
services. Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the
National Assistance Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946
Act, a limited number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing for
privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non¬
paying patients. Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds are fixed by statutory regulations.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private
patients’ accommodation on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and
treatment. Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment by a doctor
of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-time
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private

patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated mainly
by capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale
of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists dispensing
on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they dispense. Doctors
and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supplementary ophthalmic service are
paid prescribed fees for each sight test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are
paid according to the number of pairs supplied.
A committee set up to review the cost of the health service found no scope for
recommendations which would either produce new sources of income or reduce
substantially the annual cost of the service. It found that the real cost of the service,
after allowing for rising prices, had increased little during the years 1949-54, while
many of the services provided were substantially expanded and improved.1
The General Practitioner Services
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the service.
Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places they
practise in health centres established under the National Health Service Acts. About
25,000, or almost all, general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great
Britain take some part in the service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice have to apply
through their executive councils to the central Medical Practices Committee, so that a
better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated. The maximum
number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500;
the average number in England and Wales is about 2,200. It is normally through the
patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is obtained.
Of about 11,200 dentists in England and Wales available for general practice,
about 10,400 are in the service, and in Scotland 1,300 dentists (practically all those
in general practice) are in the general dental service.
Over 910 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 7,300 ophthalmic and dispensing
opticians in England and Wales, and 70 ophthalmic medical practitioners and 900
ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland, are engaged in the supplementary
ophthalmic service. This service provides for the testing of sight and provision of
spectacles. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Almost all chemists (nearly 16,000 in England and Wales and 2,800 in Scotland)
are taking part in the service.
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services include the provision of consultants; accommo¬
dation of all kinds including tuberculosis sanatoria, maternity departments, infectious
disease units, institutions and departments for mental disorder, convalescent homes,
and rehabilitation centres; and all forms of specialised treatment.
Hospitals
A large proportion of the 3,000 hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier

charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St. Bartholomew’s
Hospitals in London. One of the newest hospitals in use is the Princess Margaret
Hospital, Swindon, of which the first part was opened in i960; it embodies the latest
ideas in design and facilities. Restrictions on capital investment required by the
economic position just after the second world war and, after 1948, claims on the avail¬
able financial resources by other parts of the National Health Service, have meant
that a full-scale post-war hospital building programme was not launched until 1956.
Eleven new hospitals have now been completed in whole or in part, and a further 36
are at present under construction or planned, including two new dental hospitals,
and three ‘acute’ hospitals (not for patients with chronic diseases) to serve new towns,
as well as extensions and improvements to existing hospitals. It is intended to spend
nearly £35 million on hospital building in Great Britain in 1961-62.
About 2,640 of the hospitals in the National Health Service are in England and
Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually groups of hospitals
comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes, or treatment
centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals elsewhere in England and Wales (comprising
some 70 hospitals and other establishments). They have 475,000 staffed beds and a
nursing and midwifery staff of 150,600 full-time and 40,000 part-time nurses and
midwives. There are 402 hospitals in Scotland with 67,070 beds and 23,280 full-time
and 5,310 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons. Most
of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and French Hospitals,
serve a special group of patients; others are maintained for the chronic sick or for
convalescents by charitable organisations. There are also private nursing homes,
which must be registered.
Rehabilitation
The importance of rehabilitation as a facet of medical treatment is firmly established
and today hospital treatment is not limited to the relief of pain, or alleviation or cure
of pathological conditions, but aims at restoring the individual’s functional capacity
without delay. Special rehabilitation facilities are provided, for those requiring them,
in the departments of physical medicine and occupational therapy at the main hospitals,
and in a few special rehabilitation centres which are not attached to any hospital.
The work is carried out under the guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by
physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers,
working as a team. Experience has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces
the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity
for full work. The departments work in close association with the Disablement Resettle¬
ment Service of the Ministry of Labour. Rehabilitation methods have been applied
with advantage in the care of the chronic sick, the aged and the handicapped and
have enabled many patients to become self-sufficient or to be discharged from hospital
and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered by
the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service. Each region maintains
an organisation for collecting blood from voluntary donors in the region, who give
their blood without payment. The blood is kept in the regional blood bank, or issued
to area blood banks maintained at general hospitals in each region. There are two
central laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the
Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares grouping

serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and the Blood Products
Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma fractions. In Scotland the Blood
Transfusion Service is under the direction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Association, an independent voluntary body set up in 1940, which is supported partly
by voluntary contributions, but in the main by a grant from State funds, made by the
Department of Health for Scotland. A close liaison is maintained with the National
Blood Transfusion Service and the Blood Group Reference Laboratory of the Medical
Research Council.
Mass Miniature Radiography
Mass miniature radiography was introduced in 1943 as a means of early diagnosis
of tuberculosis. About 75 units in England and Wales and 10 in Scotland operate
under the regional hospital boards in close co-operation with the local health authorities.
They examine nearly four million persons a year, concentrating increasingly on areas
with a bad record for tuberculosis, on specially susceptible groups in the population,
and on adults in regular contact with organised groups of children.
Medical and Psychiatric Social Work
There are over 1,000 trained almoners working in Britain; the majority work in
hospitals, others in local authority services or elsewhere. The almoner co-operates
with the medical staff in the investigation and treatment of disease by elucidating
and adjusting social and economic factors which contribute to a patient’s disability
or impede his restoration to health. Psychiatric social workers are specially trained
for work in the mental health services and in child guidance clinics. They make an
invaluable contribution, not only to hospitals but also to the local health and education
services, in assessing the environmental factors in mental abnormalities and in helping
patients to make the necessary adjustments.
Bacteriological and Virological Laboratory Services
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct research and
assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic diseases. Its largest establish¬
ment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale in north-west London,
which includes the National Collection of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory,
and reference laboratories specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
There are also 8 regional laboratories at university centres and 51 area laboratories.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public health laboratory
service, bacteriological work is mainly done in hospital laboratories.
Mental Health Services
The treatment of mental disorder is regulated in England and Wales by the Mental
Health Act, 1959, and is to be regulated in Scotland by the Mental Health (Scotland)
Act, i960. Patients who are suffering from mental illness can consult the family
doctor and receive specialist advice at hospital out-patient clinics in the ordinary way.
If they need to enter a hospital for mental treatment, whether a general or a mental
hospital, they can do so without formalities. If patients, or their relatives, are unable
or unwilling to make the necessary arrangements for admission to a mental hospital,
it is the duty of a mental welfare officer of the local health authority to do so. Where
necessary in the interests of society or of the patients themselves, mentally disordered
patients can be compulsorily detained in hospital. There are procedural safeguards to
protect the patient from unnecessary detention and he, or his relatives, may appeal
SOCIAL WELFARE
I5I
against detention, in England and Wales to a mental health tribunal, and in Scotland
to the sheriff. The local health authority is expected to offer a welfare service to the
mentally ill, either before admission or to help their rehabilitation on discharge.
Local health authorities have a duty to provide services for mentally handicapped
people in the community, to visit them and to provide, where practicable, suitable
training or occupation. This is given in training centres where they attend daily, as at
school, or by home teaching. If necessary the local health authority can place the
mentally subnormal person under guardianship within the community or arrange
for his admission to a psychiatric hospital. In Scotland, education authorities share
the responsibility for providing training or occupation.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough councils
(in Scotland, county and large burgh councils) include those for maternity and child
welfare (but not hospitals and maternity homes), domiciliary midwifery, health visiting,
home nursing, the provision of domestic help (in such circumstances as sickness,
confinement or old age), the ambulance service (in Scotland the responsibility of the
Secretary of State, and in Northern Ireland of the Northern Ireland Hospitals
Authority), the prevention of illness and the care and after-care of the sick (including
the mentally ill and also the mentally defective), vaccination and immunisation, and the
establishment and maintenance of local health centres (in Scotland, the responsibility
of the Secretary of State).
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have existed for many years. They are part of
the advisory and preventive services of the local health authority; they offer regular
supervision by nurses and doctors to expectant and nursing mothers and young
children. Special sessions for test feeding and for remedial exercises are held at some
centres, and a feature of the service is the education of mothers by means of talks,
discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. Practically all centres are distribution
points for the national dried milk and vitamin preparations provided for expectant
mothers and young children (see below). About 75 per cent of all babies are taken
to the centres.
Maternal Care
According to the advice given by the doctor or midwife, or her own preference,
the expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital; in allocating
hospital beds, priority is given to those for whom domiciliary confinement is inadvisable
for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home conditions. The proportion
of confinements taking place in hospital varies considerably between different areas;
the national average has increased continuously over the past 25 years and, for England
and Wales, is now 64 per cent. The departmental committee which reported in
February 1959 on the maternity services in England and Wales recommended that
the hospital service should make provision for 70 per cent of all confinements, which
is the actual present proportion of hospital confinements in Scotland. Local needs will
continue to vary within this average.
For a home confinement, every mother can call upon the services of either a general
practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor if he is willing to undertake her
maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife in the domiciliary service of the
local health authority. The doctor carries out certain ante-natal and post-natal examina¬
tions, attends at the confinement if he thinks it necessary, and gives any other medical
F
!52
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
care required. The services of a consultant obstetrician are also available if the doctor
seeks his advice. Routine supervision and advice is given by the midwife, who visits
regularly before the confinement to examine, advise and help the mother. The expectant
mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction in preparation for mother¬
hood and in some cases for interim ante-natal supervision. The midwife delivers the
patient (unless the doctor considers it necessary to be present) and continues in atten¬
dance for the first 14 days after the birth. Midwives work in close touch with the welfare
centres in the care of the mother both before and after the birth of the child.
Welfare Foods Service
Local health authorities distribute the welfare foods, other than liquid milk, that
the Welfare Foods Service1 provides for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children at a low cost or free of charge. These foods are national dried milk as an
alternative to liquid milk2 and at an equivalent price; orange juice, at 5d. a six-fluid-
ounce bottle, for expectant mothers and children under two; cod liver oil, free of
charge, for expectant mothers and children under five; vitamin A and D tablets,
free of charge for expectant mothers as an alternative to cod liver oil, and also for
mothers for 30 weeks after confinement. Milk and orange juice are provided free of
charge if the families cannot afford to pay.
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some 450 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain provided
by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The National
Health Service Act, 1952, gave local authorities power to make charges for the use of
day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries (of which there are about 550 altogether)
must be registered with the local health authorities; this regulation applies also to
persons who mind for payment more than two children, not all of the same family.
Most local authorities contribute to the cost of the work done by voluntary denomina¬
tional and other bodies which care for unmarried mothers and their babies; a few
authorities make direct provision for their special needs through their health depart¬
ments. The voluntary associations for moral welfare employ specially trained workers
to help the unmarried mother in making plans for herself and her child. Most homes
and hostels for the ante-natal and post-natal care (and, in some cases, the confinement)
of these mothers are provided by such organisations.
Health Visiting
Health visitors are State Registered Nurses, with at least six months’ training in
midwifery, who have had special training in health visiting. They are employed by
local health authorities to visit people in their own homes to give advice on the care
of young children, expectant and nursing mothers, persons suffering from illness,
1 The service began as a war-time measure with the National Milk Scheme in 1940, but in
1946 the Government decided to continue the extended scheme as part of the peace-time social
services. Beneficiaries now obtain the necessary tokens from the Ministry of Pensions and
National Insurance.
2 The liquid milk allowance (which is obtained through the usual retail channels) is one
pint a day at 4d. a pint for expectant mothers, children under five years of age, and children
of five years or more but under sixteen years who are physically or mentally handicapped and
who are unable to attend school or a training centre (where they would receive milk).
SOCIAL WELFARE
I53
including mental illness, and any injury or disability requiring medical or dental
treatment, and on measures necessary to prevent the spread of infection. Their duties
include health education and attendance at ante-natal and child welfare clinics. They
may also undertake tuberculosis visiting and school nursing.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses to attend patients who require nursing in their own
homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many authorities
employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have arranged for voluntary district
nursing associations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities (welfare authorities in Northern Ireland) have the power
to make arrangements for domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) in households
where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or the presence of children, old people
or mental defectives. This service is mainly used in the care of old people, in maternity
cases and, to a lesser extent but increasingly, for families where such help is needed
to prevent children having to be cared for away from home, for example, during
the absence of the mother. Home help is not one of the free services, and authorities
are authorised to recover from those assisted such charges as the authorities consider
reasonable, having regard to the person’s means.
Ambulance Services
Ambulances are provided free by local health authorities either directly or, on their
behalf, by voluntary organisations, in the case of any accident or sudden illness in the
street or a public place; also, if authorised by a hospital or a doctor, for the conveyance
of patients between home and hospital or clinic. The Hospital Car Service (organised
by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the Women’s
Voluntary Services) augments the ambulance service in many areas for the conveyance
of sitting patients. In Scotland, ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance
Service (St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish branch of the British
Red Cross Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland, they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
Prevention of Illness: Care and After-Care
Measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, e.g., the tracing of sources of infection,
the prevention of its spread, and the removal of the cause of infection, are the responsi¬
bility of all local health authorities. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment are the
responsibility of the hospital service and are provided through sanatoria and chest
clinics. The chest physicians staffing these clinics are often employed jointly by the
hospital authorities and local health authorities, to ensure that diagnosis and treatment
are properly co-ordinated with prevention and after-care. Among the duties of these
officers are those of making recommendations for residential treatment, visiting the
homes of patients, and examining and advising ‘contacts’. They are assisted in this
work by tuberculosis health visitors and nurses and, in most areas in England and
Wales, by almoners or other chest clinic social workers. Most local health authorities
have statutory or voluntary tuberculosis care committees. BCG vaccination is also
carried out on all suitable children of 13 and upwards, including students at universities
and colleges, and on various other persons specially exposed to risk.
Care and after-care of patients is supplemented by general advice and assistance
to the households in which they live. Local health authorities send suitable patients
J54
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to the village settlements for tuberculous persons which are run by voluntary bodies
or by local health authorities of other areas; training for employment is carried out
in conjunction with the training and resettlement schemes of the Ministry of Labour.
Care and after-care arrangements are made by all local health authorities for other
types of illness, including mental illness or mental subnormality, to varying extents;
in particular, there are a number of different services for people being nursed at home,
such as the loan of special equipment or the laundering of bed linen. A chiropody
sendee is provided in some areas. As part of their preventive work, local health
authorities can take preventive and remedial measures to safeguard the physical and
mental health of children in disintegrating families and give help and advice
to the parents.
A charge may be made for some of these services, if the person wishing to make
use of them can reasonably be expected to contribute towards their cost.
Vaccination and Immunisation
Arrangements for vaccination against smallpox and immunisation against diphtheria,
without charge, as part of the National Health Service, are made by all local health
authorities; in addition, most local health authorities have similar arrangements for
immunisation against whooping cough, and some provide for immunisation against
tetanus. In 1959 there was only one death from diphtheria in Great Britain, against
3,158 in 1941.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis is available also without charge to all persons
up to the age of 40 years as well as to certain others. BCG vaccination against tuber¬
culosis is available to certain adults and children (see p. 153).
Health Centres
A few health centres have been established to provide facilities for several services
under one roof; they differ widely in size and character according to local need.
Experience shows that they are likely to be most successful in areas of housing develop¬
ment where new services are needed. The need to observe the working of the experi¬
mental centres already set up and to conserve scarce resources is likely to prevent any
general expansion of the service in the near future. In Scotland, the provision of health
centres is not the responsibility of local health authorities but of the Secretary of State
for Scotland.
Problems of the National Health Service
The National Health Service is not without its difficulties and shortcomings. For
example, the original ideal of a comprehensive free service for all has to some extent
been breached by the introduction of charges for some parts of the Service which the
majority of the users have to pay. Nonetheless, the total cost of the Service continues
to rise, largely because of increases in prices and in staff salaries, the high cost of many
new drugs and of modern equipment, and the increased use made by the public of
the services provided. Moreover, shortages of staff, including dentists, midwives, and
nurses, give some anxiety. There is also some disparity between different parts of the
country: some have more family doctors than others, more hospital beds for confine¬
ments of mothers who would prefer to have their babies in hospital though they do
not need specialist medical care, and more extensive local authority services by way of
home helps and night attendance to enable infirm old people and the chronic sick to
remain in their homes.
On the credit side of the balance may be set the steady improvement in the country’s
vital statistics to which the National Health Service has largely contributed, the decrease
SOCIAL WELFARE
I55
in invalidity from neglected ailments, and the removal of anxiety about the cost of
treatment from which many of those who now use the service previously suffered.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland, the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom, and the health
services established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, corre¬
spond fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National Health
Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range of services
shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England, Wales and Scotland.
The services in Northern Ireland are financed as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite so imme¬
diate or direct as in Great Britain: hospital property, for example, is vested not in the
Minister of Health and Local Government but in the Northern Ireland Hospitals
Authority. The Hospitals Authority has under its control 68 hospitals and three
special care institutions containing in all about 16,000 beds.
Vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Northern Ireland but otherwise
the range of preventive and domiciliary services is similar to that existing in Great
Britain. Domestic help (whole-time or part-time) for aged or handicapped persons
and expectant mothers is provided by county welfare authorities under the Welfare
Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949.
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive welfare services for sick and
handicapped persons in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision made
by central and local authorities. Some convalescent homes, for instance, of a type
outside the scope of the hospital service, are administered by such bodies. In many
areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes are visited and
helped by voluntary organisations. Though the need for material aid from private
sources becomes less as public provision extends, many forms of help to meet individual
needs that would not otherwise be met are given by voluntary agencies. Their most
valuable service is probably to pioneer in aspects of personal service as yet not touched
by the public services. These voluntary agencies are able to make use of many part-
time or full-time unpaid volunteers.
A great deal of voluntary help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. More than half the hospitals in England and Wales have their
own Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who organise and
undertake a variety of sendees for their hospitals. Many hospitals also have help from
the British Red Cross Society, the Order of St. John, the Women’s Voluntary Services,
or a similar organisation. The operation of canteens for out-patients, and trolley-
shops and book and picture library services for in-patients, visiting in the wards,
receiving new patients, and mending linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND ALLIED PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical practitioners, only
persons whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’ train¬
ing in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist, four or
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
156
more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profes¬
sion is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is the
General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956. The British
Medical Association is the doctors’ professional association; that of the dentists is
the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration as a
general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick children’s, mental,
and mental deficiency nursing. The qualifying period for enrolment as an assistant
nurse is one year’s practical training followed by one year’s work under supervision.
The governing body of the nursing profession is the General Nursing Council, set
up in 1919. Midwives must have the certificate of the Central Midwives Board. Most
pupil midwives are already State Registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses;
for them the two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and, for State
Enrolled Assistant Nurses, to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives.
Only registered pharmaceutical chemists may practise as pharmacists or describe
themselves as such, and qualifications requiring four to five years’ academic study
and practical training are necessary for registration. The Pharmaceutical Society of
Great Britain is the governing body of the profession. Under the Opticians’ Act, 1958,
a General Optical Council regulates the profession of ophthalmic optician and, in
due course, only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners)
will be allowed to test sight. Training takes three years followed by a year
under supervision.
For the professions of almoner, chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory technician,
occupational therapist, psychiatric social worker, physiotherapist, radiographer and
speech therapist a good general education is required followed by a professional train¬
ing. The length and nature of the training varies according to the profession, and may
be as long as three years.
MEDICAL RESEARCH
The Medical Research Council (see p. 209) is the main governmental organisation
engaged in medical research in Britain. A considerable amount of research is also
carried out by the universities and in their associated medical schools and teaching
hospitals, while the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland,
through hospital boards and committees, are also able to maintain research within the
National Health Service.
A valuable contribution to research in particular branches of medicine is made
by private organisations, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the
Nuffield Foundation are probably the largest. There is close co-operation between the
Medical Research Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation of
their respective resources.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council’s programme of work is carried out both in its
own research establishments and by independent investigators, in the universities
and elsewhere, with support from the council in the form of research grants. The pro¬
gramme includes fundamental studies of the structure and natural processes of the
body; clinical and laboratory studies of disease; the development and evaluation of
special methods of treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of
social and occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and mind.
SOCIAL WELFARE
157
In planning and carrying out its programme, the council is assisted by special
advisory committees which it appoints. One of the more important of these is the
Clinical Research Board, set up in consultation with the health departments to assist
the development of clinical research.
EDUCATION
There are nearly nine million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, training colleges or technical colleges in the United Kingdom.
Over 90 per cent of school children attend publicly provided or aided schools. The
universities are independent, self-governing institutions but are aided from public
funds. Most technical colleges and other centres of further education are publicly
maintained. Many schools and colleges continue to benefit from the endowments
provided by benefactors in past centuries.
The bulk of the expenditure on education in the United Kingdom therefore comes
from public funds. It is estimated that the total public expenditure on education,
including university education, will exceed £900 million in the year 1960-61.
In England and Wales, the main development of publicly provided primary educa¬
tion dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of the present
century. In 1833 the Government had begun to make annual grants to the voluntary
societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Education Act of 1870
accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century,
elementary education had become virtually both compulsory and free of charge.
Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England
under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public education in
England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational opportunities at
every stage.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems both have long histories
independent of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now
being implemented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations.
Educational Administration
Administration of publicly provided education in Britain is divided between the
central Government departments (the Ministry of Education for England and Wales,
with its separate Welsh Department, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland), local education authorities, and various
voluntary organisations. The relation between these three groups is based on consulta¬
tion and co-operation, both by direct contact between the parties and through Her
Majesty’s Inspectors who act as liaison officers, particularly between local education
authorities and the departments.
The local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate provision
is made in their areas for the two stages of school education (primary and secondary),
and that those pupils who would profit by proceeding to a university are not deterred
by lack of financial means. They are also responsible for the provision of all forms of
‘further education’, i.e. post-school education outside the universities.
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher of each
school and the individual teachers. In England and Wales, teachers are not subject
to direction from the central department on questions relating to curricula or methods.
Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools includ¬
ing independent schools (which must be registered), review and report on the content
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
I58
and value of the education provided and, during their visits, are available as advisers.
Local education authorities also employ inspectors to advise on the schools which they
maintain. In Scotland, the broad outline of schemes of work in primary and secondary
schools is subject to the approval of one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors. In
Northern Ireland, the curriculum of each grant-aided school is subject to the approval
of the ministry, but considerable latitude is afforded both in the scope of the curriculum
and in the methods employed.
SCHOOLS
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 15. The school¬
leaving age is to be raised to 16 as soon as enough teachers and adequate accommoda¬
tion become available to allow of this being done without thereby increasing the size
of classes. In England and Wales nearly 7 million children, including about 185,000
under and more than 331,000 over compulsory school age, are attending publicly
maintained schools, besides 116,000 others (including 1,500 under and nearly 34,700
over school age) who are at schools receiving direct grants from the Ministry of Educa¬
tion. There are also 496,000 children of all ages at about 4,250 independent schools.
In Scotland, 867,000 children are attending publicly maintained or aided schools and
about 22,000 are at independent schools. In Northern Ireland, 280,000 children (includ¬
ing 7,000 under and 15,000 over compulsory school age) are attending publicly main¬
tained or aided schools; independent schools are few. The number of school children
in Britain is increasing; as the exceptionally large numbers of children born shortly
after the second world war pass from primary to secondary schools, reduced numbers
of primary school children are being more than offset by larger numbers in secondary
schools, especially as more children each year stay on beyond the minimum school¬
leaving age. Moreover, while there was a certain drop in the birthrate after 1949,
the rates for 1958 and 1959 rose again sharply, so that primary school numbers will
again be very high in 1963-64. There is, therefore, a continuing demand for more
teachers and more school buildings.
In England and in Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to be taught
together in primary schools, but rather more than half the secondary schools are
for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales; and in Scotland
all but a few city schools take both boys and girls.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except in classes
for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are co-educational.
In England and Wales, three kinds of school are supported from public funds:
county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained by local education
authorities, i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools (mostly ‘aided’
or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a voluntary body, usually of a
religious denomination, but which are maintained by local education authorities1; and
direct grant schools which are completely independent of local education authorities
but receive a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education. These last (the smallest
group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they include some schools
of ancient foundation.
1 Aided schools have more independence than controlled schools, but they are partly responsible
for maintaining their buildings (see p. 164) whereas controlled schools are not. Over a third of
the schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are nearly 2,000 Roman Catholic
voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.
SOCIAL WELFARE
I59
In Scotland, most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by educa¬
tion authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type
of independent school of which there are also a few in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
see p. 161). There are also a few grant-aided schools (some of ancient foundation)
conducted by voluntary managers and receiving grants direct from the Scottish
Education Department.
In Northern Ireland, there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
management.
In England and Wales, no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supplied
free. Direct grant schools still charge fees but most offer each year, to pupils who
have at any time previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than
two years, free places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year’s
admission; and a further 25 per cent of the places must be put at the disposal of the
local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latter places
need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary school. Day pupils not hold¬
ing free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in accordance with an approved
income scale, and the Ministry of Education pays the governors of the school the
amount of the fees so remitted. Local education authorities also pay for some free
places in independent schools which normally charge fees. A number of independent
schools are able to offer some scholarships from endowments.
In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees in certain schools provided
that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all who desire it.
In Northern Ireland, no fees are charged to parents of children attending any
county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school; qualified pupils attend¬
ing both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships from the local
education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees charged by the school.
Primary Schools
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of n in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery schools and classes
for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales, there are infant schools,
or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 and junior schools for those aged 7 to
11, while in Scotland there are primary departments for children aged 5 to 12 years.
In Scotland, primary pupils must be taught reading, writing, arithmetic, English,
music, art and handwork, nature study, physical training and, at the appropriate
stage, history, geography, and written composition; girls must learn needlework.
Religious instruction is also given. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
curriculum is similar in scope, with the addition in Wales of the teaching of Welsh.
(Children who speak Welsh at home normally receive their primary education in
Welsh and are taught English as a language.)
Secondary Schools
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of giving all children an education suited to their particular abilities.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Since the organisation of schools is a responsibility of local education authorities
in England and Wales, subject to the approval of the ministry, the type of provision
i6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
made for secondary education varies to some extent between areas. In some areas,
different types of school specialise, in particular in the later years, in different types
of course, with arrangements for the transfer of pupils between schools where desirable;
in some areas, flexibility is achieved by an overlap of the courses provided in different
types of school. There are, however, two main types of publicly maintained secondary
schools in England and Wales: grammar schools and secondary modern schools.
Grammar schools take children who hope to reach a university and others likely
to profit from an academic type of education. A large proportion of university students
are recruited from these schools which, in England and Wales, are attended by about
one secondary school pupil in four. Secondary modern schools form the largest group
of secondary schools. They give a general education with a practical bias, closely
related to the interests and environment of their pupils. There is also a small group
of secondary technical schools-, these schools offer an education related to industry,
including commerce, and agriculture, but still general, and not vocational, in purpose.
Each local education authority decides how the selection shall be made for its
secondary schools: generally speaking, this selection depends upon an assessment
of the child’s ability as shown in the primary school, often coupled with objective
tests taken at about eleven years of age, which are commonly known as the ‘eleven-
plus’. There is provision for an appeal to the Minister of Education in the event of
a dispute between a local education authority and a parent, and authorities reconsider
original decisions when subsequent events prove this to be necessary. Both the system
of allocating children to different types of secondary school at the age of eleven and the
selection methods used have been the subject of much public discussion and critical
thought. Local education authorities are constantly experimenting with methods of
selection which will minimise any strain on children or their parents. At the same
time, the authorities are seeking to organise their schools in such a way that every
child will have, and feel that he has, the opportunity to develop his talents to
the full.
The London County Council and some other local education authorities are establish¬
ing comprehensive schools providing all types of secondary education for all, or most of,
the children of a district. In urban areas, such schools tend to be larger than the other
types of school and may have as many as 2,000 pupils.
In Northern Ireland, there are grammar schools, secondary intermediate schools,
which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England and Wales,
and technical intermediate schools which offer the same facilities as secondary technical
schools in England and Wales.
The number of pupils remaining at school beyond the minimum leaving age has
been increasing steadily for some years. Twenty-four per cent of the 16-year-old
age group is now still in full-time education, at schools or technical colleges, and
izi per cent of the 17-year-old age group. Most grammar school pupils remain at
school until they are 16 years old, some until they are 17, 18 or 19 years old. Most
secondary modern pupils at present leave at the age of 15, but the number staying
on until the age of 16 is increasing.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and those
providing courses of four, five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the pupils,
SOCIAL WELFARE
161
and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses. While
some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary, there
are also a number of schools of the comprehensive type in which all kinds of courses,
both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Over one-third of all
pupils go on to senior secondary courses on reaching secondary school age. Many
schools also provide modified courses for pupils of limited ability for whom the
normal courses are too exacting.
Promotion from the primary to the secondary school takes place usually between the
ages of 1and i2|. The fitness of pupils to profit from the various types of secondary
course is assessed on the basis of teachers’ estimates of attainment, intelligence tests,
and attainment tests, with due regard to the wishes of the parents. There is provision
for an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in the event of a dispute between
the education authority and the parent and also for the reconsideration of original
allocations if, later, transfer to another course appears to be necessary.
Independent Schools
The largest and most important of the independent schools are known in England
as public schools, although not all schools classed as public schools are independent
(those which are not are mostly direct-grant schools) and public schools form only a
minority of all independent schools.
The public school is a characteristic English institution which has made a notable
contribution to English education. Many public schools date from the sixteenth
century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, founded in 1382, and Eton, founded in
1440), and most have some income from endowments. Each is controlled by its
own board of governors. Public schools have emphasised the importance of character¬
building, and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby day-to-day
discipline is largely maintained by the pupils themselves, and the house system,
whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50 pupils, each under the care of a
housemaster. The public school is also characterised by a high staffing ratio and a
high proportion of pupils doing advanced work. A public school is often, although
not necessarily, a boarding school; day boys are also taken at some of these boarding
schools. The usual age of entry to the independent public schools for boys is 13 and
the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’ public schools modelled to a certain
extent on the public schools for boys.
Independent schools also include preparatory schools, many of them boarding
schools, for boys aged from about 8 to 13 years most of whom are intending to enter
public schools; some similar schools for girls; and a wide range of other day and
boarding schools covering every age group and grade of education and every variety
of educational method. Some of these schools are owned and managed, often under
a trust deed, by independent non-profit-making bodies. Others are privately owned by
proprietors for whom the running of the school provides a living. All independent
schools must be registered with the ministry.
Secondary School Examinations
In 1951, the General Certificate of Education superseded the former School
Certificate and Higher Certificate examinations in the secondary schools (State-
aided and independent alike) of England and Wales. This examination, which may
also be taken by candidates not attending school, is conducted at three levels (ordinary,
advanced and scholarship). Most grammar school pupils and an increasing number
of pupils from other secondary schools take the examination at ordinary level. Many
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
162
technical college students also take the certificate examinations. The advanced and
scholarship examinations are at university entrance and scholarship level respectively.
Most candidates are at least 16 years old on 1st September of the year of their first
examination, but pupils can sit at an earlier age at the discretion of the headmaster
or headmistress of their school, and many do so.
In Scotland, the courses in senior secondary schools lead to presentation for the
Scottish Leaving Certificate at about the age of 17, although many pupils who are
under that age take the examination. The certificate, which can be taken only by
pupils in attendance at Scottish schools, is awarded on examinations conducted by
the Scottish Education Department. To encourage pupils who might leave at the
age of 15 to stay at school for at least another year, a new ordinary grade leaving
certificate for fourth year senior secondary school pupils (who are usually about
16 years old) is to be introduced in 1962.
In Northern Ireland, the Junior Certificate Examination is taken at about the age
of 15 and the Senior Certificate Examination, which is conducted at two levels, at
about 17 years of age.
Teachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. In 1959, there was one full-time teacher to 26 pupils in publicly main¬
tained primary and secondary schools in England and Wales; the figure was 24 for
Scotland and 27 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second
world war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers and,
as more teachers enter the profession, the Government’s first aim in educational
improvements is to reduce the size of over-large classes to the statutory maxima of
40 for a primary school and 30 for a secondary.
There are 154 teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales; in the academic
year 1959-60 there were over 31,000 students in these colleges, and the number is
expected to rise to 36,000 by 1963; many colleges are being extended and several
new colleges are to be built. Up to the present the usual training course has lasted for
two years, with three-year courses for women taking housecraft or physical education,
but the ordinary course was extended to three years from September i960. There are 24
university departments of education providing a one-year course for graduates.
In Scotland, there are four general colleges of education, two denominational colleges
and a college for training women teachers of physical education. Courses are normally
of one year’s duration for graduates or the equivalent, and of three years for non¬
graduates. Northern Ireland has two general teachers’ training colleges, one university
training department and three specialist colleges—one for training teachers of physical
education, one for teachers of domestic science and one for teachers of art. The basic
course in the general training colleges lasts three years. The education departments,
the universities, local education authorities and other bodies provide a variety of
short courses for practising teachers.
Teachers from schools in the United Kingdom go to a number of overseas countries
each year under interchange schemes or schemes for temporary overseas posts. About
90 teachers from the United States and about 40 teachers from Canada exchange posts
for a year with teachers from Britain, and similar exchange schemes, on a smaller
scale, operate between Britain and Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. There are also official schemes operating
between Britain and several other European countries for similar exchanges and for
temporary assistants’ posts for language specialists.
SOCIAL WELFARE
163
I here are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland, and these scales influence the salaries paid to teachers in
independent schools. There are also national superannuation schemes which are
administered by the central departments.
In England and Wales, agreed salary scales are submitted to the Minister of
Education by joint committees of representatives of local education authorities’ and
teachers associations. The best known of these committees are the Burnham
C ommittees dealing with the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools and
in establishments of further education. I he minister can accept or reject (but not
modify) the committees recommendations and make the approved scales mandatory
on local education authorities.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out 53 sound transmissions a week which reach more than 29,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, over 70 per cent of the possible total. Television broadcasts
to schools were begun in 1957 by both the British Broadcasting Corporation and
Associated Rediffusion Limited. In June i960, nearly 3,000 schools were equipped
to receive the television programmes. From September i960, the BBC has broadcast
to schools nine television series a week and, with repeat broadcasts, a total of 20
transmissions each week; the Associated Rediffusion programmes for schools have also
been extended. Neither sound nor television broadcasting attempts to cover the whole
school curriculum, or to replace the teacher; the purpose is to supplement existing
work in the schools. Other visual aids to education—films, film strips, wall charts,
pictures, and models—are being increasingly used in Britain’s schools.
Religion in Schools
In England and Wales, all children in county or voluntary schools, that is, all
schools wholly or partly financed by local authorities, receive religious instruction
and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless their parents object. In county
schools, and in certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of
an undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In county schools in Northern
Ireland, clergy have a right of access to give religious instruction to children of their
denomination for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for
the individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in the hands of
the school managers, but there are a number of denominational schools conducted
by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part of the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum of all
schools.
I he School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain free
treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education authorities.
Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child guidance centres. (There are
also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern Ireland the
School Health Service is operated by the health authorities.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
164
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children who
wish to have it, and the School Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a subsidised
price (remitted where there is need) to nearly half the pupils in county and voluntary
schools. Education authorities have power to provide free transport for children who
live more than a reasonable distance from the schools which they attend; this distance
is defined as two miles for those under eight years and three miles for those over eight
years (11 years in Northern Ireland).
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
between the ages of five (or less) and 16 for children who require it on account of
any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment. There are about 950
special schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and boarding
schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
School Building
An extensive building programme for education has been undertaken in Britain
since the end of the second world war. Many war-damaged schools had to be repaired
or rebuilt. Entirely new schools, both primary and secondary, were needed to provide
for the increased number of children of school age, for the many post-war housing
estates and for the new towns; new buildings were also needed to replace or improve
those which were out of date and ill-equipped by modern standards. Although 5,588
new post-war schools had been completed in the United Kingdom by the end of
1959, nearly 600 more were under construction, and extensions had been made to a
very large number of existing schools, much remains to be done. Early in 1959, the
Government announced a school building programme for the five years 1960-65
amounting in value to about £300 million in England and Wales and £65 million
in Scotland; in Northern Ireland plans for 118 more schools had been passed by the
end of 1959 and were expected to be completed within three years.
To help voluntary schools to keep pace with county schools in the standard of
their buildings, the Education Act, 1959, raised the rate of grant for alterations,
improvements and external repairs to 75 per cent of the approved cost. With a few
exceptions, the schools affected are Church of England or Roman Catholic aided
schools. (The whole cost of maintenance of all denominational schools in Scotland,
as of voluntary controlled schools in England and Wales, is borne by public funds.)
Grants will also be made for building new aided secondary schools needed for children
from aided primary schools which existed on 15th June, 1959.
Advantage is being taken of the opportunity afforded by the extensive post-war
building programme to raise standards in public educational building and to introduce
new ideas and methods in the design and construction of schools. Education authorities
are using both traditional and new methods of building. Post-war school buildings
are light and airy, with an imaginative use of colour and generous provision of practical
rooms and space for outdoor games.
Local education authorities are responsible for providing the schools and other
buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central departments exercise
control by approving annual building programmes, framing regulations, fixing cost
limits and approving or rejecting the authorities’ plans; they also offer guidance to
authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
UNIVERSITIES
There are 22 universities in the United Kingdom: 16 in England, four in Scotland,
the University of Wales, and the Queen’s University of Belfast in Northern Ireland.
SOCIAL WELFARE 165
The English universities are: Oxford, Cambridge, London, Birmingham, Bristol,
Durham, Exeter, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham,
Reading, Sheffield and Southampton. There is also the University College of North
Staffordshire, which is empowered to award its own Bachelor of Arts degree. A new
University College of Sussex is planned to start taking students in 1961.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the other universities were
founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are each composed of a number of
residential colleges. These colleges are corporate bodies governed by their own Fellows
and distinct from the university. Most of the Fellows of the colleges are university
teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also Fellows of colleges.
The universities, as distinct from the colleges, own the main libraries, laboratories,
and other buildings used for teaching and research.
The other universities in Britain are in the main non-residential and most are non-
collegiate. Those composed of groups of largely autonomous colleges are London,
which with over 20,000 students is by far the largest of Britain’s universities; Durham,
which includes King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne1; and St. Andrews, which con¬
sists of colleges in St. Andrews itself and in Dundee. The University of Wales comprises
the University Colleges of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff and Swansea, and the Welsh
National School of Medicine at Cardiff.
The education departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
provision of extra-mural education, and the award of scholarships from public funds.
The universities receive aid from the State mainly in the form of direct grants from the
Treasury which, in Great Britain, are made on the advice of the University Grants
Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from persons
with wide experience of schools and universities, or experience in industry.
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is increasing and
in 1958-59 was 69-7 per cent for the United Kingdom. Another 2-9 per cent was
contributed by local authorities, 11 per cent by fees, and the balance by endowments
and other sources.
Students
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no religious
test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with men, but at Cambridge
their numbers are limited by statute (as they were at Oxford until 1957). The general
proportion of men to women students is three to one; at Oxford it is six to one, and at
Cambridge ten to one.
All universities in Britain limit the number of undergraduates; in spite of the increase
in these limits which has taken place since the end of the second world war, the demand
for places continues to be very keen and many candidates are unable to gain entrance
to the university of their first choice.
At the beginning of the academic year 1959-60, there were 105,200 full-time
students at universities or university colleges in the United Kingdom. This total,
more than double the pre-war figure, is to be still further expanded (see p. 167).
1 A proposal to separate King’s College from Durham and establish it as an independent
university is under consideration.

Scholarships and Other Awards
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the national
educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by lack of means from
taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere. About 80 per cent of university
students in Great Britain are now aided from public or private funds.
The Ministry of Education offers about 2,000 State scholarships annually on open
competition for full-time honours courses at universities and, in addition, it gives
some 1,500 new supplementary grants each year to winners of open scholarships
awarded by the universities and colleges from their own funds. The ministry also
awards 225 technical State scholarships annually. (These and the ordinary State
scholarships may be held at a technical college instead of a university for courses of
appropriate level.)
Local education authorities in England and Wales make awards to over 16,000
other students each year to enable them to enter a university.
State studentships for postgraduate study in arts subjects are offered annually by
the Ministry of Education; 246 were awarded in 1959. Postgraduate awards for scientists
and technologists are made by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
and the Research Councils.
In Scotland, the power of awarding bursaries and scholarships is confined in the
main to the education authorities who, in exercising this power, are required to
comply with regulations made by the Secretary of State. There is provision, however,
for awards to be made by the Secretary of State to people who have strong connections
with Scotland which make it desirable that they should be eligible for assistance from
Scottish funds, but who do not have the necessary residential qualifications for a
bursary from an education authority. There are no State scholarships, but the Secretary
of State supplements scholarships at English universities won in open competition by
Scottish students.
University scholarships in Northern Ireland are awarded by the local education
authorities. The Ministry of Education awards State exhibitions. Scholarships awarded
by the universities and State exhibitions may be supplemented by local education
authorities. Postgraduate awards are made by the Ministry of Education.
Studies and Degrees
Courses in arts and science are offered by all universities and, at nearly all universities,
courses are available in one or more applied sciences. At the beginning of the academic
year 1959-60, 43 per cent of full-time university students in Great Britain were taking
arts courses and 57 per cent were studying science or technology (including medicine).
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though in
medicine five or six years are required. The first degree of Bachelor (Master in Scotland)
is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory examination
results. In most universities an ordinary (or pass) degree or an honours degree can
be taken, although the majority of students in England and Wales take honours courses.
Further study or research is required at the modern universities for the degree of
Master and by all universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according
to the practice of each university; some differentiate between the arts and sciences
and some do not. Diplomas and certificates are awarded after shorter courses in
some subjects.
The tutorial system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture system is a
traditional and valued feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; it is now
being developed in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
SOCIAL WELFARE
167
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all universities
there are postgraduate students engaged in research. There has been an expansion
particularly of research in science and technology in recent years (see p. 203).
University Expansion
The universities of Britain are expanding rapidly to meet the greatly increased
demand for university education and also the need of a modern democracy for a highly
educated population and the particular need, in a technical age, for scientists and
technologists.
An increase in the number of full-time students in universities in Great Britain
from 100,000 in 1958-59 to 135,000 in the latter half of the 1960s has already been
agreed; and the possibility of providing an additional 35,000 to 40,000 places by the
late 1960s is now being explored. About two-thirds of the additional students who
are expected to be in the universities by about 1965 will be students of science or
technology.
An extensive building programme is in progress to provide for the increased number
of students. In particular, halls of residence are being built to enable a higher proportion
of students to enjoy the intellectual, social and cultural advantages of community life,
and many new science buildings are needed to provide up-to-date facilities for the
increasing proportion of science students.
Building projects in Great Britain to the value of ^12 million were begun in each
of the years 1958 and 1959 and projects to the value of ^15 million have been authorised
to start in each of the four years 1960-63. These figures exclude the expansion of the
Imperial College of Science and Technology in the University of London where
separate special provision is being made for a doubling of numbers—from 1,650 in
1952 (when the plans were first approved) to 3,300—at a total cost of over
£15 million. These amounts, together with additional sums for the purchase of sites
and properties and the provision of equipment for new buildings, are met from
Exchequer funds; further sums are collected by the universities themselves.
Of the major projects included in the annual programmes for the period 1960-63
about 56 per cent by value is for buildings to accommodate teaching and research in
the various faculties, including about 44 per cent for science subjects and technology.
The remaining 44 per cent by value is for general service buildings, such as halls of
residence, student unions, refectories and libraries.
FURTHER EDUCATION
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time
and part-time, for those of all ages who have left school. Local education authorities
are required to secure such provision either directly or by aiding voluntary bodies
and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at all levels and in all subjects
are available in technical, commercial and art colleges1 and in evening institutes.
These courses may lead to a wide variety of qualifications ranging from external
university degrees and the highest technological awards to craftsman’s certificates,
or they may offer opportunities for pursuing leisure-time interests. In the year 1958-59,
there were some 108,000 full-time students at the technical and commercial colleges
(excluding art colleges and agricultural institutes) in Great Britain and some ii
million part-time students. An increasing number of young employees, apprentices
and others (473,000 in Great Britain in 1958-59) are released by their employers to

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
attend technical or general education classes during working hours and the Government
is urging industrial and commercial concerns to encourage more of their young people
to attend such classes. Nearly a million other students attend evening institutes.
Technical and Technological Education
Within the field of further education, facilities for technical and technological
education have been expanded greatly since the second world war and the Government
is promoting further development. In 1956, the Government announced a five-year
programme for the expansion of technical colleges designed to provide for an increase
of about half as many again in the number of students completing advanced courses
and to double the numbers released by their employers for part-time courses during
the day. The cost of the programme for buildings and equipment in the five years
from 1956 to 1961 was estimated at nearly £100 million, comprising £70 million to
be spent on buildings and £15 million on equipment in England and Wales, and ^10
million for buildings and ^2 million for equipment in Scotland. A further £15 million
a year in England and Wales and £2 million in Scotland is to be spent on buildings for
technical education in each of the three years from 1961 to 1964. The expansion of
advanced courses of further education is being helped by sharing the cost among all
local education authorities.
The largest group of students attending technical colleges are young employees
and apprentices who are released by their employers for study, usually on one day a
week; day release study is often supplemented by attendance at evening classes. A
wide variety of craft courses is available for young workers in various trades and
■occupations leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of three to
five years. Courses of a more professional character which are suitable for technicians
or for those who aim ultimately at membership of a professional institution are also
provided, leading to the National Certificates approved by joint committees representa¬
tive of the education departments and the appropriate professional body, e.g., the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Such courses are normally at two levels, ordinary
and higher. Most courses for the ordinary certificate last three years and students
usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19. The higher certificate requires a
further two years’ part-time study and is generally considered to reach a level
corresponding to a pass degree in the subject concerned.
Full-time courses are taken by large numbers of younger students who leave school
to enter secretarial or clerical work and also as an introduction to apprenticeship.
But the most important group of full-time students are those following advanced
courses leading to an external degree of the University of London, to the Higher
National Diploma (awarded by joint committees in the same way as the Higher
National Certificates) or to the Diploma in Technology (a national qualification first
awarded in 195^)* The Diploma in Technology (Dip. Tech.) is granted on the
successful completion of an approved course in a technical college and is equivalent
in standard to a university honours degree. It is administered by the National Council
for Technological Awards, an autonomous body set up by the Minister of Education
The council has also instituted an award higher than the diploma—Membership
of the College of Technologists (MCT).
The form of advanced full-time course which is rapidly gaining favour is the ‘sand¬
wich course’. This lasts from three to five years and consists of periods usually of three
or six months spent alternately in studying full-time in a technical college and in
gaining practical experience in industry; the majority of Diploma in Technology
courses are sandwich courses. In the academic year 1958-59 there were 8,516 sandwich

course students. It is through a major increase in the number of students taking sand¬
wich courses that the technical colleges are expected to achieve a 50 per cent increase
in the output of advanced students.
There is a growing demand for courses of postgraduate standard, whether in tech¬
nical subjects or in management studies, in technical colleges for students who have
already obtained a first degree, a diploma, or a Higher National Certificate. A wide
range of advanced short courses of a very specialised nature is also offered for senior
technical staffs engaged in industry. A considerable amount of research is also carried
on in the technical colleges: the arrangements vary widely and frequently take the form
of a contract between the college and a local industrial concern.
Under this system there is great flexibility in the arrangement of courses. As a
result, young people can start courses at various ages on leaving school and can attain
the highest qualification to which their abilities entitle them.
Technical colleges in England and Wales vary greatly in size, range of subjects,
level of work and type of course. The largest has a total of some 14,000 students on
the roll. The large colleges usually offer a wide variety of subjects, covering the basic
technologies and the fundamental sciences. The colleges are organised in five
broad groups:
(1) Local Colleges (350), providing mainly part-time courses, some (lasting two
to five years) leading directly to craftsman and technician qualifications such
as Ordinary National Certificates and City and Guilds of London Institute
Certificates;
(2) Area Colleges (170), providing also some advanced courses from two to four
years in duration for students starting at 18 or 19 years of age, and leading
to Higher National Certificates and Diplomas;
(3) Regional Colleges (22), covering wider areas than the local and area colleges,
and doing a substantial amount of advanced work, including full-time and
sandwich courses;
(4) Colleges of Advanced Technology concentrating entirely on advanced work,
including postgraduate and research work, and comprising the following
nine colleges: the Birmingham College of Technology; the Bradford Institute
of Technology; the Welsh College of Advanced Technology, Cardiff; Lough¬
borough College of Technology; the Royal Technical College, Salford; the
Bristol College of Technology (from September i960); and, in London, the
Battersea, Chelsea and Northampton Colleges of Advanced Technology (in
the north-east of England, the Rutherford Technical College, Newcastle upon
Tyne, has been selected as a potential college of advanced technology); and
(5) National Colleges, of which seven have been established to provide advanced
courses for the particularly specialised techniques of certain industries.
These include colleges such as those for Rubber Technology and Food
Technology and the National Foundry College; they are managed by
independent bodies with grants direct from the Ministry of Education.
At present, in England and Wales, there are 396 technical colleges (other than art
colleges) that provide for full-time students, besides 162 others which take part-time
students only.
Scotland has 16 Central Institutions for further education, of which seven are
technical colleges. Five of these have full-time courses leading to their own diploma
or associateship and, in some, the greater part of the work is full-time. The full-time
courses are of three or four years’ duration and comparable in scope and standard

to university degree courses. There are close ties between the central institutions
and the universities. The central institutions, working on a regional basis, are sup¬
ported by some 50 local technical colleges, offering full-time and part-time day courses,
and by evening classes at local centres. Eighteen new colleges are expected to open
in the early 1960s.
In Northern Ireland, the system of technical education is similar to that in England
and Wales and includes courses leading to National Certificates. The Ministry of
Education for Northern Ireland awards junior and senior trade scholarships to appren¬
tices, to enable them to follow full-time courses of study at the Belfast College of
Technology, 'fhe junior course lasts five months and the senior course eight months.
Most of the technical colleges and other further education establishments in the
United Kingdom are either maintained or aided from public funds. Tuition fees are
therefore moderate, and often nominal for young people under 18 years of age. Many
full-time students are helped by awards from local education authorities. The awards
are generally based on the results of the General Certificate of Education or a corre¬
sponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance
grant, but parents who can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so.
There are also some scholarships available from endowments, and others are awarded
under schemes organised by particular industries or companies for the most promising
of their young workers. In England and Wales, State scholarships (see p. 166) are
available for advanced technological courses.
Commercial Education
Commercial education is provided in local authority commercial and technical
colleges, in independent colleges and by bodies organising correspondence courses.
Well over half the candidates taking professional examinations in commercial subjects
do so through correspondence courses.
In England and Wales, local education authorities maintain about 200 establish¬
ments that offer commercial courses at or above intermediate (i.e. Ordinary National
Certificate) level: there are 15 colleges of commerce, over 170 commerce departments
in technical and other colleges, and nearly 20 establishments which have advanced
courses in commercial subjects in the evenings only.
The tradition of relying mainly on evening study has continued longer in
commercial education than in technical education, but the Advisory Committee on
Further Education for Commerce of the National Advisory Council on Education
for Industry and Commerce, in a report published in March 1959, recommended
a big expansion of facilities for commercial education in England and Wales, on the
lines of that already taking place in technical and technological education. In particular,
the report recommends the wider adoption of commercial apprenticeship schemes
and the expansion of day release and sandwich schemes.
Adult Education
Adult education (non-vocational study, outside the universities, for those who
have left school) is organised by local education authorities (sometimes in association
with voluntary bodies) in evening institutes, schools of art, adult education centres,
community centres and youth clubs. Many of the classes are practical, but there are
also wide opportunities for academic study at all levels. Voluntary organisations, such
as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and the National Union of Towns¬
women’s Guilds, offer courses in handicrafts and other subjects to their members;
the local education authorities usually supply the teachers.
SOCIAL WELFARE
I7I
In general, courses at the highest levels in arts subjects are provided by the extra¬
mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time staff appointed
for this purpose and can call on the services of other members of the university staff;
by the Workers’ Educational Association, which also employs organising tutors and in
many regions works in close collaboration with the university extra-mural departments;
and by other voluntary bodies. In 1958-59, 170,000 students in England and Wales
attended such courses, which are grant-aided directly by the Ministry of Education and,
in many cases, are assisted financially and in other ways by local education authorities.
Voluntary bodies with a particular view-point, such as the National Council of
Labour Colleges and the Co-operative Union, also organise adult education courses
without grant-aid. Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales and one in
Scotland) directly aided by the education departments offer one-year or two-year
cultural, non-vocational courses for adult students. In addition, there are about 30
other residential colleges where students can take short courses of a similar kind lasting
for a few days or a few weeks. Most of these latter colleges are maintained or aided
by local education authorities.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of informa¬
tion and research for adult education, as well as a channel of co-operation and
consultation for the many organisations in England and Wales which are interested
in the subject. It is assisted by a grant from the Ministry of Education. The Scottish
Institute of Adult Education performs similar functions in Edinburgh.
Local education authorities can provide community centres for urban areas; these
centres normally supply facilities for both vocational and non-vocational classes
for the further education of young people and adults. The centres are usually managed
by community associations, many of which are affiliated to the National Federation
of Community Associations. Similar classes in rural areas are held in village halls and a
variety of other premises by local education authorities and voluntary bodies; in
Cambridgeshire there are nine ‘village colleges’, which combine facilities for secondary
and adult education, and a similar ‘college’ was opened in Derbyshire in 1958.
Financial assistance is given by the education departments to local voluntary
organisations towards the capital cost of community centres, village halls, playing
fields and similar facilities for social and physical recreation for adults.
OVERSEAS STUDENTS IN BRITAIN
Opportunities for students from overseas to come to Britain to study in universities
or other educational institutions, or to obtain specialised training in industry or
elsewhere, have greatly expanded since the second world war. There are some 45,000
overseas students in Britain, of whom about one-quarter are at universities, another
quarter at technical colleges, and the remainder training for the law, in industry,
or at hospitals as doctors or nurses. In the year 1959-60, Britain’s universities contained
7,000 students from Commonwealth countries overseas and 4,000 students from
foreign countries. About 300 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one

English language overseas and to develop closer cultural relations with other countries. It was
founded in 1934 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1940. Nine of the 30 members of its executive
committee are nominated by Government departments; it is financed almost entirely from
public funds. It is usually designated as the Government’s principal instrument for the implemen¬
tation of cultural conventions to which the United Kingdom is a party. The council maintains
staffs who in some 70 overseas countries, foster English studies, provide regular information on
British life and thought and promote knowledge of the scientific, literary and other developments
and achievements of the United Kingdom. It arranges study programmes in the United Kingdom
for scholars, teachers and other professional visitors from overseas.

year in the United Kingdom, are awarded annually to graduates of overseas universities.
Twenty-four Marshall Scholarships for university study in Britain are offered annually
by the United Kingdom Government to graduates from the United States of America,
and the universities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate
students of any nationality are eligible. Some two-thirds of all overseas students are
from the Commonwealth.
Some universities and other educational institutions in the United Kingdom
annually reserve a proportion of their places for students from the United Kingdom
dependencies. At the end of 1959, there were over 18,000 students from United
Kingdom dependencies studying in the United Kingdom or the Irish Republic,
over 3,000 of them at universities. Of the total, 3,634 held scholarships. The chief
sources of grants are funds set aside by Colonial Governments (sometimes supple¬
mented by United Kingdom Colonial Development and Welfare funds) and funds
contributed by public boards and corporations in the territories.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from Common¬
wealth countries overseas. In the year 1959-60, United Kingdom Government funds
amounting to about £620,500 were available for this purpose. Under the Athlone
Fellowship Scheme, for example, the United Kingdom Government has from 1951
awarded 38 fellowships a year to engineering graduates in Canada for up to two years’
further study, training or research in institutions or industries in Britain. Under the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, more than 1,000 scholarships have
been offered by the governments of certain Commonwealth countries; these awards
will be offered to men and women from other Commonwealth countries and will be
tenable at universities, colleges and other institutions of higher education in the
country of offer. The United Kingdom Government will offer 500; of these, up to 250
had been announced, in June i960, as available for tenure in the United Kingdom
in 1960-61.
Under the United Nations Programmes of Technical Assistance, nearly 600 holders
of fellowship awards came to Britain between 1st April, 1959, and 31st March, i960,
for study or training, a larger number than ever before and almost certainly a greater
number than received in any other country during that period. Similarly, under the
Technical Co-operation Scheme of the Colombo Plan for Economic Development in
South and South-East Asia, 667 trainees came to Britain during that same period
for industrial or other practical training or for postgraduate research or study of
some kind.
During the same period under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Foundation
for Mutual Assistance in Africa South of the Sahara, and the British Technical Assis¬
tance Programmes for Yugoslavia and Ghana, 92 Fellowships and training awards
were taken up for study at British training institutions of many kinds.
Arrangements for Overseas Students
Various bodies in the United Kingdom, official and unofficial, have assumed
responsibility for the welfare of overseas students. Guidance is available from the
External Relations and General Branch of the Ministry of Education. The Common¬
wealth Relations Office is also closely associated with educational schemes for students
from the overseas member nations of the Commonwealth and from the Federation
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and is concerned with their welfare. The Students’
Branch of the Colonial Office is responsible for placing scholarship holders and recom¬
mended students from the United Kingdom dependencies in universities and teacher
SOCIAL WELFARE

training colleges. Student offices, set up in the United Kingdom by the majority of
the dependencies and by some overseas Commonwealth member nations, are responsible
for the placing of students from their territories in technical colleges, and for practical
training and the general welfare of their students.
Students from overseas are given many opportunities to get to know more of
Britain in their leisure time and to make friends with British people. The British
Council offers a wide range of interesting and instructive activities. The council
has overseas students’ centres in London and in other university cities, which organise
a varied programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities. Many
British people like to invite students to their homes and the British Council arranges
introductions. In the vacations, there are courses in many parts of the United
Kingdom which offer excellent opportunities for getting to know more about British
life in town and country. In term time there are visits to various places of interest,
and theatre and concert parties are arranged. The British Council assists many students-
to find accommodation, particularly those from the United Kingdom dependencies
and from a number of other Commonwealth and foreign countries. They are met on
arrival and helped to settle down quickly in their new environment.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas students
are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria League,
the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union
of Students, the English-Speaking Union and Churches of all denominations. The
London Conference on Overseas Students, on which the British Council and Govern¬
ment departments are represented, co-ordinates their work in the metropolis. In some
London boroughs there are committees which help students to make contact with
local residents and organisations. Similar conferences have come into being in other
large cities of the United Kingdom.
British Students Overseas
It was estimated by UNESCO (Study Abroad, 1959) that in 1957-58 there were
some 2,500 students from the United Kingdom at institutes of higher education in i&
countries overseas. About 1,500 were postgraduates.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit, set up after the Commonwealth
Education Conference in 1959, supplements normal direct dealings on education
between the countries of the Commonwealth. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, United Kingdom students are competing for scholarships
tenable from i960 or 1961, in Australia, Canada, East Africa, Hong Kong, Malaya,
New Zealand and South Africa.
For many years the United States have offered awards for British students, the
best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at American
universities. Students of British nationality are also offered scholarships (mostly for
one academic year) at institutes for higher education in 15 European countries, and in
Brazil, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Japan.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of the youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time activities-
of young people and to offer them opportunities—complementary to those of home,
formal education and work—for discovering and developing their personal resources,,
so that they may be better equipped to be responsible members of a free and civilised
society. There is no regimentation of young people; they are free to join any of the
J74
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
youth organisations, or none, and the aim is to offer facilities sufficiently varied to
appeal to every type of boy and girl.
State and Voluntary Partnership
Responsibility for youth services in the United Kingdom is shared by the education
departments, local education authorities and voluntary organisations. There is no
attempt to impose uniformity or to create any national youth organisation, but a number
of youth organisations have spontaneously developed over the last century, mainly by
voluntary effort. Between the two world wars, some of the local education authorities
tried to help and co-ordinate voluntary work in their areas through Juvenile Organisa¬
tions Committees; in the 1930s the State also began to promote social and physical
training and recreation and in 1939 brought into being what is now called the Youth
Service as a partnership of voluntary organisations, local authorities and central
Government.
The status of youth services as an essential part of the educational system of Great
Britain was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944 and the Education (Scotland)
Act of 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work was promoted by the Physical
Training and Recreation Act of 1938 and the Youth Welfare Acts of 1944 and 1947.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative and training
work of national voluntary youth organisations, towards the expense of training full¬
time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises and equipment of youth
clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in their areas:
most give some financial help and the loan of premises and equipment; most also
employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encouragement of youth work;
where voluntary services are considered inadequate, local authorities themselves
organise youth centres and clubs. Most local authorities have appointed youth
committees on which official and voluntary bodies are represented.
In addition to such grants as are received from the State and local authorities,
voluntary organisations may receive help from charitable trusts for the furtherance of
special projects, notably from the King George’s Jubilee Trust and the King George VI
Foundation (see p. 142). The greater part of the funds of the voluntary organisations is,
however, raised by their own efforts.
In 1958 the Minister of Education, aware that the Youth Service needed to do more
to assist young people, appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Lady
Albemarle, to review the situation and advise on steps to be taken. The minister
accepted in principle the committee’s recommendations, published in its report in
February i960, and announced immediate increases in financial help for the head¬
quarters of national voluntary organisations, a building programme of £7 million to be
started in the next three years, more grants to voluntary projects, including experimental
ones, and immediate steps towards increasing the number of trained full-time leaders.
The minister is advised by a Youth Service Development Council.
As there had been in recent years a number of reports by advisory bodies in Scotland
relating to youth provision, the Secretary of State did not set up a committee of inquiry
similar to the Albemarle Committee but decided instead, after consultation with the
statutory and voluntary bodies concerned, to set up a Standing Consultative Council
on Youth Service in Scotland, under the chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon, to
review the youth service and to promote the development of the service. The Standing
Consultative Council, whose initial tenure of office is for two years from December
1959, is expected to advise not only the Secretary of State but also all organisations
SOCIAL WELFARE 175
engaged in youth service. It is broadly similar to the Youth Service Development
Council set up in England and Wales.
Although the Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales,
many of the main recommendations of the report apply to Scotland, while a few
already reflect the Scottish position. As in England and Wales, increased financial
assistance is being made available from central funds to national voluntary organisations
in Scotland; any increased expenditure by Scottish education authorities on direct or
indirect provision in their areas will be regarded as relevant expenditure for the purposes
of the calculation of the general grant to be allocated for the next period.
The Voluntary Organisations
The backbone of the youth services is the voluntary organisations. Although their
programmes vary greatly, most of them provide educational and religious activities
as well as social and recreational pursuits for their members, and all of them seek to
inculcate high ideals of personal conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-six large national voluntary youth organisations are constituent members of
the Standing Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organisations, which is a con¬
sultative body that takes action only in the name of its member bodies and with their
consent. A further 18 bodies are associate or observer members. These major organisa¬
tions have a total membership of some 3 million young people under 21. The
corresponding body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary
Youth Organisations.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose are the
Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s Christian
Association (YWCA), with approximately 37,500 and 14,000 members under 21
respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (158,000), the Church Lads’ Brigade (19,000), the
Girls’ Life Brigade (63,000), the Girls’ Friendly Society (25,000), Girls’ Guildry
(31,000), the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs (118,000), the Salvation Army
Youth Organisations (67,000), the Catholic Young Men’s Society of Great Britain
(25,000), the Young Christian Workers (16,000), the Grail (13,000), and the Association
of Jewish Youth (12,000).
The Boy Scouts’ Association and Girl Guides’ Association have world-wide affilia¬
tions; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded by Lord
Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good citizenship in boys and
girls. They have various sections, based on age groups, but the largest number are
under 16 years. Their total United Kingdom membership is about 505,400 scouts and
505,800 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with over 2,000 affiliated clubs and 152,000
members, and the National Association of Mixed Clubs and Girls’ Clubs, with over
2,500 affiliated clubs and 143,500 members, are concerned mainly with the 14 to 20 age-
group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all try to give their members oppor¬
tunities to take part in physical, mental and social activities, to develop their capacities
and grow to maturity as individuals and members of society. Representatives from
clubs form local committees and these send representatives to the national members’
councils.
The National Association of Training Corps for Girls, with about 8,000 members,
comprises the Girls’ Training Corps, the Women’s Junior Air Corps and the Girls’
Nautical Training Corps; all wear uniform and formal discipline is encouraged. The
pre-Service organisations (the Combined Cadet Force, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet
Force and Air Training Corps), combine social, educational and physical development

•with training for possible entry into the armed forces; their combined membership
is about 160,000.
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales has
over 42,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish Association of Young
Farmers’ Clubs has nearly 7,000 and Northern Ireland Clubs over 2,500 members:
in addition to encouraging interest in agriculture and appreciation of country life,
the clubs provide training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve
the community.
The Welsh League of Youth (Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership of about
83,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among the youth of Wales’,
and its work takes full account of the Welsh background of its members.
The Youth Hostels Associations have in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland a network of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particularly intended for young
people of limited means. They seek to promote knowledge and love of the countryside,
and are closely linked with each other and with similar organisations in other countries.
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross Society,
St. John Ambulance Brigade and the leading political parties.
Other Organisations Concerned with Youth Work
King George’s Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 to advance the welfare of the
younger generation: the Trust Fund is applied for the benefit of the young people of
the United Kingdom. King George V sanctioned the inauguration of the Trust by the
then Prince of Wales, and the dedication to it of the nation’s gift of approximately
^1 million, subscribed as a thank-offering to mark his silver jubilee. The income is
augmented by gifts and legacies and the Trust has made grants of well over £1 million
for the benefit of young people.
The King George VI Foundation was set up in 1953 to administer a memorial fund
in remembrance of the King. The Foundation’s work has been completed by the
expenditure, through existing voluntary organisations, of nearly j£i-2 million on
schemes for the benefit of young people (besides other expenditure on schemes for the
old). The principal youth service schemes are the King George VI Leadership Training
Memorial, from which £564,500 has been allocated to 34 organisations; the King
George VI National Recreation Centre Scheme, through which £400,000 has been
provided for centres for training sports coaches, leaders and instructors; and the
King George VI Memorial Hostel Scheme, which has provided five new youth
hostels with the £163,000 allocated. The Foundation also financed, at the cost of
£50,000 over three years, the experimental stage of the Duke of Edinburgh’s
Award Scheme.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme for boys is operated by local authorities,
schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies, and is designed as a
challenge to boys between the ages of 14 and 19 to reach standards of achievement
in three progressive stages in leisure-time activities comprising public service, expedi¬
tions and pursuits and fitness. A similar scheme for girls was launched in 1958 as an
experiment for girls between the ages of 14 and 20. The three progressive stages cover
the following sections: design for living, interests, and adventure and service. The
scheme is still in an experimental phase.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains five schools which offer 26-day character¬
building courses for boys, based on adventure and testing experience. Modified
■courses are held for girls.
SOCIAL WELFARE
I??
The Central Council of Physical Recreation is not specifically a youth organisation as
it also caters for adults, but it provides practical and advisory services in all branches
of physical recreation for many youth organisations. The Central Council and the
Scottish Council administer five National Recreation Centres which between them
provide training in the leadership and performance of a very wide range of activities.
The National Playing Fields Association promotes the provision and preservation
of public playing fields and playgrounds for young people and adults through its 50
county and city associations in England and Wales and its branches in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The Association provides technical and advisory services in addition
to giving financial grants to approved playing field and playground schemes.
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large number of
town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for general or particular
purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table tennis or jazz clubs, for instance.
In small communities social clubs may not be specifically for young people but those
with the more strenuous activities (e.g., tennis clubs) usually have a high proportion
of young people as members.
VI. HOUSING AND
PLANNING
PROBLEMS AND ADMINISTRATION
The problems of housing and of planning the use of land in Britain have their
origins mainly in the sevenfold expansion of the population in the last two and a
half centuries and its concentration in industrial urban areas, which gave rise to over¬
crowding in the older houses in the centres of cities and to the unplanned spread of
outer suburbs. In spite of a high rate of building in the nineteen-thirties, the second
world war left Britain facing formidable problems of housing and planning. The need
and scope for much rebuilding resulted from enemy action, which destroyed or damaged
approximately one house in three.
Ministerial Responsibility for Housing and Planning
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is responsible in England and
Wales for formulating housing policy, for housing standards and for general super¬
vision of the housing programme. In planning, the minister is responsible for imple¬
menting general policy regarding the use and development of land throughout England
and Wales, and for the direction and guidance of local planning authorities, the new
towns development corporations and the National Parks Commission in the carrying
out of their planning functions.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has similar responsibilities in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Minister of Health and Local Government is responsible
for housing and planning.
The Ministry of Works acts as production authority in Great Britain for the building
industry. The agricultural departments are responsible for advising on the agricultural
value of land proposed for housing or other development. The Board of Trade is
responsible for regulating the distribution of industrial development. An inter¬
departmental committee on the Services’ land requirements meets to harmonise
Service and civilian needs and proposals for land use.
HOUSING
While responsibility for housing policy and for the general execution of the housing
programme rests with the minister, local authorities are responsible for housing in their
areas to the extent that they must ensure as far as possible that housing conditions
are satisfactory, see that adequate standards are maintained in newly built and existing
houses, and submit plans for the clearance of unfit dwellings, and for new provision
where required. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the local housing
authorities are the councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan
boroughs), urban districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the
Common Council of the City of London. In Scotland, all town and county councils
are housing authorities.
178
HOUSING AND PLANNING
179
There are in all about 16^ million houses in the United Kingdom: over 14 million in
England and Wales, 1,600,000 in Scotland, and about 400,000 in Northern Ireland.
About 3! million of the houses in England and Wales and over half a million
houses in Scotland are owned by local authorities, that is, in all, about 1 house in 4.
Over 5 million houses, about 1 house in 3, are in owner-occupation; most of the
remainder (mainly older houses) are rented from private landlords.
Private enterprise is responsible for about half the houses and flats now being built,1
but local authorities (that is, for the most part, private builders under contract to
local authorities) built about 70 per cent of the 3! million houses completed between
1945 and the end of 1959. While resources were still very limited, following the second
world war, and the demand for houses urgent and widespread, local authorities were
given the greater share of the programme. Quantitative restrictions on private building
were, however, gradually removed from the beginning of 1952, and finally abolished in
November 1954. Building reached a peak in 1954, at 354,129 houses or flats completed
during the year. The total number built in 1959 was 281,568.
The initial capital cost of houses built by or for local authorities is met by raising
loans; current expenditure, including loan repayment and interest on loans, is met
from rents, rates and, where available, Exchequer subsidies. Local authorities may
raise loans for housing either in the open market or, where borrowing from private
sources cannot be effected at normal rates of interest, by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board.
Funds for houses built by private enterprise are obtained mainly by borrowing.
The chief agencies concerned in lending money are the building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
The main emphasis in local authority housing is now on slum clearance and on
housing specially suited to old people, although shortage of housing, particularly of
unfurnished accommodation for renting, is still a problem in some areas, notably in
London, Glasgow, and some other large conurbations. Nevertheless, since 1951 over
7 million people have been rehoused. In selecting their tenants local authorities are
required to give preference to families living in overcrowded or otherwise unsatisfactory
housing conditions.
New Building
The agencies for building houses in Britain are private builders, local authorities,
new towns development corporations, certain Government departments which need
to house the families of the armed forces or other Services, and housing associations,
which are non-profit-making bodies providing houses mostly for letting rather than
for sale. There have also been self-help groups whose members, in their spare time,
build houses to be occupied by group members; some of these groups are organised as
housing associations.
Local authority houses are normally built for letting, and privately built houses
for owner-occupation.
The central departments have issued manuals of guidance setting standards of
space, structure, design and equipment for different types of houses and flats provided
1 These proportions relate to Great Britain as a whole. In Scotland the proportion of private
building to local authority building is lower than in England and Wales. Out of a total of 37,293
dwellings built in Scotland in 1959, 4,232 (about 15 per cent) were for private owners.
In Northern Ireland, in the three years 1957-59, out of a total of 16,332 new houses, 6,861
were built for private owners.

by public agencies, and describing how estates can be laid out attractively while saving
land and money, by the use of new and improved types of layout.
A number of new forms of construction for permanent houses have been developed
with practical encouragement from the Government during the experimental stage.
The typical family house is designed for a household of four or five persons, and
contains one or two living-rooms and a kitchen, a store, a bathroom and water closet,
and two or three bedrooms. To provide for the growing numbers of old people, though
a great deal remains to be done, a much higher proportion of smaller dwellings has been
built in recent years, in response to the encouragements of the Government’s policy;
the percentage of local authority one-bedroom dwellings has risen from 7 per cent
in 1951 to 22 per cent in 1959 in England and Wales and from 2-4 per cent to 15-4
per cent in Scotland.
The majority of new dwellings are houses (usually of two storeys) or bungalows;
the remainder are flats or maisonettes in blocks of from 2 to 13, and sometimes 19,
storeys. Most of the high blocks are built in central areas of cities, where densely
populated old, unfit houses are being replaced. Others are in the new towns and other
areas of new housing where they counterbalance smaller-scale buildings to provide
a variety of types of accommodation at a moderate overall density.
The typical 3-bedroom house built by a local authority in England and Wales in
1959 had a superficial area of just over 900 square feet and cost under £1,880 to provide.
Slum Clearance
Returns made by local housing authorities in 1955 indicated that there were about
one million slum dwellings in Great Britain which ought to be cleared. In England
and Wales, about 850,000, or 6-5 per cent of all houses, and in Scotland over 150,000,
about 10 per cent, were estimated to be unfit for human habitation and due for demoli¬
tion. In Northern Ireland, the number of such houses was estimated in 1958 at
about 50,000.
In the four years 1956 to 1959, local authorities in England and Wales demolished
or closed 198,287 unfit houses, involving 589,192 occupants; while in Scotland, 35,687
houses were demolished or closed during the same period. In Northern Ireland 498
dwellings were demolished and 668 closed in the two-year period 1958-59.
At the present rate of progress, many local authorities will have completed their
programmes by the end of i960 or soon after; in some of the larger industrial towns,
however, where there are a great number of small, obsolete dwellings, mostly dating
from the nineteenth century, completion will necessarily take much longer.
To help in those areas of Great Britain where the number of slum houses is so
large that it would not be practicable to replace all of them within the next few years,
local authorities can acquire houses unfit for human habitation and ‘patch’ them in
order that they may be occupied for a strictly limited period pending their demolition.
The intention is that these houses should be demolished as soon as possible: the
temporary repairs are not intended as an alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer
contributions are available to meet part of the costs of acquisition and essential repairs.
Housing authorities are under a statutory obligation to see that other accommodation
exists, or can be provided by them, for persons to be displaced from slum clearance
areas. Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the owner
retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. But if the local authorities
acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves and to rebuild on the land,
the normal basis of compensation is the market value of the house as it stands or
the value of the site after clearance, whichever is the less. In England and Wales
HOUSING AND PLANNING
181
there are, however, special provisions for owner-occupiers who bought between 1939
and 1955, and they receive full compensation regardless of whether the house is being
acquired by the authority or not; similar terms apply to business occupiers. The slum
clearance code also provides for special payments for the good maintenance of unfit
houses and business occupiers may receive hardship payments in certain cases.
An Exchequer subsidy is payable to the local authority for every dwelling built
because a family displaced from an unfit house is rehoused by the authority.
House Purchase Loans
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance companies,
industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Building societies are the most important of these agencies. They do not themselves,
build houses; their chief activity is providing long-term loans on the security of houses
bought for owner-occupation, whether newly built or older houses, or houses under
construction. Loans are usually repayable over periods of 20 or even 30 years, by equal
monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The societies’ funds are derived
mainly from investment of relatively modest sums by the general public.
Many local authorities also operate a scheme whereby, for a house costing up to
£2,500, they guarantee part of the loan made by a building society so that an advance'
greater than normal (up to 95 per cent of the value of the house in some cases) may be
made to the purchaser. The Exchequer undertakes to share any liability local authorities
may incur under this scheme.
Under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, the Government can advance
money to building societies for re-lending to prospective purchasers of older houses.
Loans can be made available to enable designated building societies who have joined
the Government scheme to advance up to 95 per cent of the value of a private house
bought for owner-occupation, where it was built before 1st January, 1919, and does-
not exceed £2,500 in value (or £3,000 in London). Building societies were already
lending some £40 million to £50 million a year for the purchase of pre-1919 houses,
in addition to some £330 million a year for newer houses; Exchequer loans for the
purchase of older houses should, therefore, enable the societies to lend more for
newer houses also; and societies which have joined the scheme undertake to make
advances of 95 per cent on houses built between the wars.
Local authorities have power to make loans under the Housing Acts for the
acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration of houses. Under the
House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, they may now make loans of up to 100 per
cent of the house’s value, and there is no longer any restriction upon the value of houses
that can attract loans. (There is still a limit of £5,000 for loans made by local authorities,
under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, but authorities make wider use of the
more flexible alternative provisions in the Housing Acts.)
Building Subsidies and Improvement Grants
Housing subsidies, at varying rates and for varying purposes, have been provided
in Britain since 1919, when they were first introduced to facilitate the building of
houses for letting at moderate rents.
After the second world war, subsidies at higher rates, payable annually for 60
years from the year of building completion, were provided for all new housing accom¬
modation built with ministerial approval by the local authorities, by new towns-
development corporations, or by housing associations under arrangements with,
local authorities.
182
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales, a standard rate of subsidy was paid for ordinary houses or
flats built to meet general needs, and higher rates of subsidy were provided for certain
types of housing (e.g., high blocks of flats on expensive sites), housing built for parti¬
cular purposes (e.g., for the agricultural population) and housing in special areas
(e.g., poor areas of low rate-paying capacity). While the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956,
provided an extended range of subsidies for special categories of housing, it reduced,
and provided for the abolition of, the standard subsidy on dwellings built for general
needs. This subsidy was abolished as from November 1956, except for one-bedroom
dwellings, on which it was retained to encourage the provision of accommodation for
elderly and single persons.
Legislation on subsidies for new housing in England and Wales is now consolidated
in the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. The categories of new building by
public bodies for which subsidies are available are: dwellings built for the purpose of
slum clearance rehousing, or for rehousing persons in unsatisfactory temporary
accommodation {£22 is. per dwelling per year); housing for the population moved
out of a congested area (e.g., to a new town or as part of an approved scheme of town
development) or moving to meet the urgent needs of industry (£24 per year); dwellings
otherwise unsubsidised with not more than one bedroom {£10 per year); housing
provided to meet the needs of the agricultural population; housing on expensive sites,
or where measures have to be taken against subsidence, or to preserve the character
of the surroundings; and housing in areas where more accommodation is urgently
required than could be provided by the local authority without imposing an unreason¬
ably heavy burden on the local rates or necessitating the charging of unreasonably high
rents. On flats, higher rates of subsidy are paid for blocks of four or more storeys. There
is also a subsidy available to private persons building houses for agricultural workers.
Local authorities and private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer
assistance for the improvement of existing houses or adaptation of buildings for hous¬
ing. Cash grants can be made by local authorities, with Exchequer assistance, to persons
converting or improving existing buildings for housing at a cost of over £100 per
dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost, \vith a maximum grant of £400 for
each dwelling thus provided. There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings
as improved or converted must fulfil, to ensure that public money is only spent on
property that will provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficiently long period.
Grants for similar work in houses owned by local authorities may also be paid by the
minister, but on an annual basis over 20 years. In either case, the payment of grant is
at the discretion of the local authority, or the minister, as the case may be. Local
housing authorities are however obliged to make grants called ‘standard grants’, for
the provision in houses of a bath in a bathroom, hot-water supply, water closet, wash
basin, and food store; these cash grants are to cover half the cost of the work, subject
to a maximum grant of £155 or smaller sums if not all of the five items are needed.
Similarly the minister is obliged to make standard grants to local authorities, but again
on an annual basis over 20 years. The Acts under which these improvement grants are
now available are the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, and the House Purchase
and Housing Act, 1959.
Building subsidies and improvement grants are also provided in Scotland and
Northern Ireland; the amounts of subsidy are generally higher owing to higher costs
and different circumstances. In Scotland, there is a subsidy of £24 per house per year
for houses built by public authorities to meet general needs, with higher rates of
subsidy for those for special needs (e.g., overspill, incoming industry, agricultural
workers). Grants are also available to local authorities and private owners for the

improvement or conversion of existing properties, and to private owners for the
provision of new houses for farm workers. In Northern Ireland, annual subsidies are
paid to local authorities, the Northern Ireland Housing Trust1 and housing associations;
in addition, lump sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons who build houses for
letting or for owner-occupation. Grants are available for the provision of new houses
and for the reconditioning of existing premises to accommodate farmers and
approved workers.
The average annual cost of housing subsidies in the United Kingdom has been over
£100 million since 1954, some three-quarters of the total being paid by the Exchequer
and about a quarter by local authorities.
Control of Rents
The majority of the privately owned houses in Great Britain which are let are
subject to rent control. Houses owned by local authorities, new towns development
corporations, housing associations, and the Scottish Special Housing Association are,
in general, free from control, as are new houses completed since 30th August, 1954.
Since the autumn of 1956* the Government has pursued a policy of progressive
abolition of rent control on the grounds that the previous system was leading to
deterioration and wasteful use of the nation’s stock of housing.
The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed in i9I5* The Acts now in force, either
wholly or in part, are the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1920 to
I939> the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act, 1949, the Housing Repairs and
Rents Acts, 1954, the Rent Act, 1957, and the Landlord and Tenant (Temporary
Provisions) Act, 1958.
The Rent Restrictions Acts, which, before 6th July, i957> applied with few exceptions
to all privately owned unfurnished dwellings below a certain rateable value, limited
the rent a landlord might legally recover from the tenant, while at the same time
giving the tenant security of tenure. The Acts also made illegal most premiums for the
grant of a tenancy of rent-controlled premises. Landlords restricted in this way were
themselves protected against an increase in mortgage interest rates and the calling in of
the mortgage, provided they paid the restricted interest due. The Housing Repairs
and Rents Acts, i954> allowed landlords to increase their rents to pay for repairs,
subject to certain conditions and to a maximum limit.
The Rent Act, 1957, amended the Rent Restrictions Acts and the Repairs and Rents
Acts of 1954. It established, for the houses remaining in control in England and Wales,
revised rent limits more in keeping with the current value of money and the cost of
maintenance, and permitted in Scotland increases in controlled rents subject to certain
conditions. It provided that new unfurnished lettings should be free of control,
both in the 4! million houses in owner-occupation when the Act was passed which,
previously, if let unfurnished, would have been subject to rent control, and in con¬
trolled houses which should fall vacant and be re-let. In addition, over 800,000 houses
let at controlled rents were released from control by the lowering of the limits of rate¬
able value below which rented houses are subject to control.2 The Act provided for the
de-control from time to time of further categories of houses by order, subject to
approval by Parliament. Certain exceptions and safeguards for the protection of

tenants were provided under the Act, and tenants of properties released from control
by the lowering of the control limits were given further temporary protection by the
Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1958, which expires on 31st July,
1961.
For England and Wales, the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act, 1946, established
rent tribunals to determine the rents of houses or parts of houses let furnished or with
services, in cases referred to them by the lessor, the lessee or by the local authority.
Similar legislation for determining rents of furnished lettings was passed for Scotland
in 1943. The Rent Act, 1957, provided that, if the premises when let unfurnished
would be above the rateable value limits for control, they should not if let furnished
come within the scope of the Act of 1946. The Landlord and Tenant (Furniture and
Fittings) Act, 1959, made it an offence to offer furniture and fittings at an excessive
price as a condition of tenancy, and to fail to provide an inventory specifying the price
asked for each item to people supplied with particulars of the tenancy.
Somewhat similar measures of control and de-control apply in Northern Ireland.
In 1951, legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of |
controlled houses, provided that they were maintained in good repair; and the Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amendment) Act (Northern
Ireland), 1956, permitted an increase of one-third in the rent levels fixed by the
1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred expenditure of a certain amount
on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from control houses with a net annual value
of over £50 (with certain safeguards) and houses with a net annual value of over
^26 of which the landlord was in actual possession when the Act came into force,
or of which he subsequently obtained possession.
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
The land of Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it
is therefore of vital importance in the public interest that competing claims to its use
should be settled in such a way that the necessary balance between them is maintained.
From 1909 onwards, the idea of the planned use of land was given a degree of
expression in successive Acts of Parliament, but because the pattern of development
over much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban con¬
centrations (as a result of the industrialisation processes of the previous century) the
powers granted to planning authorities by the early Acts were inadequate for the task
in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were decades of expansion in industry,
engineering and house-building; population was increasing, and there was a general
movement towards better standards of living, and consequently a greater need for
systematic planning than had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the nineteen-
thirties, a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen planning law and to
extend the planning powers of central and local authorities to the point at which they
could exercise effective control. Despite this effort, which culminated in the Town and
Country Planning Act, 1932, inter-war planning legislation had only a limited effect,
mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the question of compensation, which
had always been an obstacle to satisfactory planning. By the nineteen-twenties, it had
become generally accepted that the property of an individual might be subjected to
restrictions in the public interest, provided that just and due compensation (out of ,
public funds) were paid. In theory, such payments should, to some extent, have been
balanced by revenue from betterment charges (i.e. charges payable by those whose
property had been enhanced in value by development), but, in practice, such charges
HOUSING AND PLANNING
i85
proved almost impossible either to determine or to collect. As a result, local authorities
often hesitated to acquire land necessary for development for fear of being involved in
compensation liabilities beyond their means; and, therefore, in spite of improved
sanitary and environmental conditions and some progress in preserving amenities,
many of the outstanding problems of land use remained unsolved.
Renewed efforts were made to deal with these problems immediately before and
during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert committees were
appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth and spread of industry,
(2) the hampering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of
compensation and betterment and (3) the encroachment of urban development upon
the countryside. After the war, other committees studied the question of new towns
and national parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees have now
been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the Distribution of Industry
Acts, 1945 and 195°; ^e New Towns Acts, 1946 and 1959; the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1947 to 1959; the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act,
1949; the Town Development Act, 1952; and the Housing and Town Development
(Scotland) Act, 1957. Town and country planning in Northern Ireland is governed
by the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931; the Planning (Interim
Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 19445 an(^ the Planning Acts Amendment
Act (Northern Ireland), 1944.
Planning in Great Britain
The pattern of land use in Great Britain is governed by the Town and Country
Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947,
which are the principal Acts and provide for (1) the co-ordination of planning by
means of development plans drawn up by local planning authorities and approved
by the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and (2) the control of development by making it subject, generally, to
the permission of a local planning authority or of a central Government depart¬
ment. The Acts also give extensive powers to public authorities to acquire and develop
land for planning purposes, provide for grants from public funds towards the cost of
schemes of major redevelopment, and deal with certain questions of amenity, e.g., the
preservation of buildings of special historic or architectural interest, and of trees and
woodlands, and the control of advertisement display.
Compensation for loss of development value through the refusal of planning
permission is paid by the Government according to a formula laid down in the 1954
Town and Country Planning Acts. Compensation to owners whose land is compul¬
sorily purchased is paid by the acquiring authorities, the amount being based (under
the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1959) on the price the land might have fetched
if sold in the open market, with safeguards for local authorities against paying for
value brought about by their own activities and for owners against depreciation which
the threat of public acquisition might cause. In general, expenditure on planning
purposes (other than schemes of major redevelopment) is taken into account in the
amount of the general grant paid to local authorities under the Local Government
Act, 1958, and the Local Government and Miscellaneous Financial Provisions
(Scotland) Act, 1958.
Development Plans
Local planning authorities (in England and Wales, the councils of counties and
county boroughs and, in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland, councils
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
186
of counties and of large burghs, and the councils of the two small burghs of St. Andrews
and Thurso) are required to prepare and submit development plans covering the whole
of their areas to the Minister of Housing and Local Government and to the Secretary
of State for Scotland respectively. Each development plan is expressed by an authorita¬
tive written statement describing the major projects in the plan, supplemented by a
series of maps based on a survey of the physical and other resources of the area. Fresh
surveys must be carried out every five years and plans may be extended and altered
at any time, so that they may be kept up to date. Local authorities must advertise their
plans when they submit them for approval, and the ministers concerned must consider
objections and representations from the public and, when necessary, arrange for
local inquiries to be held. Once a plan has been approved, it cannot be challenged
except on the grounds that it is ultra vires or that statutory requirements have not
been fulfilled.
All the planning authorities in England and Wales had submitted their plans by
1957, and by the beginning of i960, 142 plans had been approved. By the latter date,
47 of the 57 local planning authorities in Scotland had submitted plans or part-plans; |
28 of them had received approval to whole plans and 7 to part-plans. Several authorities
in both countries had also submitted amendments and additions to their original
plans. During recent years, emphasis has been placed increasingly upon the need to
preserve open country round large towns, and in a number of approved development
plans, proposals for the maintenance or extension of green belts have been incorporated.
Planning authorities have also been encouraged to provide more land for development
beyond green belts and to make more extensive use of land within existing towns.
The Distribution of Industry
The Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, and the Local Employment Act, i960,
contain provisions to control the location of industry throughout the country. General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of Government
departments, but the main responsibility for controlling the siting of industry as apart
from its general location rests with the local planning authorities, for it is their duty,
subject to the consent of the Board of Trade, to ensure that industrial development
fits properly into existing and expanding communities and is consistent with the best
use of land.
New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Minister of Plousing and Local Govern¬
ment and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are the responsible ministers,
powers to make an order designating any area of land (which may include as its
nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a proposed new town, after con¬
sultation with the local authorities concerned and if it is in the public interest to
do so. Once the site has been designated, the responsible minister appoints a develop¬
ment corporation (consisting of a chairman and up to eight other members) to be
responsible for the development of the new town. A master plan is then prepared, and
this becomes the basis for development proposals, each of which covers a part of the area.
Every proposal is submitted to the responsible minister, who must consult the local
planning authority and, together with the Treasury, be satisfied with the proposal
on economic grounds before giving approval.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland)
HOUSING AND PLANNING
l87
to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property in the designated
areas which is necessary for their purposes, and they may provide housing, commercial
and industrial premises, estate roads and other buildings or services essential for the
development of the towns. In England and Wales, the Minister of Housing and Local
Government has made a special development order to exempt the development
corporations from having to obtain planning permission from the local planning
authorities; in Scotland, this exemption does not apply.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations from
public funds and must be repaid on terms approved by the ministers with the con¬
currence of the Treasury. The corporations must submit annual reports (which must
include copies of their audited accounts) to the Minister of Housing and Local
Government or to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are responsible for laying
them before Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed (a point which
has almost been reached in some towns), the development corporation will be dissolved
and, under the terms of the New Towns Act, 1959, its assets and liabilities will be
handed over to a central agency—the Commission for New Towns. The commission,
which will operate during the period of new town consolidation, will consist of not
more than fifteen members, appointed by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, and it will be responsible for maintaining and enhancing the value of the land
entrusted to it with due regard to the purpose for which the towns were developed
and the convenience and welfare of the people working there. No new towns commission
is proposed for Scotland, where new town development is at a less advanced stage.
There are fifteen new towns in Great Britain—twelve in England and Wales and
three in Scotland. Eight of the new towns in England and Wales—Basildon and
Harlow in Essex; Kernel Hempstead, Stevenage, Hatfield and Welwyn in
Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in Berkshire—are designed to
help in absorbing excess population from the Greater London area; four others—
Corby in Northamptonshire; Aycliffe and Peterlee in Durham; and Cwmbran in
Monmouthshire—are to serve the special needs of their areas. The Scottish new towns
—East Kilbride in Lanarkshire, Glenrothes in Fife and Cumbernauld in Dunbarton¬
shire—are being established to assist in housing the surplus population from Glasgow.
The new towns are generally recognised as one of the most successful experiments
of the post-war years, industrially, financially and socially, and they represent a
notable achievement in the translation of planning into reality. By the end of June
i960, the total population of the new towns in England and Wales, designed to be
550,000 when the towns are completed, had reached an estimated total of 406,600
(including the people previously living in the area); 77,407 houses had been built
by the development corporations, and a further 9,204 were under construction;
375 factories had been established and a further 30 were being erected; 1,774 shops
had been completed, and 148 more were being built; 147 schools had been finished
and 18 more were under construction. Considerable progress had been made in the
construction of the town centres of most of the towns; many miles of roads had been
laid; large main sewerage works had kept pace with industrial and domestic needs;
an increasing number of police, fire and bus stations and services had been provided;
and sites had been reserved in the town centres for municipal buildings of all kinds.
Sites had also been reserved for general hospitals, on three of which building had
already begun.
In addition, some advance had been made in the provision of permanent com¬
munity buildings and other communal amenities, which is the responsibility of the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
188
local authorities of the towns. Approximate overall figures for certain amenities,
including temporary buildings and some which are adequate for limited use only,
are (in England and Wales): 227 halls for hire; 34 community centres; 84 churches
and church halls; 31 public libraries; 29 health centres and clinics; and 49 public
houses.
In the Scottish new towns, at the end of June i960, the population, eventually to
be 130,000, had reached an estimated figure of just over 48,000; 10,470 houses had
been built, with a further 1,950 under construction; 28 factories had been established
and a further 6 were being built; 122 shops had been completed and 20 were under
construction; 14 new schools were in use, and the extension of communications,
public services and communal amenities was under way.
Under the New Towns Act of 1946, Parliament approved a consolidated fund
of £50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations for work
on the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts and, under the 1959
Act, stood at £400 million.
Town Development Schemes and War-damaged Cities
The Town Development Act, 1952, makes provision for the relief of congestion in
large industrial towns by encouraging the transfer of population and industry to
appropriate country districts in England and Wales. By the end of 1959, as a result
of a series of agreements between local authorities, some 7,000 houses had been built
or were under construction (with a further 23,000 projected) in the expanding towns
to take population from London, and some 9,000 (with a further 25,000 projected) for
overspill from large provincial cities. By the same date, 71 firms had built, or were
building, factories covering over 2 million square feet in the expanding towns. The
Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957, makes similar provisions
for central Scotland.
Individual plans for the reconstruction of areas of extensive war damage have
also been drawn up and approved and the central areas of several provincial cities,
e.g., Bristol, Coventry, Exeter, Kingston upon Hull, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and
Southampton, have been almost entirely rebuilt. In the county of London, building is
going on at the rate of fourteen acres a week, and ten square miles of the area have been
rebuilt during the last nine years, while in the City of London, projects valued at
more than £58^ million had been completed by the end of June i960. The redevelop¬
ment of outworn and obsolete areas is also taking place in many towns: Glasgow, for
example, has started a programme of rebuilding 29 areas, housing nearly a third of the
population and accommodating much of the industry and commerce of the city.
National Parks and Access to the Countryside
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided for the
designation of a number of extensive areas of beautiful country in England and
Wales as national parks. In these areas the characteristic landscape is to be carefully
preserved, and facilities for open-air recreation may be provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and by April 1957 its work
had resulted in the establishment of ten of the twelve national parks recommended
by the National Parks (England and Wales) Committee, which reported in 1947.
Of the other two, the Broads (Norfolk) were still under consideration in June i960,
and the South Downs will not become a national park. The established parks are:
the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia in North Wales, Dartmoor in Devon,
the Pembrokeshire Coast, the North York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor in
HOUSING AND PLANNING
189
Devon and Somerset, Northumberland (comprising most of the upland country from
the Cheviots in the north to the Roman Wall in the south), and the Brecon Beacons
in South Wales. These parks cover a total area of 5,254 square miles, almost one-
eleventh of the area of England and Wales. The administrative arrangements for the
parks are as follows: the Peak District and Lake District National Parks are
administered by joint planning boards; for Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the
North York Moors and Northumberland, special park planning committees of the
respective county councils have been set up; while in Snowdonia, the Yorkshire
Dales, Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons (which include areas of more than one county
council) there are park planning committees representative of each of the constituent
county councils, advised by a park joint advisory committee. All these authorities
control development in the parks and take such positive action as they deem necessary
to enhance their natural beauty and to promote enjoyment of them by the public.
As a result, derelict land is reclaimed, unsightly structures are removed, new building
is made to harmonise with the natural surroundings, advertisement displays are reduced,
and car parks and camping sites are provided in suitable localities. Government grants
at the rate of 75 per cent are available towards certain approved expenditure on
improvements.
The National Parks Commission has power to designate other areas in England and
Wales as ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ in order to keep them unspoiled. By
the end of June i960, eleven of these areas had been established and a further eight
were under consideration. Those established are Gower, Quantock Hills, Lleyn,
Northumberland Coast, Surrey Hills, Cannock Chase, Shropshire Hills, Dorset,
Malvern Hills, North Devon coast and parts of Cornwall. In these areas government
grants are available only for certain measures taken to enhance natural beauty.
Designation of a park or ‘area’ does not, of itself, mean that the general public has
right of access. Local planning authorities have been given the task of surveying
the extent to which land in their areas is already open to the public, and are empowered
to increase it, where desirable, by means of agreements with owners or by access
orders. In National Parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, government
grants are available towards the cost of making such agreements or orders and in the
Peak District large tracts of country have been opened to the public in this way.
A complete survey of all footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales is also
being made as a comprehensive national record of public rights of way; and in some
areas existing footpaths and bridleways are being linked to form long-distance routes,
which will become continuous rights of way for travellers on foot or on horseback.
By the end of June i960, all county councils had prepared draft maps of rights of way
for the whole of their areas, based on individual surveys of footpaths carried out by
parish and county district councils. Responsibility for making proposals for long¬
distance routes rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals are
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, it falls to the local
authorities to give effect to them. By the end of June i960, the National Parks Commis¬
sion’s proposals for the creation of six routes, covering 929 miles, had been approved;
progress had been made by means of surveys, cairn building and footpath agreements,
towards their completion; and discussions were taking place between the commission
and the relevant local authorities regarding the establishment of more routes of this kind.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has formed, and opened to the public, seven National
Forest Parks in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool, Glen More, and Loch Ard (renamed
190
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park to commemorate the Coronation) in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean in England; Snowdonia in Wales and the Border Forest Park (adjoining
the Northumberland National Park to the westward), which includes forests on the
borders of Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh in Scotland.
The total area of the seven parks is rather less than half a million acres, including
planted areas and unplantable moorland and mountains. Camping facilities are provided
in most of the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a National Forest Park, is
also open to the public.
Nature Conservation
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy,
which derives the necessary powers for the proper discharge of its functions from the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949. The object of conservation,
which is to influence soils, water, vegetation and animal life, by means of research,
experiment and control, entails the acquisition and management of a representative
series of reserves, as well as the establishment of laboratories for use in long-term
research schemes and the making of grants-in-aid for specified research.
Eighty-two nature reserves, 36 of which have already had comprehensive manage¬
ment plans prepared for them, had been declared in Great Britain by the end of June
i960. The combined area was 138,437 acres, of which 39,639 acres comprise the
Cairngorms, the largest reserve in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. Seven other
areas (mostly in the north) are managed by local authorities, using their powers under
the National Parks Act, in consultation with the conservancy.
Eight forest nature reserves have been set up; of these, seven have been created by
agreement between the Forestry Commission and the Nature Conservancy and consist
of forest land managed under joint supervision in the interests of nature conservancy
and forestry. A similar arrangement has been made with the Crown Estate Commis¬
sioners, by which a 45-acre area is being managed in the interests of nature conservation
and ecological research.
The unofficial and voluntary counterpart of the Nature Conservancy is the Council
for Nature, established in 1958 on the initiative of the Society for the Promotion of
Nature Reserves. The council represents the interests of both national and local
natural history societies (at present over 230 such societies are members) and the
importance of its work has been recognised by the receipt of substantial grants from
the Ministry of Education, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Carnegie
United Kingdom Trust. The council’s Conservation Corps consists of young people
who carry out practical tasks of nature reserve management, such as the clearance of
scrub and the opening up of blocked waterways. Its Intelligence Unit acts as an infor¬
mation bureau on all aspects of natural history in the British Isles, issues a monthly
press bulletin of natural history news, and edits the council’s half-yearly bulletin,
News for Naturalists. The unit’s Films Officer organises training courses for amateur
cinematographers interested in making natural history films.
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural beauties
of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and Local Government,
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the various statutory planning authorities
and commissions. The Ministry of Works is also concerned as the department respons¬
ible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces, for the protection of ancient
HOUSING AND PLANNING
191
monuments (under the Ancient Monuments Acts), and for making grants (on the
recommendation of the appropriate Historic Buildings Council) for the repair and
maintenance of buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest or their
contents and for the upkeep of adjoining land. About 600 of the 10,000 most important
protected monuments listed in Britain (ranging from prehistoric remains to nineteenth
century buildings) are in the care of the ministry; and, by the end of June i960,
grants totalling nearly £3 million had been offered and accepted towards the cost of
urgently needed repairs to 713 historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their members,
include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded in 1926 to
organise concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery and of town and
country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association for the Preservation
of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural scenery and of the
amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland; the Commons,
Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the
Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust; the National Trust
for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland; and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust for England, Wales
and Northern Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and by i960 had some 91,000
members) is (apart from the Crown) the largest land-owner in the United Kingdom.
It has acquired, mainly through gifts, over a thousand properties, which it holds for the
enjoyment of the public; it administers more than 250,000 acres of land of great
natural beauty; and it owns many fine gardens. The National Trust for Scotland, an
independent body, founded in 1931 to promote the preservation of places of historic
or architectural interest or of natural beauty in Scotland for the benefit of the public,
now has about 15,000 members and has under its care some 60 properties, covering in
all over 70,000 acres.
Planning in Northern Ireland
The Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, which is the main source
from which power to prepare a planning scheme is derived, provides for the preparation
by local authorities of planning schemes for development or redevelopment of their
areas, with the general object of securing proper sanitary conditions and amenities
in connection with the laying out and use of land. The Interim Development Act of
1944 enables persons wishing to carry out development to do so without delay, while
ensuring that such development shall conform to the provisions likely to be included
in the planning scheme for the area.
The provisions of the Acts brought all land in Northern Ireland under planning
control and required every local authority to prepare a planning scheme for its area.
Interim control is exercised in accordance with the section of the 1944 Act which
requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission to develop,
the authority may grant the application conditionally or unconditionally or may
refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or conditional approval, the applicant
has a right to appeal to the Ministry of Health and Local Government for Northern
Ireland (which is the department primarily responsible for the administration of
the planning Acts) or to an independent person appointed by the ministry.
All local planning authorities in Northern Ireland have made appreciable progress
in the preparation of outline plans which indicate broadly the proposals for their areas,
thus providing a foundation for the preparation of more detailed plans at a later stage
and facilitating materially the work of interim development control. Many interim
igz
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
development applications have been decided by local planning authorities, and appeals
lodged with the ministry have been relatively few.
Northern Ireland Forest Park
Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle, County Down,
was opened to the public in 1955. Situated at the foot of the Mountains of Mourne,
it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum comprising a wide variety
of native and exotic trees, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland scenery. Caravan
facilities and a camping site for youth organisations are available.
VII. THE CHURCHES
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as described
in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he may change his
religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching, worship and observance
without interference from the community or the State. Churches and religious societies
of all kinds may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech
and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from the seven¬
teenth century onwards; in many cases, relaxation in the administration of laws
discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the repeal of the legislation
concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with the passing of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act, 1677, and the Toleration Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship
to Protestant dissenters. In 1828, the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed
nonconformists from political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed
to public offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act, 1829; the Jewish Relief Act, 1858, enabled Jews to become members
of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on prospective students
and members of the academic staff of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and
Durham were successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871. Nowadays, there
is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public office, except that the
Lord Chancellor may not be a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the national
hospitals, and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of England or the
Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and are paid a salary by the
State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman Catholic Church and ministers
of other denominations may also be appointed or specially called in as required.
Voluntary schools (see p. 158) provided by churches of any religious denomination
may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number of
adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries are
made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official returns, and each
church adopts different criteria in counting its members. The membership figures
given in the following sections should therefore be taken as approximate.
Church of England
The Church of England is the Established Church, and claims to be the ancient
catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth century, it repudiated
the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic episcopate, and the creeds and
sacraments upon which its doctrines are based; therefore it claims to be both ‘catholic’
and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer,
which was first compiled in 1549.
Relations with the State
No single Act of Parliament defines the position of the Church of England in the
way that the Treaty of Union, 1707, defines the position of the Church of Scotland.
I93
J94
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England, the relationship of Church and State is one of mutual obligation—
privileges accorded to the Church which are balanced by certain duties which it
must fulfil.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown, in that the Sovereign, who must be
a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’ (a statutory
title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or her accession to uphold it.
The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Primate of all England; prayers for the Sovereign and other members of the royal
family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church of England arch¬
bishops, bishops and other senior ecclesiastical dignitaries as well as incumbents of
Crown livings are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister;
and all clergymen take the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is further linked with the State through the House of Lords, in which
the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and the twenty-four senior diocesan
bishops have seats. This makes it possible for the views of the Church leaders to be
expressed freely on any moral issue raised in connection with the corporate conduct
of the State as well as on specifically ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular
significance in view of the fact that the clergy of the Church of England (together
with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic
Church) are legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament; canon laws (Church rules)
cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen in Council; and the
measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from their regulations) are not valid
without parliamentary assent.
Church Organisation and Government
The Church of England is organised by geographical areas, and not by congregations.
There are 43 dioceses (with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) each under
a bishop, grouped into two provinces, each under an archbishop: Canterbury (29
dioceses) and York (14 dioceses). The dioceses are sub-divided into ecclesiastical
parishes, of which there were 14,642 in 1958. Everyone in England is born in a parish,
and the parish church is expected to play an active part in local life. Many people
who do not attend its services regularly tend to look to it for such personal ministrations
as baptism, marriage and burial. The baptised membership of the Church is
about 27 million, i.e. 66 per cent of the population born and resident in the two
provinces.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative bodies
in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of Canterbury and
York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting of an upper house of
bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each cathedral chapter, archdeacons
and elected clergy. The Convocations meet not more often than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the National
Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the Church Assembly.
It was set up by the Crown in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations, and was
given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England Assembly (Powers)
Act of 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with the Church of England, but
may not make any doctrinal statements, nor infringe upon the rights of the
Convocations. It consists of three houses: bishops, clergy and laity. The first two
houses are composed of the members of the Convocations; the house of laity
THE CHURCHES
I95
consists of men and women elected every five years by the lay members of
diocesan conferences, and the constitution allows for ten co-opted members.
The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after passing
through vanous stages in the assembly, are presented to an ecclesiastical committee
of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members, of whom 15 are appointed
by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker of the House of Commons. This
committee lays the measures, together with a report upon them, before both Houses.
If both Houses so resolve, the measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent
after which it has the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though
it may reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting of
boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work, such as
education, training for the ministry, and Church work at home and overseas The
Church Assembly, through the Schools Council of its Board of Education, is responsible
for 8,000 Church of England schools of all types, for approximately half of which the
Church bears a quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils are
appointed by the parochial electors, i.e. persons who are baptised, are not members
of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have applied for membership
of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually reside or worship. The estimated
number on the parish electoral rolls in 1959 was just under three million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction, as
it is exercised today, consists almost entirely of faculty cases, with occasional cases
of discipline against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is
necessary for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church
or to a churchyard.
The Church has 26 church training colleges for teachers1 and 25 theological colleges.
Church Finance
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an annual
apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly contributes to the
Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority is the diocesan board
of finance, which administers the money contributed by the parishes, and acts as
trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils, which have only limited powers of
holding property. The Church Assembly Fund and various other central funds
(including that for the training of ordination candidates) are administered by the
Central Board of Finance of the Church of England. The State makes no payment
to the Church except for services rendered (e.g., chaplaincies to the armed forces and
in prisons).
The Church Commissioners, a body created by measure in 1947 to replace the
former Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Queen Anne’s Bounty, administers the
endowment income of the Church. It is largely responsible for the payment of stipends
of the clergy, and it also provides finance for pensions, new churches, parsonage
houses, and church schools. The total income from investments and all other sources
in the financial year 1958-9 was £13,217,000. The total annual income of the Church is
estimated to be approximately £35 million; no precise figure can be given.
1 "u Proframme of expansion of church training colleges, which included an increase in the
number of students from nearly 5,000 to nearly 8,000 and the building of a new college was
approved at the 1959 spring session of the Church Assembly.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
196
The Anglican Communion
The Anglican Communion comprises 17 autonomous churches in the United
Kingdom and overseas, with a total membership of over 40 million.
In the United Kingdom, in addition to the established Church of England, there
are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: the Church of
Ireland (disestablished in 1869) has 14 dioceses in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic, and some 354,000 members; the Episcopal Church in Scotland, 7 dioceses,
377 churches and some 108,000 members; and the Church in Whales (disestablished
in 1920), 6 dioceses and some 200,000 Easter communicants.
Outside the United Kingdom, the Anglican Communion exists wherever English¬
men have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant Episcopal Church
in the United States of America, the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon,
and the Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the
West Indies, China, Japan, West Africa and Central Africa are all autonomous
members of the Anglican Communion. In the Middle East, Jerusalem now has the
status of an archbishopric with jurisdiction over five dioceses in the region. A con¬
stitution has been agreed for a new province of East Africa, to include five dioceses in
Kenya and Tanganyika. In Uganda, a province is in process of formation which will
include seven or eight dioceses instead of the present two. In addition, there remain
nine overseas dioceses under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Terms
of limited intercommunion with the Church of South India, similar to those already
existing between that Church and the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon,
were laid down in resolutions passed by the Convocation of Canterbury in 1955.
Since 1867, the Lambeth Conference has met every tenth year (except for the
war years) as an unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; it is presided
over by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The last meeting, which was held in London
during July and August 1958, was attended by 310 bishops from all parts of the
Anglican Communion. The conference has no executive authority, but enjoys great
moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and on the attitude of the Anglican churches to political and social questions
are widely studied.
An executive officer of the Anglican Communion was appointed in 1960 to be the
executive officer of the Anglican advisory council on missionary strategy, and to exercise
general supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference
over all matters affecting the welfare of the Anglican Communion which call for
attention between the meetings of the conference.
The Church of Scotland
The established church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in government
is presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is
established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union, 1707, was
further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act, 1921.
Whereas in episcopacy, church government is a hierarchy of persons, in presby-
terianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal status, and each
of the 2,257 churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister
and elected elders (of whom there are over 44,000 in all): above this is the Court of
the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which
meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders presided over by an
elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has
THE CHURCHES
197
fought with the utmost vigour throughout the years for complete freedom in all
spiritual matters and for the right to appoint its own officers and to decide
all matters of doctrine and discipline. This freedom is recognised by Parliament, and
the decisions of the Church of Scotland are not subject to parliamentary debate or
modification.
The thorough training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given
the church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the standard
of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland in i960 was
estimated at 1,316,000.
The Free Churches
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’ churches;
and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established Church of Scotland),
Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches are the Methodist, Baptist
and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished presbyterian churches through¬
out Britain. In addition, there are a number of other protestant denominations in the
United Kingdom as well as such religious associations as the Society of Friends and
the Salvation Army, which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies and
practices of the established church. The Methodist Church, for example, originated
in the evangelical revival led by John Wesley within the Church of England
during the eighteenth century. More positively, the Free Churches would affirm
that the reason for their existence is a deep conviction about the nature of religious
worship.
The Methodist Churches
The largest of the Free Churches is the Methodist Church, formed in 1932 by
the union of the majority of independent Methodist Churches. It has some 740,000
adult full members. The supreme authority is the annual conference, and the system
of government is in many ways presbyterian: the leaders’ meeting corresponding
to the kirk sessions, with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery
and synod. One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are some 23,000 trained lay preachers sharing the ministers’ work
and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the Independent
Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary basis and women
(many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men; and the Wesleyan Reform
Union which, while retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives autonomy to
each of its 177 individual churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain. In
1831, most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union. Local
churches have formed county and national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies
have much influence, but no compulsive authority over them, since great importance
is attached to the autonomy of local church meetings. Adult membership is
approximately 212,000.
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped in associations
of churches, and the majority of these belong to the Baptist Union formed in 1813.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
198
Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they practise the baptism of believers
only; they do not baptise infants. The Baptist churches have a total of about 321,000
members.
The Unestablished Presbyterian Churches
The largest of the presbyterian churches outside the established Church of Scotland
is the Presbyterian Church in Ireland; in Ireland, there are 30 presbyteries (some of
which are situated in the Irish Republic) and the communicant membership is about
138,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose
from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in 1735, now includes a considerable
proportion of the Welsh-speaking population; its members number some 147,000.
The Presbyterian Church of England is organised in 14 presbyteries and has nearly
71,000 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women are admitted to the
eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church of Scotland;
the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church
of Ireland (which consists of 43 congregations and preaching stations, all but five
of which are in Northern Ireland); and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of
Ireland, comprising three presbyteries (two of which are in Northern Ireland), with
34 congregations.
Other Denominations
Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the Unitarian
and Free Christian Churches, which number about 300, with a membership of some
20,000; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of America as Disciples
of Christ) which have been an organised community in Britain since early in the
nineteenth century, and now have 165 churches in the United Kingdom, and a
membership of about 8,500; the British Province of the Moravian Church, which is
an international missionary church, with 40 congregations and preaching stations
in the United Kingdom and some 2,800 communicant members; the Free Church
of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct
result of the Oxford Movement, and now has 50 churches; the Society of Friends;
and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, was founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century by George Fox. It has no ordained ministry and does not observe the
sacraments. One of the chief characteristics of the Quakers is their belief in pacifism
and their firm adherence to pacifist methods. Their influence in many parts of the
world, especially in social reform and in the relief of suffering, is very wide in relation
to their numbers. There are about 21,600 Quakers in Britain; they have about 440
places of worship.
The Salvation Army, founded in 1878 by a Methodist, William Booth, is a religious
movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual and social betterment
of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to those hitherto untouched by
religious effort. The movement, in which military rather than ecclesiastical terminology
is used, has branches all over the world, and its social work (particularly that connected
with the welfare of members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well
supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other churchy
have about 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.
THE CHURCHES
199
The Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became temporarily
extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish hierarchy
became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in 1878, while the
Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct. The normal government of the
Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial archbishops and bishops, is once
again the rule in the whole of the United Kingdom.
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation is the
province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an archbishop. The
chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is the Archbishop of West¬
minster. A province normally comprises several dioceses, each under a bishop aided
by a chapter of canons and others, and by priests in charge of the parishes into which
the diocese is sub-divided. In England and Wales, there are four provinces and
archdioceses (Westminster, Liverpool, Birmingham and Cardiff), 14 dioceses, and
2,214 parishes; in Scotland, there are two provinces and archdioceses (St. Andrews
and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and 386 parishes; in Northern Ireland,
there are six dioceses (several of which have territory partly in the Irish Republic
and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one hierarchy for the whole of Ireland)
and about 172 parishes. In the whole of the United Kingdom, there are some four and
three-quarter million adherents (including children) to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of Roman
Catholic children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between Roman Catholics and members of any other Church should be brought up
as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in the United Kingdom
are staffed by members of the Religious Orders for men and women, who also undertake
other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jewry
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were expelled
at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The present Anglo-
Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being the Sephardi (from
Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth century an Ashkenazi community
(from Germany and East Europe) was established, which increased rapidly and spread
to the principal provincial cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish
communities on the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish
community of some 400,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought, each of
which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox (the original
groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches less religious
importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the Jewish faith, began
in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of the Liberal Jewish Move¬
ment which, in addition, lays emphasis on the reinterpretation of traditional Judaism
in the light of modern thought and custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain who belong
to any kind of synagogue, about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the
head of the largest group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head
of the Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain of all sections of Jewry number approximately 445, including
17 Liberal and 15 Reform congregations. There are a few schools which cater exclusively
for Jewish children, but the vast majority attend the ordinary State or independent
schools, and receive extra-curricular instruction in the Jewish faith.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Religious Communities
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and foreign
countries have established centres for worship for their own communities in the
United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian communities include
the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with some Estonian and Latvian
Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There are also churches belonging to
the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and
centres where Estonian, Latvian and Polish Lutherans worship according to their
creed. In addition, the French, Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed
Churches are represented in Britain, the first three having their own places of worship.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews, are the
Moslems and the Buddhists. The Moslems are the most widely represented; it is
estimated that the Islamic population of Britain may now number about 200,000, of
whom some 2,000 are in the Muslim Society of Great Britain. Their principal mosque
is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking, and there are also mosques in London,
Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow.
A Buddhist temple was opened in South Kensington, London, in 1954; and other
premises were opened in 1956 as a meeting place and discussion centre for the several
thousand adherents of Buddhism in Britain.
Co-operation between the Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation between
the Churches. The British Council of Churches was founded in 1942 and includes
official representatives from almost all the churches of the British Isles, with the
exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The council facilitates common action
between the churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian unity. The Archbishop
of Canterbury is president. In addition, most, though not all, of the Free Churches
in England and Wales are members of the Free Church Federal Council (formed in
1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of Evangelical Free Churches with
the National Free Church Council), the aims of which are to promote unity and joint
action between the Free Churches, and to provide a channel through which the Free
Churches can communicate and negotiate with central and local government organs
as a united body. Discussions on changes in organisation to allow of closer relations
between the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Presbyterian Church of England have been taking place for the
last few years. Conversations on the same subject are also being held between
representatives of the Church of England and the Methodist Church.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is advised on these matters, both at home and
abroad, by the Church of England Council on Inter-Church Relations.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at Amsterdam, Nether¬
lands, in 1948, and is to hold its third assembly in 1961 in New Delhi, India. The
council links together 171 churches in over 50 countries for co-operation in action
and the study of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
specific issues, but there is no machinery of continuous co-operation. The Council
of Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the
two religions, and deals with problems arising in the social field.
VIII. PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
The promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the concern of
those learned societies and institutions devoted specifically to this end, but only a
small part of the national research programme is carried out directly by them. Most
of the ‘pure’ or ‘fundamental’ research is conducted in the universities, which also
play an essential part in promoting the sciences by maintaining a steady supply of
trained scientists. In practice, it has become impossible to distinguish clearly between
science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the result that scientific
research has become the concern also of industry and of various Government
departments, a number of which maintain their own research establishments.
Today it is an acknowledged responsibility of the Government not only to under¬
take research directly but also to keep under review the facilities for the training of
scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain research projects,
and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of national interest. As a
result, a system of collaboration between the universities, industry and the Government
has developed, which leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to individual
scientists. The learned societies, whose membership is derived from all three categories,
play an important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research.
Important work is also undertaken by independent organisations—for example,
in medical research, by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund, the Nuffield Foundation (which as a charitable trust also undertakes
a wide range of other activities, see footnote on p. 142), the Lister Institute of
Preventive Medicine, the Wellcome Foundation and Trust, and by some large
pharmaceutical firms.
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organisation of science in Britain; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but they
have been a meeting ground where scientists can foregather for the exchange of ideas,
and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of knowledge can
flow. Although today most research operations are conducted under other auspices,
the learned societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread
of scientific knowledge and the application of new discoveries.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part in
promoting their own branches of science and are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
201
202
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Chemical Engineers, the Institution of Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry,
the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Biology, the National Institute of Industrial
Psychology and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activities) are
noted below.
The Royal Society (or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for the Improvement
of Natural Knowledge), founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs, although for two centuries scientists were in a minority among its
members, whose interests then lay mainly in history, art, archaeology or exploration.
The society has always been independent of State control but its advice on scientific
matters has frequently been sought by the Government. Today its influence remains
as strong as ever and its Fellows serve on most of the official advisory councils and
committees concerned with science. It appoints members of some non-governmental
committees, such as the British National Committee on Space Research (see p. 214).
Its Fellowship consists of approximately 600 eminent scientists and 60 foreign
members. Admission of the former is restricted to 25 a year, and of the latter to four
a year; a few eminent non-scientists are also elected to Fellowships. The society
maintains a library (about 145,000 volumes of a purely scientific nature), issues a large
number of publications, including the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings,
and convenes conferences which are attended by scientists from all countries.
In addition, the Royal Society is responsible for the administration of a number
of Government grants and of many research funds and special funds derived from
various sources. These funds and grants are used for the promotion of science through
research, publications, congresses, the award of medals, lectures, and in many other
ways. The highest honour bestowed by the Society is the Copley medal, for which
scientists of all nationalities are eligible.
In i960 the Royal Society celebrated the tercentenary of its foundation and among
the events to mark the occasion the Isaac Wolfson Foundation endowed a special
research professorship, known as the Wolfson Research Professorship of the
Royal Society.
During the International Geophysical Year (IGY), the observational phase of which
ran from mid-1957 until the end of 1958* the Royal Society co-ordinated the national
research effort by Government departments, universities and other institutions.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific, artistic,
technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, however, one of
the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and application to
useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose chiefly by the
dissemination of new scientific knowledge. The society regularly holds meetings
for the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective
media for the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments
which have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion of
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
203
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures’,
and the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday, who
established a tradition of research. Today, the Royal Institution has extensive research
laboratories, and lectures are given on recent developments in science and other
branches of knowledge. Its library of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific
works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief activities
is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well as by eminent
scientists. Its 14 sections cover the whole range of pure and applied science other
than medical science, and there is a division for studying the social and international
relations of science. In addition to the annual meeting and in order to extend its
influence, the association plans continuous activities throughout the year, in particular
special lectures, exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences),
the publication of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of
study groups and liaison with the press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has set up area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing respectively
with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to encourage scientists to
make their activities known to wider audiences. Collaboration with other scientific
organisations has always been an important function of the British Association, and
it has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific bodies and learned societies.
It has also played an important part in the development of science by taking or
recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and application of scientific
knowledge.
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF TECHNOLOGY
According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Labour, the number of
qualified scientists and engineers (i.e. holders of degrees or diplomas, or members of
certain professional institutions) in employment in Great Britain at the beginning
of 1959 was 173,000 (72,200 scientists and 100,800 engineers) representing an increase
of 28,000 or nearly one-fifth over the numbers recorded in a similar survey in 1956.
On the basis of the 1956 survey the Committee on Scientific Manpower of the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy estimated that over the next ten to fifteen years the current
annual output of some 10,000 qualified scientists and engineers would need to be
raised to 20,000. The Government accepted this figure as a reasonable goal and
supports measures to ensure that the universities and technical colleges together will
be able to produce at least this number. No detailed reassessment of the long-term
demand has been made as a result of the 1959 survey.
The Universities
The universities carry the main responsibility for the pursuit of fundamental
research and for the training of scientists. During recent years there has also been
a considerable expansion of technological training and research facilities within the
universities. For example, the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London,
the Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow, and the Manchester College
of Science and Technology provide degree and postgraduate courses for the univer¬
sities with which they are associated. At the new Churchill College, Cambridge,
204
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
70 per cent of the students will be studying scientific and technological subjects.
More than half of the students at universities are now studying some branch of
science or technology.
Eighteen of the 22 universities of the United Kingdom have faculties of engineering;
chemical and aeronautical engineering have been developed in recent years. Univer¬
sities in industrial centres have long been renowned for studies relating to their
local industries, such as metallurgy at Birmingham, Sheffield, Swansea and other
centres of the metals and metal-using industries, and naval architecture and marine
engineering at Glasgow, Liverpool, Durham and Southampton. In the textile areas,
Manchester offers courses in textile chemistry and engineering and Leeds has
specialised in courses and research in connection with the wool textile industry,
including colour chemistry and dyeing. Leeds is the only university in Britain that
has a department devoted to the study of leather manufacture, and Manchester offers
courses in paper technology. Sheffield is unique for its department of glass technology
—the pioneer among such departments in the world.
Nearly all universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have
laboratories or research departments. About 70 per cent of the recurrent income of
the universities and a very large proportion of their money for new building comes
from Government sources. There is no direct departmental control and the method
of administering the grant—through the University Grants Committee (see p. 165)
—is designed to ensure academic freedom. The universities also receive funds for
the furtherance of research from industrial organisations, foundations, and individuals
as well as from the Government research councils and the autonomous industrial
research associations. The Government research councils award a substantial number
of studentships for postgraduate training in science and technology, as well as post¬
doctoral research fellowships. Leading firms in such industries as chemicals, oil,
motor vehicles, textiles, electrical equipment, food, and mining provide grants for
specific research projects or endow research fellowships, such as the Imperial Chemical
Industries and Leverhulme Fellowships, or professorships. Foundations which
provide similar benefactions include the Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation,
the Carnegie Trust, the Wellcome Trust and Courtaulds’ Scientific and Educational
Trust Fund. Among individuals whose major contributions to universities
have included provision for research facilities are Lord Nuffield, with gifts to
the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, Lord Austin, who provided new buildings
for the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, members of the Wills family who financed
the Physics Laboratory at Bristol, members of the Boot family at Nottingham and of
the Brotherton family at Leeds.
There are several examples of continuous co-operation between industry and
commerce and the universities. A notable one is the Manchester Joint Research
Council, set up in 1944 by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the University
of Manchester: this body, on which the university and chamber are equally repre¬
sented, organises lectures and discussion meetings and conducts investigations into
the use made of research by industry. Another is the Glass Delegation of the University
of Sheffield, which is responsible for the general direction of the work of the Depart¬
ment of Glass Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council
of the University and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe funds for
the furtherance of training and research. An example of co-operation between a
Government department, an independent organisation and a university is the world’s
largest steerable pencil-beam radio telescope at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire (see also p. 214),
financed jointly by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Nuffield
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
205
Foundation, and Manchester University, which has been responsible for its
development.
Technical Colleges
The Government’s plans for a large-scale and rapid expansion of education in
advanced technology (outlined in 1956 in a White Paper, Cmd. 9703), include the
increase of advanced work at technical colleges as well as at the universities. Certain
technical colleges in England and Wales, which concentrate entirely on advanced
work, including postgraduate and research work, have been designated as ‘colleges of
advanced technology’ (see p. 169). In Scotland, advanced instruction in a wide range
of technologies is given at the Central Institutions (see p. 169).
Most postgraduate studentships and fellowships awarded by the Government
research councils may be held at colleges of advanced technology and technical
colleges as well as at universities.
RESEARCH IN INDUSTRY
Industrial research in Britain is conducted by industry in its own laboratories
independently of Government aid, by co-operative research associations which are
assisted in varying degrees by the Government, by independent institutes for sponsored
research, by consultant laboratories, by Government laboratories and by universities
and technical colleges. The main nationalised industries have their own research
establishments (particulars of which are given in the appropriate sections of Chapter X,
Industry), and also give financial support to organisations concerned with research
into matters of interest to them. Results of inquiries into research expenditure
are given on p. 221.
Research Associations
A scheme by which the Government helps groups of firms with similar interests
to form industrial research associations was started in 1915 with the decision to
create the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1959, there were
50 such research associations with a combined income of million, of which about
one-quarter was contributed by the Government through the Industrial Grants
Committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The amounts
of the Government grants are related to the contributions made by the industries
concerned. The industries served by the associations cover a very wide range, in
particular textiles, engineering, metallurgy, fuel and food manufacturing. This list
is not exclusive.
The research associations are autonomous bodies, governed by their own councils
whose members are mostly representatives of industry. The councils are advised by
research committees in the preparation of research programmes. The research asso¬
ciations make the results of their work known to their member firms by a variety of
methods, among which are bulletins, publications, lectures, films, training classes,
exhibitions and mobile demonstration units. (For an account of methods of
communicating the results of research see p. 221.)
Institutes for Sponsored Research
A number of institutes for sponsored research exist to do work on a confidential
basis for industry, the results and patents arising being retained as the property of
the sponsor. The principal institutes of this type are the Fulmer Research Institute,
Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire and the Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey.
206
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Research Development Corporation
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board
of Trade in 1949 under the Development of Inventions Act, 1948. Its primary function
is to develop and exploit, in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government departments and other public bodies. It may also develop
and exploit an invention from any other source where, in the corporation’s view, the
public interest requires it. Under the Development of Inventions Act, 1954, the NRDC
may promote or assist research to meet specific practical requirements, or may assist
the continuation of research which may lead to inventions of practical importance.
It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by the Board of Trade,
with powers, under the Development of Inventions Act, 1958, to borrow from Govern¬
ment funds to a total of £10 million up to 1968. Projects sponsored by the Corporation
include such varied items as electronic digital computers, towed flexible barges (known
as dracones), anti-tumour agents, an ultrasonic flow meter, a new form of transport
known as the hovercraft, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell as a transportable source of
electricity and new antibiotics called cephalosphorins.
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ORGANISATION
The active participation by the Government in scientific research is for the most
part a development of the twentieth century, though its association with science dates
back to a much earlier period.
Early Examples
In 1675, King Charles II established Britain’s first State-supported research
institution—the Royal Greenwich Observatory (now transferred to Herstmonceux,
Sussex)—to correct the tables of the positions of the moon and fixed stars ‘for the use
of his seamen’. The Geological Survey of Great Britain, the first national institution
of its kind in the world, was founded in 1835. I842, the Board of Inland Revenue
established a chemical laboratory which eventually developed into the Laboratory of
the Government Chemist, now transferred to the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research; and in 1854 the Meteorological Office was established by the
Board of Trade. All these Government departments were using scientific knowledge,
but there was little organised effort towards the application of the discoveries made
in pure science.
Evolution of the Research Organisations
Government scientific organisations, like many British institutions, evolved
gradually in response to changing social and economic circumstances.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods
of precise measurement, led to the establishment in 1900 of the National Physical
Laboratory under the control of the Royal Society, with a small grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep. Government
recognition of the importance of scientific research and its applications was hastened
by the first world war, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
(DSIR) was established in 1916 as a separate Government department. In 1918,
the DSIR took over financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory
from the Royal Society, but the society appoints a general board and an executive
committee which supervise scientific policy.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
207
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 administer the research
funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act of 1911. In 1920, the
committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), established
under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid provided by Parliament.
Agricultural research, in its early days, was not centrally organised. The first
research institutes were founded and initially maintained by private individuals;
Rothamsted Experimental Station, for example, the oldest of them, was founded
in 1843 by Sir John Lawes, who personally financed it until, in 1889, he endowed it
and set up the Lawes Agricultural Trust to administer the endowment. As research
became more costly, Government funds were sought and obtained, though the institute
remained independent. The Development Commission, set up under the Development
and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, recommended that financial aid should
be made available from the Development Fund to ‘aid and develop agriculture and
rural industries by promoting scientific research’. In 1911, the Development Fund
was used to promote a scheme which led to the establishment of many of the present-
day agricultural institutions. In 1931, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC)
was established by Royal Charter to be responsible for the general organisation and
development of agricultural research in Great Britain. In addition to advising the
agricultural departments on the programmes of the institutes and, in the early stages,
acting as scientific adviser to the Development Commission, the ARC was given
funds to spend at its own discretion. The ARC gradually took over the responsibilities
of the Development Commission for agricultural research. The Nature Conservancy,
which is concerned with the conservation of flora and fauna, was set up in 1949.
During the second world war, a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet
was created to co-ordinate defence research and civil research. This committee was
replaced in 1947 by two bodies: an Advisory Council on Scientific Policy to advise
the Lord President of the Council, who had come to be regarded as the minister
responsible for the formulation and execution of Government scientific policy;
and a Defence Research Policy Committee ‘to advise the Minister of Defence and
Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the formulation of scientific policy in
the defence field’.
Ministerial Responsibility for Civil Scientific Research
Ministerial responsibilities for Government scientific organisations were rearranged
following the governmental changes in October 1959. A Minister for Science was
appointed in conjunction with one of the ancient Offices of State traditionally within
the Cabinet (at first that of Lord Privy Seal, but on further Government changes in
July i960, that of Lord President of the Council) who is responsible to Parliament for
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council, the
Agricultural Research Council, the Nature Conservancy and the Overseas Research
Council, and is chairman of the five Privy Council committees to which they report.
He also exercises ministerial functions under the Atomic Energy Acts, and general
supervision over the programme of space research.
Other ministers remain responsible for the scientific establishments within their
own departments. But the Minister for Science, advised by the Advisory Council on
Scientific Policy, is broadly responsible for civil scientific policy.
The administrative staffs comprising the former Office of the Lord President
of the Council and the Atomic Energy Office have been merged into a single Office
of the Minister for Science, with a general division (corresponding to the former)
and an atomic energy division (corresponding to the latter).
2o8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Advisory Council on Scientific Policy
The members of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy, who are appointed
by the Minister for Science, include eminent scientists drawn from the universities,
industry and Government service.
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range of
interest, the Advisory Council has established standing committees on Scientific
Manpower; Scientific Library and Technical Information; Overseas Scientific
Relations and Statistics.
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research. It is governed by a Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, known as the Research Council, which, under the Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research Act, 1956, replaced the former Advisory Council.
The Research Council consists of as many members as may be determined by
the Minister for Science; in i960, it had a chairman and 11 members. It is charged
with the organisation, development and encouragement of scientific and industrial
research and with the dissemination of the results of such research. In particular,
it may:
(1) encourage and support scientific research in universities, technical colleges
and other institutions;
(2) establish or develop institutions or departments of institutions for investi¬
gation and research relating to the advancement of trade and industry; and
(3) take steps to further the practical application of the results of scientific and
industrial research.
These functions are discharged through 14 national research organisations under
the Research Council’s own control and direction and financed from its own \ ote,
and one, the Joint Fire Research Organisation, which is maintained by the DSIR
and the Fire Offices’ Committee; and through the autonomous research associations.
The council also makes grants for these purposes and for postgraduate instruction
in science and technology to individual workers and to institutions.
Since DSIR was set up, technological changes have necessitated a measure of
reorganisation. Science-based industries, such as the chemical and electrical industries,
have matured and prospered; entirely new industries, such as electronics, plastics,
synthetic fibres and synthetic rubber industries, have emerged. Industry, for its own
purposes and on behalf of the Government, has become the largest employer of
research workers. Organised teamwork has increasingly replaced individual effort
in scientific research, leading to a demand for trained research workers who can both
specialise and co-operate with colleagues trained in other subjects, and also for men of
outstanding qualities to direct large research departments. Research projects, at the
same time, have become increasingly expensive and have to be selected with more care.
Among the principal research stations operated by DSIR are: the National Physical
Laboratory, Teddington, Middlesex, which conducts research in various branches
of non-nuclear physics and maintains British primary standards and physical units;
the National Chemical Laboratory, also at Teddington, which concentrates on
basic chemical research not being done elsewhere applicable to a variety of industries;
the National Engineering Laboratory, at East Kilbride, Scotland; the Road Research
Laboratory, at Harmondsworth, Middlesex, which does research on road construction,

safety and traffic flow; the Building Research Station near Watford, Hertfordshire;
the Warren Spring Laboratory, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, opened in June 1959,
which provides facilities for research and development, including pilot-scale work
on subjects of national importance, which cannot be fitted into the programme of
other organisations; it undertakes sponsored research and teams from industry can
work there; its initial programme includes development of a pilot-scale plant for the
synthesis of liquid fuels; research on atmospheric pollution and research and develop¬
ment in mineral processing; the Tropical Products Institute, in London, transferred
to DSIR from the Colonial Office in April 1959, which aims at improving the economic
viability of the less-developed countries of the tropics, especially those within the
Commonwealth, by research into new uses for tropical plant and animal products;
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, in London, transferred to DSIR from the
Treasury in July 1959, which provides a wide variety of analytical, investigatory and
advisory services to all Government departments on request, and has a statutory
function as official analyst and as an adjudicator in cases of disputed analyses; in
addition it undertakes various research projects, including the development of chemical
and physical methods of analysis; and the Radio Research Station at Slough, Bucking¬
hamshire, which, besides carrying out research on radio wave propagation and space
research, has housed, since October 1956, the World Data Centre for the IGY and
latterly a similar Data Centre for scientific information obtained from space vehicles.
The DSIR is expanding its activities under a second five-year plan for the years
1959-64; expenditure—at £61 million—will be nearly double that of ^36 million
under the first five-year plan 1954-59. Expansion will continue steadily throughout
the period, and for the year 1963-64 is planned to reach £14 million. The largest
increase will be in scientific research grants to universities. Postgraduate awards
to students will be increased by about 10 per cent each year until, in 1963-64, it is
hoped that some 3,800 students will be receiving DSIR grants for research training.
In the same year, DSIR support for special research in universities should reach about
^1-75 million a year. Expansion of staff in the DSIR’s own laboratories is to proceed
at the rate of about 6 per cent a year. Grants to the 50 research associations in the
DSIR scheme will be increased to over £2 million a year by 1964. The Research
Council will continue its policy of encouraging industry to bear an increasing proportion
of the total cost. The actual expansion of the research association movement will thus
probably be proportionately greater than the increase in the Government grant. It
has also been decided to devote much more attention and money to ensure that the
results of research are known and applied (see pp. 221-2).
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the successor of the Medical Research
Committee, was incorporated under its present title by Royal Charter in 1920.
The MRC is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Medical Research,
of which the Minister for Science is chairman and the Secretaries of State for the
Home Department, Scotland, Commonwealth Relations, and the Colonies, and the
Ministers of Health and of Labour are members.
The members of the MRC, appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council
for Medical Research for a period of four years, are twelve in number. Nine members,
representing different branches of medical knowledge and the fundamental sciences
on which these are based, are appointed after consultation with the President of the
Royal Society and with the MRC itself: on retirement, these scientific members are
not eligible for immediate reappointment. Of the three lay members of the council,
210
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
one must be a member of the House of Lords and one a member of the House
of Commons.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote scientific investigations to obtain new
knowledge likely to be of value in the field of curative and preventive medicine. In
planning and carrying out its research programme, the council is often assisted by
special committees appointed to advise on particular subjects. Its arrangements for
the support of research fall under three main headings:
(1) investigations by members of the council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in its own research establishments;
(2) temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere; and
(3) research fellowships and scholarships for tenure both at home and abroad.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead, London,
is the council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are 70 smaller establish¬
ments, generally known as research units, which are attached in most cases to univer¬
sities and hospitals in the United Kingdom. The council also undertakes work overseas
and, with additional support from colonial development and welfare funds, maintains
laboratories in the Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter
in 1931. It is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural
Research, consisting of the Minister for Science, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Under the Agricultural Research Act, 1956, the ARC was charged with the organisa¬
tion and development of agricultural research, and an Agricultural Research Fund was
established, into which are paid the parliamentary grant-in-aid and other sums
received by the council, and out of which are met all expenses incurred by the council
under the Act or in accordance with the terms of its charter. The accounts of the fund
are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
The council consists of not more than 18 nor fewer than 15 members, five of whom
are appointed for their general experience of and interest in agriculture. Others
are appointed by the Committee of the Privy Council, after consultation with the
President of the Royal Society, on account of their qualifications in one or other of
the sciences relating to agriculture. Included in the council’s membership are the
Chief Scientific Adviser (Agriculture) and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, also one member appointed by the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and one by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The
council has 23 research stations and units under its direct control in Great Britain,
including three laboratories concerned with the preservation, storage and protection
of foodstuffs, transferred from the DSIR in July 1959, when the ARC assumed responsi¬
bility for Government research on food (other than fish), taking over from DSIR
the Low Temperature Research Station, the Ditton Laboratory and the Pest Infestation
Laboratory.
It is also responsible for the financing of the independent research institutes (see
p. 205) in England and Wales (but not in Scotland). The programmes of all these
institutes are co-ordinated and approved by the council and are integrated with
those of the independent research institutes in Scotland, which are grant-aided by the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
211
The council makes grants to universities and other recognised research institutions
for special investigations, and awards research fellowships and postgraduate student¬
ships in agricultural and veterinary science, agricultural and dairy engineering
and statistics.
Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy was established by Royal Charter in 1949 and is
responsible to the Privy Council Committee for Nature Conservation. Its functions,
as summarised in the charter, are ‘to provide scientific advice on the conservation and
control of the natural flora and fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage
nature reserves in Great Britain, including the maintenance of physical features of
scientific interest; and to organise and develop the research and scientific service
related thereto’.
Research stations have been set up by the Nature Conservancy at Merlewood,
Grange-over-Sands, in Lancashire, Furzebrook, Wareham, in Dorset, and Speyside,
Inverness and field stations at Moor House, Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross,
where long-term ecological research is undertaken into such problems as the relation
of vegetation to soils and climates, peat growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning,
coastal erosion and roadside spraying. Grants are made for research, and the Nature
Conservancy awards annually a number of postgraduate studentships.
Overseas Research Council
The Government established the Overseas Research Council in July 1959. The
council is under the general control of a committee of the Privy Council and its
principal functions are to formulate policy in respect of scientific research for overseas,
and to co-ordinate advice and assistance on research matters provided by the United
Kingdom research councils and the various colonial research committees (see p. 217).
Matters concerning scientific development in the United Kingdom dependencies, in
Commonwealth countries and in countries outside the Commonwealth can be referred
to it. The council thus provides a central point to which Commonwealth Government
and research institutions can refer for advice and information, and advises generally
on United Kingdom co-operation in scientific research overseas.
Nuclear Energy
Before 1946 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was responsible
for atomic energy research and development. From 1946 to the end of 1953 this responsi¬
bility rested with the Minister of Supply. Because of its growing industrial applications,
however, the Government decided to transfer responsibility for atomic energy to a
non-departmental organisation. As a result, in January 1954, ministerial responsibility
(except for weapons production) was transferred to the Lord President of the Council;
and the Atomic Energy Authority Act, 1954, established the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority (UKAEA) which, in August 1954, took over responsibility, under
the Lord President, for atomic energy research and development. Ministerial responsi¬
bility under the Atomic Energy Acts was assumed by the Prime Minister in April
1957, and in October 1959 was transferred to the Minister for Science (then the Lord
Privy Seal, now the Lord President of the Council).
The Minister of Aviation has taken over from the former Minister of Supply
responsibility for the development and production of atomic weapons for the Services
in accordance with agreed defence policy; in practice, however, the Atomic Energy
212
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Authority produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for atomic weapons
under contract and carries out weapon research. The Minister of Power (in Scotland,
the Secretary of State) has a general responsibility for the civil nuclear power
programme; the power stations are being built and will be operated by the electricity
authorities. The Admiralty is concerned (in close collaboration with the Atomic
Energy Authority) in the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion, and has
a general responsibility for the application of nuclear propulsion in merchant ships.
The Authority collaborates with a number of other Government departments—the
Ministries of Health, Labour, Housing and Local Government, Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, Transport, the Post Office, the Scottish Office, and the Home Office—
on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic energy.
Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and Agricultural
Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee. This
committee advises ministers on the administration of the Radioactive Substances
Acts which deal with the safeguards necessary in the use of radioactive substances
and apparatus producing radiation.
The Atomic Energy Authority
The Atomic Energy Authority, appointed by the Minister for Science, consists
of a chairman, and not fewer than seven nor more than fifteen other members.
The authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-to-day
Government control (subject to the power given to the responsible minister to issue
directions to the authority in matters of over-riding national importance), but differs
from them in that the bulk of its revenue is derived from money voted by Parliament
and in that its accounts are certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
The organisation is divided into four groups controlling various establishments
and has a London office, which is responsible for central financial, administrative
and establishment matters, and for raw material procurement.
The Research Group, centred at Harwell, Berkshire, conducts research into all
aspects of atomic energy. Much of its work is of a fundamental nature without direct
regard to particular applications. Most of the applied research at Harwell is now
devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, although some assistance is given on specific
problems relating to weapons. In addition to numerous research reactors and acceler¬
ating machines, Harwell houses Hermes—the largest isotope separator in Europe—
and an apparatus for investigating controlled thermonuclear reactions—Zeta (Zero
Energy Thermonuclear Assembly). In order to study the basic scientific principles
involved in such reactions, a new apparatus, Icse (Intermediate Current Stability
Experiment), which will be capable of operating at higher pressures and faster rates
of increase of electric current, is being built at a new research centre at Culham,
Oxfordshire, to which all controlled thermonuclear research work is to be removed.
Such experiments in Britain and elsewhere may lead to the possibility of obtaining
almost unlimited supplies of energy from water.
A second main research centre at Winfrith, Dorset, is concerned mainly with
research into reactor design and development. A high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor known as Zenith started operating there in December 1959. It will be used
to establish design characteristics for a larger 20 MW reactor—Dragon—financed
jointly by a number of member countries of the Organisation for European Economic
Co-operation (OEEC), including members of the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom). The United Kingdom will provide the largest share and retain ownership
of the Dragon reactor.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
213
The research group is concerned with preparing and distributing radioisotopes
and other radioactive substances. Marketing of these materials has now been taken
over by the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, which has been
enlarged to meet a demand for radioactive products which has more than trebled since
1955. Harwell also runs an isotope school, started in April 1951, and a reactor school,
started in September 1954, which provide training for home and overseas students.
The Development and Engineering Group is responsible for development, design
and construction of reactors and associated plants (except for some development work
which is undertaken by the research group); for engineering consultant work for the
electricity authorities, overseas organisations and the nuclear power companies; and
for the general engineering design and construction of all major building projects.
The group has its headquarters at Risley, Lancashire, and it includes the Dounreay
Experimental Reactor Establishment, Caithness, Scotland (housing an experimental
fast-breeder reactor, a materials testing reactor and a prototype submarine reactor),
the Culcheth Laboratories, Lancashire, and research and development organisations
at Capenhurst (Cheshire), Windscale (Cumberland) and Springfields (Lancashire).
The Production Group is responsible for the operation of UKAEA factories (includ¬
ing the Calder Hall and Chapelcross reactors); research and development concerned
with factory processes; and commercial activities taken over from the industrial power
branch of the former industrial group.
The production group’s headquarters is at Risley, Lancashire, and its plants are
at Capenhurst, Cheshire (for the production of enriched uranium); Springfields,
Lancashire (for uranium metal production and the manufacture of reactor fuel
elements); Windscale, Cumberland (now being expanded as one of the national
centres for the development of advanced gas-cooled reactors as well as for chemical
processing); Calder Hall, Cumberland; and Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire, both of
which produce plutonium and electricity, the former also housing a reactor operation
school, established in 1957.
The Weapons Group, centred at Aldermaston, Berkshire, conducts research on
and development of nuclear weapons, including the explosion of test weapons, both
under Ministry of Aviation contract and in its own right. The group also carries out
research work on controlled thermonuclear reactions.
National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science
In February 1957, the Government set up a National Institute for Research in
Nuclear Science, which provides, for common use by universities and others, facilities
and equipment which are beyond the scope of individual universities and institutions
carrying out research in the nuclear field. It does not replace the research already
being done in individual universities with assistance from Government funds; nor does
it affect the Government’s participation in the international scheme for common
facilities set up in Geneva under the auspices of the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research (CERN). The institute is financed in the main by grants through the
Atomic Energy Authority from the Atomic Energy Vote. The Rutherford High
Energy Laboratory being built at Harwell will house the institute’s proton synchrotron
(particle accelerator). This 7,000 million electron volt apparatus, now under
construction, will be one of the largest such machines in the world.
Space Research
A United Kingdom programme of upper atmosphere research using Skylark
rockets has continued since its initiation in association with the International
214
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Geophysical Year. By the end of 1959 over 20 successful experiments had been
carried out at the Woomera launching ground in Australia and valuable information
obtained on winds, temperature and electron density, at heights of up to about 100
miles. The Skylark, however, was designed as an upper atmosphere research tool and
is not strictly a space vehicle.
The United Kingdom’s role in space research was considered by the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy in its report for 1958-59. It recognised that British science
and technology had much to contribute in space research, but considered that this
contribution should be part of an internationally based approach.
At present a limited programme of scientific experiments is in hand. A Steering
Group on Space Research has been set up to advise the Minister for Science who has
general co-ordinating responsibility for the programme as a whole. A British National
Committee on Space Research appointed by the Royal Society is responsible for its
scientific aspects, and co-operates with international scientific bodies such as the
Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), a special committee of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). As a first stage, in May 1959, the Government
announced approval for a programme for the design and construction of instruments
to be carried in earth satellites. Advantage is also being taken of a United States offer
to launch satellites containing scientific instruments designed and constructed in
other countries, and experiments designed in the United Kingdom are to be included
in a Scout satellite, due to be launched from a site in the United States in the latter
part of 1961. This satellite will be the first of a series under a joint programme with
the United States. Ways of intensifying Commonwealth and European co-operation
are also being considered and the United Kingdom is playing its full part in the United
Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
Apart from this programme, work is in hand to determine the feasibility of adapting
British military rockets to provide means of launching a British satellite, should an
all-British effort be decided upon.
The successful launching of the United States satellite Pioneer V was carried
through with the help of the Jodrell Bank radio telescope (see also p. 204), which
sent the signal to separate the satellite from the third stage of the rocket vehicle and
other signals switching on and off the rocket’s transmitters. While the main purpose
of the telescope is the study of stars, very distant nebulae and galaxies detectable only
from their emission of electromagnetic waves, it is also being used extensively in the
tracking of space rockets and earth satellites and has sent the first messages reflected
from the moon and Venus. Tracking is also being carried out at the Radio Research
Station of the DSIR, which also provides one of the three World Data Centres,
set up to continue work of this kind initiated in connection with the International
Geophysical Year.
Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All departments rely on one or other of the Government research councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have set up supplementary research organisations of their own.
Defence Research with Civil Applications
Research and development undertaken by the Admiralty is primarily directed
to meeting the requirements of the Royal Navy, but a substantial amount of this
work has important civil applications. For instance, besides sponsoring research
into nuclear propulsion for ships (see p. 118) the Admiralty is responsible through the

and the National Institute of Oceanography, which are mainly in the civil field, are also
administered by the Admiralty. At the former, the 98-inch Isaac Newton optical
telescope now being built will be the largest in Britain.
T. he Ministry of Aviation carries out most of the research needed to meet the
technical requirements of defence and is also responsible for some civil research,
e.g., at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the National Gas Turbine Establishment
at Farnborough, and the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. Some fundamental
research is also carried out for the ministry by universities and industrial organisations.
The Air Ministry finances the Meteorological Office, which is responsible for
research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly directed to non-military ends. Its
three main divisions—at present in London, at Harrow, Middlesex, and at Dunstable,
Bedfordshire—are being transferred to a new building under erection at Bracknell,
Berkshire.
The Forecasting Research Section has recently been equipped with a large-capacity
electronic computer. Balloon and aircraft soundings and radar techniques are used to
investigate the movement and composition of the atmosphere, and instruments are
being designed which will be used in rockets and an earth-satellite. The Air Ministry
also makes grants for fundamental meteorological research carried out under the
auspices of the Royal Society or in university departments.
Agriculture
Apart from research at the centres controlled or grant-aided by the Agricultural
Research Council and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out a certain amount of applied research
in its own veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian,
Scotland, and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire;
while at its infestation control laboratories at Tolworth and Worplesdon, Surrey, it
conducts research into problems affecting the destruction and control of insect pests
of stored food, rodent pests and other animal and bird pests. The Scientific Services
of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland in Edinburgh undertake
a number of statutory duties and international obligations in regard to crop improve¬
ment and crop protection. Research is carried out as it arises from this work. In
Northern Ireland, research in all the major agricultural sciences is carried out in
conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture.
Fisheries
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are: the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, which maintains four laboratories for marine, shell-fish, salmon
and freshwater fisheries research, and four research vessels; the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, which maintains a marine research laboratory,
four research ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater research laboratory at Pitlochry;
and the Development Commissioners.
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on Fishery
Research, co-ordinate all fishery research. From the Development Fund a number
of independent institutions receive grants for marine and freshwater research.
Food
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science and
Atomic Energy Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
H
2l6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
responsible for all scientific and technical aspects of departmental food policy; it
identifies problems in food procurement, processing, utilisation and distribution which
require investigation; and it arranges for such investigations to be made at appro¬
priate research centres. It also promotes the application of the results of research,
either directly or in co-operation with the food industries concerned. The division,
which has its own experimental laboratories and kitchens in London, includes sections
dealing with nutrition, food technology and food in relation to defence, as well as a
central liaison section.
The Food Research Advisory Committee, appointed by the minister, advises on
food problems (other than fish) requiring investigation or research which should be
undertaken with the aid of public funds, and makes recommendations as to the
priorities to be afforded to such problems. The Committee comprises representatives
of the food industry and of organisations concerned with food research.
Forestry
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvicultural
and allied problems. By means of grants, it also aids forest research work undertaken
by various universities and other institutions, including the Imperial Forestry
Institute, Oxford.
Fuel and Power
The Minister of Power is responsible for research on safety in mines and under¬
takes a certain amount of research into the development and economical utilisation
of fuel and power, notably in connection with oil synthesis. The nationalised coal,
electricity and gas industries are required to submit their research plans for his con¬
currence and there is close collaboration between the Ministry of Power, the scientific
departments of these industries and the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research. Oil companies themselves carry on extensive research into petroleum
products (see p. 311).
Transport
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into aspects of marine
navigation, marine propulsion, and road construction, but most of the basic work
is carried out for the ministry by the Admiralty, the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research and the Ministry of Aviation which is also responsible for research
into airport operations. Research on radio aids for marine navigation is undertaken
by the Admiralty.
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for policy relating
to the use and development of land in England and Wales. The ministry deals with
technical planning and geographical, geological, economic and sociological research.
Similar arrangements are made in Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government is responsible for the general
administration of the planning legislation in Northern Ireland.
Building
The Building Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research is responsible for reviewing the whole field of research and technical develop¬
ment of the building industry and, with the Ministry of Works, for ensuring that the
results of research are made available to the industry.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS

Communications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects relating
to telephone, telegraph and radio systems which is carried out by the engineering
department. Examples of such research are the gradual introduction of automatic
dialling for long-distance telephone calls, and the progressive mechanisation of
postal and clerical operations. It also undertakes the experimental development of
radio transmitters and receivers for Post Office services and other Government
departments. Development in the application of electronics for the telephone services
is being planned in conjunction with industry through the Joint Electronic Research
Committee. The Post Office keeps in close touch with the British Broadcasting Corpora¬
tion (BBC) and the Independent Television Authority (ITA) in connection with the
development of broadcasting techniques.
Medicine and Health
In addition to the work carried on under the aegis of the Medical Research Council,
the Ministry of Health may conduct and promote research into the cause, prevention
and treatment of illness.
The Department of Health for Scotland has similar responsibilities, in the discharge
of which it is advised by its Advisory Committee on Medical Research; liaison with the
Medical Research Council is also maintained.
In Northern Ireland, the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the Minister
of Health and Local Government) has power to conduct or assist medical research.
In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate bacteriological and
pathological services.
The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (1) analysis
and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into the treat¬
ment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics; and (4)
mental health.
Research in the Huma?i Sciences
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research promotes research in the human
sciences in three ways. On the advice of its Human Sciences Committee it awards
grants for special researches to universities, colleges of advanced technology, and other
research institutions. Work in the general field of the human sciences is conducted
as part of the programme of the Building Research Station, the Road Research
Laboratory and the National Physical Laboratory. A Human Sciences Section at the
Warren Spring Laboratory has its own programme of research, some of which will
be put out on contract to universities and other research institutions.
Colonial Research
The bulk of the research work relating to colonial development is done in the
colonial territories and is assisted by funds made available under the Colonial Develop¬
ment and Welfare Acts. Much of it requires close collaboration with research institutes
and laboratories in Britain. The Overseas Research Council advises on general
questions of policy and co-ordination. Specialist committees deal with research into
such subjects as agriculture, animal health, forestry, medicine, social science, and
colonial products.
Anti-Locust Research
An example of Britain’s research work on behalf of colonial territories is provided
by the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, which has been internationally

recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931. This organisation receives
and co-ordinates information on locust movements and breeding from some 40
countries, undertakes scientific research into the life history and habits of the different
species of locust, and investigates and develops methods for their control and
destruction. In co-operation with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organi¬
sation (FAO), it provides an information service on the movements of desert locusts
and provides forecasts of swarm movements which are distributed to the countries
threatened.
Other Research Work
There are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government depart¬
ments which undertake research work in addition to their other scientific activities.
These include the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759, containing the
largest collection of living plants in the world, and the Ordnance Survey Department,
both now administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The three research departments at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, are: the
Herbarium, concerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination
of plants; the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant physiology,
cytology and genetics; and the Museum of Economic Botany, dealing with the economic
exploitation of plants. The library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853;
it consists of more than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and separately
issued items and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings of plants.
The Ordnance Survey Department was founded in 1791 to prepare a map of Great
Britain mainly for defence purposes. Its present work is chiefly civil in character
(see p. 49).
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognised as a leading research institution.
The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science
in all countries, but chiefly in Great Britain, which has always held a leading place
in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the development
of industrial machinery and processes, all of which are represented in the museum’s
collections.
The geology of Britain is known in more exact detail than that of any other country
in the world, and the Geological Survey (since 1919 an establishment of DSIR),
responsible for this work, has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum.
These three museums are in South Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and Industry,
in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939
by members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary
Science Committee. It is one of a number of informal, unofficial, all-party parliamen¬
tary groups which have grown up spontaneously and have varying degrees of influence.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also
to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
219
organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution. Membership in
i960 comprised 178 members of Parliament and representatives of 109 scientific
and technological institutions.
The committee provides, as far as possible, for a regular exchange of information
between members of Parliament and scientists, and endeavours to ensure that action
is taken to correct matters seen to be wrong in the light of such information.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations;
the organisation of a country’s scientific research would, therefore, be incomplete
without provision for adequate liaison with other countries.
Before the second world war, international scientific collaboration took place
through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships and fellowships,
the close relations existing between the learned societies in Britain and their equivalent
bodies abroad, and through international conferences and congresses.
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in overseas scientific collaboration, including the exchange of scientific
information. Well-known examples are the specialised agencies of the United
Nations Organisation, e.g., the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation,
and those concerned with nuclear energy, e.g., the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the European
Nuclear Energy Agency, in all of which the United Kingdom is playing a full part.
The United Kingdom is also represented on the Governing Committee for Scientific
and Technical Personnel of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation
(OEEC) and on the Science Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO), and collaborates bilaterally with a number of countries in nuclear energy.
Besides agreements between the respective atomic energy authorities, there are inter¬
governmental agreements with eight countries, including the United States, with
which collaboration is now particularly close. There are permanent representatives
of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in London and of the UKAEA
in Washington. Controlled thermonuclear (fusion) reactions and nuclear marine propul¬
sion are two important subjects on which there are regular discussions and exchanges
of experts.
Among the various channels through which scientific liaison is conducted are:
The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices
A feature of the war-time pattern of scientific collaboration was the establishment
of scientific missions in London by the United States and Commonwealth countries,
and in Washington by the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. The latter
subsequently joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office (North
America).
In 1946, a British Commonwealth Scientific Conference was held to see how the
war-time collaboration and co-operation could be continued and extended. Amongst
the recommendations of the Conference was the continuance of the British Common¬
wealth Scientific Office (North America) and the establishment of the British
Commonwealth Scientific Offices (London), a group of offices containing the scientific
representatives of Commonwealth countries with whom the Overseas Liaison Group
of the DSIR is closely associated.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations
This is a committee of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy which was set up
after the war to consider and advise on United Kingdom Government policy on
matters of overseas scientific relations. In view of the Government’s increasing
interest in international organisation for scientific co-operation, the committee was
reconstituted in 1958 as a small committee concerned primarily with questions of
policy and scientific co-operation. The chairman of the Advisory Council on Scientific
Policy acts as its chairman, and its secretariat is provided jointly by the Office of the
Minister for Science and the Overseas Liaison Group of the DSIR.
The Overseas Liaison Group of the DSIR
This group, which is part of the Information Division of the DSIPv, is broadly
responsible for the overseas relations and activities of the department. In addition
to its executive work for the Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations,
it is responsible for the administration of the scientific attaches, advisers and missions
at present stationed in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Stockholm, Moscow and New
Delhi. These representatives are accredited to a total of 11 countries (Austria, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, India, Norway, the Soviet Union, Sweden, Switzerland
and the United States) and are also concerned with five others (Belgium, Finland,
Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) as required. The group is responsible for
ensuring that information collected by representatives is effectively disseminated in the
United Kingdom. The attaches, advisers and missions and the Overseas Liaison Group
itself have inter-departmental responsibilities, although the group is placed within the
DSIR for convenience of organisation.
The group forms the United Kingdom element of the British Commonwealth
Scientific Offices (London) and is also associated, through the United Kingdom
Scientific Mission in Washington, with the British Commonwealth Scientific Office
(North America). It is responsible for the DSIR interests in a number of international
organisations, e.g., OEEC, NATO, UNESCO, ILO.
Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
Machinery exists in the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux for liaison in the
field of agricultural science between countries of the Commonwealth. In the United
Kingdom there are ten bureaux, specialising in various branches of agricultural science,
and two institutes—the Commonwealth Mycological Institute and the Commonwealth
Institute of Entomology. A third institute, the Commonwealth Institute of Biological
Control, has its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The bureaux collect, collate and
disseminate information resulting from agricultural research.
The British Council
The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied sciences are to foster closer
co-operation between British scientists and scientists of other countries, and to
promote a better understanding of Britain among overseas specialists by disseminating
a knowledge of British activities and achievements. Under the first objective the
exchange of visits between scientists in the United Kingdom and other countries is of
prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or advisory tours overseas by eminent
British scientists, the British Council, among many activities of a similar nature, brings
to the United Kingdom every year a number of senior overseas specialists, postgraduate
students and technologists on visits of varying duration, for the purpose of study
in British universities and other institutions, or for discussion with British experts.
In addition to publishing the British Medical Bulletin, a journal issued every four
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
221
months and intended primarily to keep overseas specialists informed of progress in
medical research in Britain, the council maintains an extensive and much used specialist
information service. In some 70 countries in which the British Council is represented,
libraries are maintained and in many instances these have strong sections of scientific
and technological literature.
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departments for
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), and scientists serve
on the staffs of a number of its overseas offices. The British Council is advised by
eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and on specialist
panels for the different subjects.
Expenditure on Research and Development
The most comprehensive survey of the pattern of the research and development
effort in Great Britain was published in the report of the Advisory Council on Scientific
Policy for 1956-57. It indicated that in the year 1955-56 Britain spent about £300
million on research and development (though this figure is subject to a margin of
error). Of the total expenditure, some £185 million, or 62 per cent, was spent by private
industry, mainly on Government account. Nationalised industries were estimated
to have spent ^4 million.
These estimates, in so far as they concerned industry, were based on the preliminary
results of an inquiry conducted by DSIR, a description of which, with final results,
was published in December 1958. The largest expenditure was by the following
industries: aircraft (44 per cent), electrical engineering (18 per cent), chemicals (13
per cent) and shipbuilding (8 per cent). The survey also showed that, according to
the most reliable estimates available, about 46,600 professionally qualified scientists
and engineers were then engaged on research and development in the United Kingdom,
including about 2,200 research workers in agriculture and medicine.
A recent unofficial estimate1 based on official figures2 suggests that by 1959 the
numbers had increased by about 17 per cent, roughly half of them being employed by
private industry and slightly more than one-tenth by the defence departments.
Expenditure on research in 1958—59 was put at ,£420-445 million, of which just under
half was financed by private industry.
The latest official estimates to be published are given in Industrial Research and
Development Expenditure, 1958. These estimates refer only to expenditure by or
through private industry, which amounted to £300 million in 1958 compared with
^185 million in 1955. Of this, less than half was provided by the Government through
defence contracts in 1958, compared with a proportion of nearly two-thirds in 1955'
About 95 per cent was spent in industry’s own establishments and 5 Per cent on
payment to outside bodies such as co-operative research associations, universities
and other public and private research institutions.
Communicating Results of Research
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and to ultimate
users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of information has
grown. It is necessary, therefore, to supplement the methods generally in use
publication in learned and specialised journals, abstracting services, exhibitions,

conferences, press, radio and television—by more extensive measures for improving
personal contacts between industry and sources of scientific and technical knowledge.
The DSIR devotes approximately a quarter of its resources to information services.
The Information Division at DSIR headquarters in London supplements the informa¬
tion work done at its research establishments and promotes information activities of
various kinds. The Lending Library Unit in London (LLU), added to these services
in !957> is tlie nucleus of the new National Lending Library for Science and Tech¬
nology (NLL), which is to start operations at Boston Spa, Yorkshire, in 1961. The
new library, which will be in full operation in 1962, will cover all subjects in science
and technology other than some branches of medicine: it will take over the responsi¬
bility for the lending service now provided by the Science Museum Library. The
NLL is responsible for extending the volume of translations and of Russian scientific
literature which are available. The organisation issues a ‘Translations Bulletin’ which
contains lists of books, journals, and other scientific papers which are now available
in translation, or which are to be translated in the near future. It collaborates with the
National Science Foundation of the United States in arranging for translations, and it
holds an extensive collection of translations of Russian scientific literature which
may be borrowed.
The Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) runs a
technical information department and maintains a Commonwealth index of trans¬
lations and a panel of 135 translators. The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
provide abstracts and an information service for agricultural science. The Agricultural
Research Council publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in Progress, and in its
annual reports gives accounts of developments in current research.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
The preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage and the promotion of literature
and the arts are the active concern of a number of official and unofficial bodies.
There is no Ministry of Fine Arts or equivalent organisation to formulate or
administer policy in the arts, though bodies such as the Standing Commission on
Museums and Galleries and the Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and for
Scotland act in an advisory capacity. Government interest in the arts is expressed
mainly through the provision of grants to such bodies as the Arts Council, the British
Council (see also footnote on p. 171), the British Film Institute, and the Council of
Industrial Design, and also to the national museums and art galleries.
Government expenditure on the arts (which, in 1938-39, amounted to a little more
than £900,000) is now over £7 million. Of this total, over £3 million is the cost
of the national art collections in museums and art galleries, £1-5 million the amount
of the grant to the Arts Council, and more than £1 million is expenditure on pre¬
serving historic houses and their contents. In addition, under the Local Government
Act, 1948, local authorities may use part of the revenue from the rates for the encourage¬
ment of the arts. Local education authorities also make grants to some schools of art,
music and drama. In Northern Ireland, the Council for the Encouragement of Music
and the Arts (CEMA) receives a grant from the Northern Ireland Government of
£21,000 plus up to a maximum of £7,000 on a £ for £ basis on contributions from
local authorities.
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, e.g., the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the
Pilgrim Trust, the United Kingdom branch of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation,
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
223
and a large number of societies, associations and other organisations concerned with
separate aspects of the arts, some of which are mentioned later in this chapter.
A development since the second world war has been the increasing support the
arts are deriving from business firms. In recent years, such industrial patronage has
amounted to some £50,000 annually. In addition, the Independent Television
programme companies (see Chapter XV) are spending jointly over £100,000 a year
on the encouragement of the arts. A co-ordinating committee has been set up to
ensure that the donations of the individual companies do not overlap.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution in the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government departments, local authorities and other organisations
on any matter connected directly or indirectly with these aims. The corresponding
body in Northern Ireland is CEMA, the board of which consists of members nominated
by the Minister of Education for Northern Ireland and the Senate of Queen’s
University, together with members elected by the Association of CEMA.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917. The trust, which was
initially founded for ‘the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, six trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and three trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural policies include the support of adult amateur activities in music,
drama and the visual arts. It also assists non-national museums. Grants totalling
£23,767 were made for these purposes during the year ended 31st December, 1959.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The trust, which has an income of about £170,000 a year, is
administered by a body of trustees who are empowered to make grants towards
any legally charitable object within the United Kingdom. In fact, the greater part
of the trust’s income is at present being used to help to preserve the nation’s heritage
of architecture and history, and for the advancement of learning and the arts. The
grants made for these objects during 1959 amounted to £152,000.
The Calouste Gulhenkian Foundation of Lisbon was established under the will of
the late Calouste Gulbenkian who died in 1955. The foundation has a branch in
the United Kingdom, which is responsible for the foundation’s activities in Britain
and in other Commonwealth countries. During 1959, grants totalling £76,500 were
made to the arts in the United Kingdom. A small private committee, under the chair¬
manship of Lord Bridges, was set up by the foundation to examine the needs of the
arts in Britain and reported to the trustees in June 1959. It recommended that greater
support should be given to the arts, that there should be more scope for experiment,
that the arts should be made more accessible to the public, particularly in the provinces,
and that more should be done to foster appreciation of the arts among the young.
VISUAL ARTS
There are at present a number of British painters and sculptors of international
repute as well as younger artists of great promise; and public interest in their work
and that of their contemporaries overseas, as well as in that of British and foreign
224
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
artists of the past, is increasing. This wider interest in visual art has not stopped
at appreciation. There is evidence of this fact in the large numbers attending evening
art classes, the growth of local art groups and local exhibitions, and the support given
to holiday painting schools.
The fine arts of painting and sculpture in Britain receive State support by grants
to national institutions and, indirectly, through grants made to the Arts Council,
to municipal art galleries and museums, and to local education authorities for art
schools and other means of promoting education in art.
In the year April 1959 to the end of March i960 the Arts Council arranged 58
separate art exhibitions in Great Britain; 342 showings of these exhibitions were
given in 151 different centres. In Northern Ireland, 26 exhibitions were arranged
by CEMA. Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council
by means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions and photographs, lectures,
and the provision of information and advice to inquirers abroad and to visitors in
Britain. In the year ended March i960, 24 fine art exhibitions organised by the council
were shown in 41 countries. The council was also responsible for British participation
in five international exhibitions. Since 1948, 30 international awards have been won
by British artists.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 900 museums and art galleries open to the public in the
United Kingdom, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms
set aside in a public building for the display of local treasures.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British Museum,
which celebrated its bicentenary in 1953, has unparalleled collections of archaeological
and ethnographical material from every part of the world, in addition to housing
the national library of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and periodicals; its
Department of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the widest extent and
richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of fine and applied art
of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to material, though since the
war primary collections have been arranged to bring together, by style, period or
nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National Gallery presents paintings by
almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate Gallery embodies two collections:
the British school from the eighteenth century onwards, with a few earlier works,
and modern foreign schools (since 1850). Both sections include modern sculpture.
Frequent loan exhibitions are held in the Tate Gallery.
Other important collections in London are at the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the Public
Record Office Museum, which contains Domesday Book and other famous historical
documents, the London Museum (reopened in Kensington Palace in 1951), where
the collection illustrates the history of the capital, and Hertford House, where the
Wallace Collection (furniture, armour, objets d’art and paintings, mainly French
works of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) is housed.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for the administration of the Victoria
and Albert Museum and the Science Museum.1 The other national collections are
run by Trustee bodies. All are financed from Government funds. Besides meeting
1 For information on the scientific museums, see page 218.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
225
the administrative costs, this finance takes the form of annual purchase grants, which
have recently been substantially increased, and of special ad hoc purchase grants. The
collections may also receive certain pre-eminent works of art acquired by the Treasury
in lieu of estate duty. The buildings are maintained by the Ministry of Works.
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish United
Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which was opened
to the public in i960. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at
St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed. A Northern Irish Folk
Museum has recently been established in Belfast. The Belfast Museum and Art
Gallery is owned and maintained by Belfast Corporation but negotiations are proceed¬
ing for it to be transferred to a statutory body which will receive financial aid from the
Government of Northern Ireland. In addition, a small Belfast art gallery under the
control of CEMA was opened in May i960.
The Government is advised on questions relating to the most effective develop¬
ment of the national institutions as a whole, and on their co-operation with provincial
institutions, by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries, set up in 1931.
The Standing Commission publishes a report every five years.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some wealthy collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in
museums—the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, is the oldest in the
country and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has fine art galleries and a notable
collection of engravings, manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder on his
death in 1861. Other universities have important collections, primarily for teaching
purposes but also open to the public. Other cities with important museums and art
galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester,
Norwich, Southampton, and York where the Castle Museum, with its complete
reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street of shops, offers a most interesting
historical display. The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum at Coventry, the first major
art gallery to be built in the provinces since 1939, was opened in March i960. In
recent years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house museums’, in
which outstanding examples of the private residences of former times have been
taken over by national and municipal authorities for this purpose, as at Temple
Newsam, Leeds; Aston Hall, Birmingham; and the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. Private
art collections are to be seen in the historic family mansions (including many
in the ownership of the National Trust) which are now open to the public at certain
times.
In 1959, the first regional museum service in Britain was inaugurated for the south¬
west. Its objects are to promote closer co-operation between museums and art galleries
in the region, to improve technical facilities, and to provide financial assistance.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the functions of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past thirty years, and at
present expends an average of .£10,000 a year for this purpose.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organisation to
which museums and art galleries and their staffs throughout the country belong;
there are also many overseas members. The association serves as a central body
226
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating to museum
administration, and as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
It also produces directories, a monthly journal, and other publications.
Temporary exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions Bureau,
and the Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, are a regular
feature of many museums.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members and, in winter,
exhibitions usually devoted to national schools of painting; the Royal Scottish
Academy; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Institute of Oil Painters;
The Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal Society of Portrait Painters;
the Women’s International Art Club; and the London Group (all the foregoing are
associations of professional painters); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some
of these societies, notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own
galleries in London. There are, in addition, many regional societies such as the Royal
Ulster Academy of Arts, while an increasing number of amateur art societies through¬
out the United Kingdom hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the
fine arts in a variety of ways. The Contemporary Art Society uses its members’
subscriptions to buy modern works which it presents to the public galleries.
Exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the
year in the galleries of the art dealers of Bond Street and other parts of the West
End of London. The Whitechapel Art Gallery shows a series of important exhibitions
in the East End of London; and the London County Council has shown an exhibition
of modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year since the second world war.
There are also exhibitions of children’s art, including the National Exhibition of
Children’s Art sponsored by the Sunday Pictorial.
Art Education
There are 15 colleges of art in the United Kingdom, each serving a region, all
of which offer courses in most branches of art and a varying range of crafts; and
there are schools of art in nearly all the larger towns. In London, the most notable
of these schools and colleges are the Royal College of Art (a national college) and
the Central School of Arts and Crafts of the London County Council, in both of
which the emphasis is on industrial design, and the Slade School of Fine Arts in
the University of London. At the Royal Academy Schools, founded in 1768, all
instruction is provided free by Royal Academicians.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history of art
are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of Classical
Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg Institute
(also a part of London University) which provides facilities for research on the
character and history of the classical tradition.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society for
Education through Art, among its other activities, encourages the purchase by schools
of original works of art, by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition.
The Arts Council operates a loan scheme for reproductions of works of art which is
used extensively by schools.
Industrial Design
The Council of Industrial Design was set up in 1944 by the President of the Board
of Trade as a grant-aided body with the purpose of promoting the improvement
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
227
of design in the products of British industry. The council has 24 members, a majority
being prominent industrialists, and there is a separate Scottish committee.
The council runs a permanent exhibition, The Design Centre, in the Haymarket,
London. This is a selective, changing display of well-designed British consumer
goods in current production. To supplement this display, an illustrated record of
good design, known as Design Index, is maintained at the centre. A maximum of
20 Design Centre awards are presented annually to the makers of outstanding products
shown in the centre during the previous year. In 1959, an additional annual award
was instituted, the Duke of Edinburgh’s Prize for Elegant Design, presented to the
designer of a single product chosen from the centre. In 1957, a design centre was also
opened in Glasgow. In addition, the council organises conferences, courses and
exhibitions in Britain and overseas, and maintains a record of designers and a photo¬
graphic and reference library on industrial design. It has an education section and a
retail section and publishes a monthly magazine, Design.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of Arts
(see p. 202), the Society of Industrial Artists, which is the representative professional
body in Great Britain of designers engaged in industry and commerce, and the Design
and Industries Association (DIA), founded in 1915. The DIA is a voluntary association
of industrial companies, designers, and other bodies and individuals interested in the
promotion of good design in industry.
Architecture
The Government’s responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned
with encouraging the best in new building and preserving, by legislation and in
other ways, the best that has been inherited from the past.
The Government departments chiefly concerned with domestic architecture are
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Department of Health for
Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government,
which are responsible in their respective countries for approving the layout and
design of local authority housing schemes, and which issue reports and circulars
setting standards for local authority housing. The education departments are responsible
for the supervision of building for the public education service. The Ministry of Works
is the department concerned with the construction and maintenance of Government
buildings and also with the preservation of historic buildings and ancient monuments
in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland responsibility for the preservation of ancient
buildings is vested in the Ministry of Finance. All these departments have architects
on their staffs, as have also the local authorities concerned with housing and planning.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions exist to
further the interests of architecture and the presentation of buildings of aesthetic
value or historic interest.
Several State-sponsored organisations are concerned with special aspects of
architecture. The Royal Fine Art Commission (appointed in 1924) and the Royal
Fine Art Commission for Scotland (appointed in 1927), both bodies of experts
established by Royal Warrant, advise Government departments, planning authorities,
and other public bodies on questions of public amenity or artistic importance; many
large-scale modern buildings have had the approval of the commissions. The National
Buildings Record maintains a library (open to the public for consultation) of over
half a million photographs of English and Welsh architecture and an index of archi¬
tectural records in public and private possession. The Scottish National Buildings
Record, a department of the Ministry of Works in Scotland, carries out functions

similar to those of its English counterpart. The Royal Commissions on Ancient
and Historical Monuments for England, for Wales and Monmouthshire, and for
Scotland, record in detail all ancient and historical remains in their countries and
publish a series of surveys, designed ultimately to cover the whole of Great Britain.
The Ancient Monuments Boards for England, Scotland, and Wales, set up under the
Ancient Monuments Acts, consider which monuments should be listed in accordance
with those Acts and advise the Minister of Works on any questions concerning ancient
monuments. In Northern Ireland the Minister of Finance administers the Ancient
Monuments Acts (Northern Ireland) and is advised by the Ancient Monuments
Advisory Council. The Historic Buildings Councils for England, Scotland, and Wales,
which were constituted under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act,
1953, advise the minister on the provision of grants towards the repair and maintenance
of such buildings and their contents (see p. 191). The Historic Buildings Council for
Scotland also advises the Secretary of State for Scotland on the exercise of his functions
relating to buildings of architectural or historic interest under the planning Acts.
An Historic Buildings Bureau finds new uses for unoccupied historic buildings of
outstanding interest.
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) to which are allied 44 autonomous
architectural societies covering the whole of the United Kingdom and most of the
overseas Commonwealth. The Royal Institute has a membership of 19,000, and some
5,000 students. It has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in
the world, housing over 65,000 books and periodicals and many thousands of drawings.
The RIBA holds an annual conference and is concerned with a wide range of activities
covering professional practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions,
professional and public relations. It arranges lectures, symposia and discussions on a
variety of subjects, presents exhibitions and through its Board of Architectural Educa¬
tion controls the training and examination of architects. The Royal Gold Medal for
Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the recommendation of the RIBA.
Education in architecture is given at 26 Schools of Architecture in the United
Kingdom recognised for exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final examina¬
tions as well as at 15 overseas schools. There are also two Schools of Architecture
in the United Kingdom where the intermediate examination is recognised and one
overseas. In addition, there are 43 schools of art and technical institutes (nine full time)
with facilities for the instruction of intending architects, which prepare students for
taking the external examinations of the RIBA.
It is against the law for any person to practise or carry out work under any name,
style or title containing the word ‘architect’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory
body which regulates registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. The principal professional associations of architects are the Incorporated
Association of Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects, the
Faculty of Architects and Surveyors, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland,
and the Royal Society of Ulster Architects. Other societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of societies interested in particular
aspects of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The Civic Trust, established in 1957, seeks to promote high standards in archi¬
tecture and civic planning and to encourage a wider interest in the appearance of
towns, villages and the countryside. In 1959 the Trust introduced a system of awards
for good architectural design, to be given in two classes; the first for planning develop¬
ments, such as housing estates, the second for smaller projects, for example, shop fronts.

Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group, which is a society
designed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save Georgian buildings
from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; and the National
Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scotland,
which together own more than a hundred houses of historic or architectural interest,
many of which contain pictures and other works of art. Most of these houses, and
other ancestral homes, are open to the public at a small charge and attract large
numbers of visitors. The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was formed in 1952
under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Canterbury, in order to raise £4 million
to supplement the efforts of parishes to put their churches into good repair. By the
end of i959> ^ had made available sums totalling ^430,004 to 987 churches and
chapels of various religious denominations.
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the libraries, by the very large number of private literary
societies (both national and local), by book reviews in the press and on the radio, and
by the numerous periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature, of which
the best-known critical weekly is The Times Literary Supplement. State support for
literature is given through the Arts Council, which assists poetry—especially poetry
readings—in Great Britain. The British Council is active in encouraging a knowledge
of English literature abroad. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the
form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, e.g., the two James
Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys
Memorial prize for young writers of promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative
writing, the Library Association Carnegie Medal for an outstanding book for children,
the Kate Greenaway Medal for the best children’s book illustration and the Somerset
Maugham award for young writers. The Arts Council makes triennial awards for the
best books of poetry published.
Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (more
than 5 million volumes). The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes)
is in Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes). Together
with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (2j million volumes) and the Cambridge Univer¬
sity Library (about 2^ million volumes) these comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the
country and are entitled to receive a copy of each new book published in Britain:
the British Museum Library must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other great libraries include1: the University of London Central Library,2 3 the
libraries of the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews, and Queen’s
University Library, Belfast; London Library (the largest public subscription library)
and the John Rylands Library, Manchester; the Science Museum Library, the

3 million volumes.

Victoria and Albert Museum Art Library and the British Museum (Natural History)
Library; the Patent Office Library, the India Office Library and the Public Record
Office (which contains the non-current records of the superior courts of law and of
most of the Government departments); the libraries of the Royal Institute of Inter¬
national Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Institute,
the Royal Geographical Society, the British Drama League, the Royal Institute of
British Architects, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music;
the Central Music Library; and the National Library for the Blind. The Arts Council
has founded a reference and lending library of modern English poetry, which is
housed with the National Book League. The National Register of Archives, maintained
by the Historical Manuscripts Commission in the Public Record Office building,
contains particulars of numerous local and private records.
The public libraries of Britain maintain a service throughout the country,
administered by 559 public library authorities (county councils, county borough
councils, municipal borough councils, urban district councils and a few parish councils).
Together these authorities provide more than 33,673 service points; they hold over
71 million books and make more than 445 million loans a year. A feature of the service
in rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library. Over a quarter of the
total population are registered members of public libraries.
In addition to lending books, music scores and gramophone records, and providing
special libraries for, among others, children, patients in hospitals and prisoners,
public libraries engage in many other activities, such as play readings, lectures, film
shows, music circles and co-operation in university extension education.
A committee set up by the Minister of Education to examine the structure of the
public library service in England and Wales reported in 1959’ princip^ recommen¬
dations were that every public library authority should have a statutory duty to provide
an efficient library service; that the Minister of Education should have general super¬
visory responsibilities and be assisted by an advisory body in England and Wales;
that non-county borough and urban district councils which cannot satisfy the minister
that they are providing an efficient library service may have their public library powers
withdrawn; that greater co-operation between libraries should be encouraged; and
that libraries should be provided with an increased staff of qualified and specialist
librarians and, in many cases, with new or improved premises. Legislation to implement
these recommendations is under consideration.
A feature of library services in Britain is the co-operation within the network of
libraries which greatly increases the value of the service. Library co-operation is
organised, in the first instance, through regional library bureaux, and is finally
centralised in the National Central Library with its widespread system of outlier
libraries (public, university and special), giving access to a total stock of
some 100 million books and many thousand sets of periodicals. The Scottish Central
Library carries out, in Scotland, functions similar to those of the National
Central Library.
The two principal organisations to which librarians belong are the Library Asso¬
ciation and the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB)
(see p. 222). The Library Association endeavours to unite librarians and governors of
libraries throughout the world and through its many meetings, conferences, personal
service and publications, including its official journal The Library Association Record, to
provide for their general and specialised professional interests.
In addition to the services provided by public libraries, many bookshops maintain
lending libraries for their customers.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 23I
Books
New books constitute the large majority of all books published annually in Britain.
In the five-year period i955~59> f°r example, British publishers issued an average
total of just over 20,500 separate titles each year, of which an annual average of only
some 5)7°° were reprints or new editions. A feature of recent years has been a great
increase in the number of books of all kinds, both original works and new or reprinted
editions, published with paper covers (‘paper backs’).
Some books are produced as Government publications by Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, which is the largest publishing organisation in Britain; the great majority
of books, however, are produced by some 300 of the principal commercial publishers,1
including the university presses, notably the Cambridge University Press and the
Clarendon Press. The Clarendon Press is part of the Oxford University Press, which
also has a publishing department in London.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers^
Association, and the Society of Authors.
Literary and Philological Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its various
forms include: the National Book League, which encourages the reading of and an
interest in books, and which holds exhibitions, including annual exhibitions of book
design, and arranges exhibitions of books in some overseas countries; the English
Association, which aims at upholding the standard of English writing and speech;
and the Royal Society of Literature, which is concerned with the advancement of
literature. The British Academy, which is an organisation concerned with humanistic
studies and has a section dealing with literature and philology, receives a grant
from the Treasury.
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society and by various bodies such
as the Apollo Society and the Company of Nine, which sponsor poetry readings and
recitals. Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including
the National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales, the origins of which
date back to the seventh century—and the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival of Poetry.
The Poetry Book Society will promote a special Festival of Poetry in London in 1961^
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the Biblio¬
graphical Society, the Halleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship. There
are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society and the Poetry
Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new books to their members.
DRAMA
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the Arts Council (in Great
Britain) and CEMA (in Northern Ireland), which grant subsidies to certain theatrical
managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (i.e. using profits to finance
future productions), provided that such managements have given evidence of serious
aims and of consistently high standards of practical competence; and through the
British Council, which is responsible for making the British theatre better known
abroad by organising and sponsoring international tours by important companies
1 For total sales and exports of books in 1959, see p. 357.
232
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
including the Old Vic Theatre Company and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre
Company, and by sending overseas exhibitions of theatrical design and lecturers on
drama. The Treasury is empowered, under the National Theatre Act, 1949, to support
the scheme for a national theatre by contributing .£1 million to the cost of building
and equipping a theatre, in London, which would operate under public auspices.
In 1957, the entertainment duty on the living theatre (which raised about million
of revenue a year) was abolished.
Professional Theatre
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of the professional
theatre is in London, where there are some 40 principal theatres and a number of
suburban theatres. With the exception of four theatres—Covent Garden, Sadler’s
Wells, the Old Vic and the Royal Court—these theatres are let to some 25 producing
managements on a commercial basis for each production. The provincial theatres
are served by productions touring either before or after London presentation, by
companies specially formed for touring, and by local repertory companies. Since
the second world war several theatres in London and about a hundred theatres in the
provinces have been closed. On the other hand, several new theatres have been opened
in recent years, both in London and the provinces. The first theatre to be built in
London for 25 years, the Mermaid Theatre, was opened in 1959, as was the completely
reconstructed Queen’s Theatre, the original of which was destroyed by enemy action
in September 1940; another new London theatre, the Prince Charles Theatre, will
be opened in 1961. The first full-scale theatre to be built by a civic authority since
1939, the Belgrade Theatre, was opened in Coventry in 1958, and smaller theatres
have been opened in Middlesbrough and Whitehaven (Cumberland). A new civic
theatre in Nottingham is to be completed by 1962, others are planned for Guildford
and Leicester, and a festival theatre, with an open stage, is to be built at Chichester
(Sussex).
In addition to managements which rent theatres, there are a number of companies
which produce plays in theatres of their own. Among the best known of these organisa¬
tions are the Old Vic Theatre Company in London and the Shakespeare Memorial
Theatre Company at Stratford-upon-Avon; the latter company celebrated its centenary
in 1959. In 1956, the English Stage Company was established at the Royal Court
Theatre in Sloane Square, London, where it presents contemporary plays. Theatre
Workshop, formed in 1945, has, since 1953, performed classical and contemporary plays
at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, London, some of which have been staged subsequently in
West End theatres. Local repertory companies (many of which are assisted financially
and otherwise by the Arts Council or, in Northern Ireland, by CEMA) may have the
use of their own established repertory theatres, e.g., the Bristol Old Vic Company
at the historic Theatre Royal in Bristol, or they may tour the various towns and
villages in the locality, playing from one to several nights in each place and using any
building which can be made suitable for the purpose. The English Children’s Theatre,
a non-profit-making organisation, presents children’s plays in London and the
provinces, while the Youth Theatre, consisting mainly of schoolboy actors, presents
an annual Shakespearian production. The Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park, London,
has presented many summer seasons of repertory, mainly plays of Shakespeare and
other poetic drama. The Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in Irish drama;
the Belfast Arts Theatre, specialising in international drama, is to become the Belfast
Arts Theatre Trust and move to a new building before the end of i960, and Irish
plays will also be presented. Both these theatres are subsidised by CEMA. Inevitably,
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
233
the work of repertory companies varies in quality but, generally speaking, the standard
of both production and acting is high; many of the leading dramatists, producers,
actors and actresses in the United Kingdom started their careers in repertory.
Theatre clubs for regular patrons are run in connection with some of the company-
owned theatres. Where seats are sold only to theatre club members (e.g., the Arts
Theatre, London), the plays are not subject to the normal requirement that they
must be passed by the Lord Chamberlain1 before presentation.
The Theatres Act, 1843, which deals with the licensing of theatres and plays,
requires all new plays to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain, who may forbid
the presentation of any play ‘for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of
the public peace’. The number of plays for which a licence is refused amounts to
under one per cent of the total submitted.
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organisations which exist to maintain the stan¬
dards of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safe¬
guard the welfare of those who work in it. Organisations of this kind include the
London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West
End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory
Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of Dramatists.
The trade union of theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and
Kine Employees.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the history
and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre Institute has a British
centre in London. Its headquarters are in Paris and there are 40 member countries.
The main purpose of the institute is to foster international goodwill and understanding
by interchange of students, theatrical companies, theatre personnel and all theatrical
information. The British centre’s committee is composed of representatives of the
Arts Council, British Council, League of British Dramatists, British Drama League,
Conference of Repertory Theatres and representatives of the theatre.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are thousands of amateur dramatic societies, with an active membership of
some half a million. The movement is sponsored and fostered by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by five special organisations—the British
Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations, the Scottish
Community Drama Association, the Ulster Drama League and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals.
The British Drama League, which was founded in 1919, operates on a basis of
affiliation and individual membership. Its many services to its members include the
arrangement of courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; the provision
of a library, which has the largest collection in Britain of plays and books on the
theatre, and an information bureau; and advice on many matters connected with
the stage, e.g., play-writing, production, stage management and the organisation of
drama festivals. The work of the standing conference is mainly that of co-ordination
between the various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic movement. Functions
similar to those of the league and the conference in England and Wales are fulfilled
1 The Lord Chamberlain, whose office dates from the fourteenth century, is the senior officer
of the royal household.
234
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in Scotland by the Scottish Community Drama Association, which receives some
financial assistance from the Scottish Education Department.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have famous dramatic societies, and
there are drama clubs and societies in many other universities and colleges.
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is provided mainly in the dramatic schools and institutions
of all kinds which have been established throughout the United Kingdom. Among
the most important of such institutions are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(which was founded in 1904 and is now grant-aided by the Treasury, and which
provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School of
Speech Training and Dramatic Art, the Rose Bruford School and the London
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, all of which are in or near London; and the
Old Vic School in Bristol.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many schools and youth
clubs in Britain, and a varying degree of recognition is given to the subject in the
universities. Bristol University created a department of drama offering a course
which an arts student may take as part of a general degree course; in July 1959, Bristol
inaugurated the first International Festival of University Theatre to be held in Britain.
FILMS
The British public possibly visits the cinema more frequently than any other
people in the world. Although cinema attendance has been declining in recent years
(attendances at cinemas in the United Kingdom dropped from 1,101 million in 1956
to 603 million in 1959) and the average number of cinemas in Great Britain decreased
by about 840 between 1956 and 1959, there were, at the beginning of i960, about 3,450
cinemas in Great Britain (with a total of 3-3 million seats) and another 138 cinemas
in Northern Ireland. In February 1959, the first new cinema to be built in the West
End of London for 20 years was opened.
About 10 per cent of British first feature films are made by, and some 35 per cent
distributed by the two large amalgams, the Rank Organisation and the Associated
British Picture Corporation, which have companies for production, distribution
and exhibition. Most producers who are independent of either group make films in
association with other film distributors. There are numerous companies (many of
them small) which produce short films.
Cinematograph films were first shown to the public in Britain in 1896, and within
ten years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did
not survive the impact of the first world war and, since 1914, British films have had
to contend at home as well as abroad with keen American competition.
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality
and began again to exert an important influence on film development by the production
of many notable feature films depicting Britain’s ordeals and achievements. These
films were based on the documentary technique which had been developed in Britain
from the early 1930s. British feature films in the post-war years were influenced
by this trend, and realistic treatment became a characteristic of British feature
production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted satirical comedies that
won international acclaim.
In recent years, this talent for realism has been successfully employed in feature
films reflecting current social problems and in those based on war experiences. Britain
is once again in the forefront of film production and London is one of the most
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
235
important centres for the making of films for international markets. British films,
actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated abroad as well as at home and
regularly achieve success at international film events. British films are widely distributed
abroad and export earnings are an important part of total earnings. The British Film
Producers Association and the Federation of British Film Makers are the two trade
associations to which many feature film producers belong.
The documentary film tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to
1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and
imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial organisations.
The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then, British documentary
technicians have continued to produce high quality factual films which have
won a number of awards at the major international film festivals. An interesting
recent development has been the attempt to re-interpret the documentary tradition
in contemporary terms by a group of young technicians—the Free Cinema movement
—and by the television film units of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the
Independent Television Authority contractors.
The Government has continued to sponsor a wide range of information films.
These are produced through the Films Division of the Central Office of Information
(COI), which commissions their production by the private companies belonging
to the Association of Specialised Film Producers (a national body) and to the newsreel
and television organisations. They include documentary films produced to inform
audiences overseas about life in Britain and social and cultural progress. These, and
other films acquired from private industry and public bodies, are distributed through¬
out the world by British Information Services, in English and in as many as 17 other
language versions.
The films produced by the COI for Government departments have included
many specialised films on science, agriculture, health and industry. Films for industry,
produced by the Government, the British Productivity Council and private firms,
have helped to increase productivity; to the same end, many hundreds of industrial
films from other countries have been evaluated, and the best of them made available
to industrial audiences through the COFs Central Film Library1 and other agencies.
Since 1958, the Films in the Service of Industry festivals, held at Harrogate in
Yorkshire, have provided a valuable meeting place for specialists in the production
and use of films.
The Films of Scotland Committee, set up in 1936 and revived in 1954 by the
Scottish Council (Development and Industry) in consultation with the Secretary
of State for Scotland, promotes the production of Scottish films covering the industries
and cultural traditions of Scotland.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute,
founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant. The institute
encourages the making and showing of good films and helps the public to appreciate
good films. It administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National
Film Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film distribution library
from which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. The institute also makes grants to the Scottish Film Council, the Scientific
Film Association, the University Film Council and the Society of Film Teachers,
and administers a fund for the production of experimental films.
1 The Central Film Library also makes available on hire to schools, colleges and other institutions
films on many specialised subjects.

The National Film Archive contains over 7,000 films, excluding newsreels and other
miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and 150,000 photographic
stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the film and as significant social
and historical records.
The National Film Theatre shows films of outstanding historical, artistic or
technical interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes
which are unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of
the films shown. Its present building, erected on the south bank of the Thames, in
London, in 1957, is the first permanent national film theatre in the world.
The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in December 1958, has as its
aim to improve the standard of film and television production and to stimulate
public appreciation of the arts. It was formed by the amalgamation of the British
Film Academy (founded in 1947 as a private organisation, representative of senior
film-makers, to foster the making of creative films) and the Guild of Television
Producers and Directors, with which the British Film Academy’s aims and
activities were closely linked.
Assistance to British Film Producers
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and well-being, and needs adequate financial
backing combined with freedom for the film-maker to experiment and to express
his own ideas. There is no State-owned film production unit in Britain, but the
National Film Finance Corporation, a statutory body set up in 1949, is empowered
to lend money for film production. Its members—a chairman, a managing director
and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds (limited
by statute to £8 million) are provided up to £6 million by advances from the Board
of Trade; the remaining £2 million may be borrowed from non-Governmental
sources. The corporation is financially concerned with about half the first feature
films being made in British studios.
There is a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund. This
levy is quite separate from the entertainments duty (abolished in i960) which was a
tax charged on cinema admissions. The money raised by the levy is paid out as a per¬
centage of a film’s takings, so that the more successful a film is at the box office, the
more it receives from the fund. The fund was started in September 1950 on a non-
statutory basis as the British Film Production Fund, known as the Eady Fund. It
was based on a renewable agreement between the various trade associations, subject
to Board of Trade approval. When this agreement lapsed in October 1957, the voluntary
scheme -was replaced by a statutory scheme with the same purpose. The Cinematograph
Films Act, 1957, gave the President of the Board of Trade powers to make regulations
governing the collection, by the Board of Customs and Excise, of a levy from exhibitors,
and the distribution of the proceeds for the benefit of British film production. The
British Film Fund Agency undertakes the distribution.
To help British films meet the keen American competition, legislation passed in
1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent legislation), under
which a certain proportion of British films must be shown in British cinemas each
year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade annually after consultation with
the Cinematograph Films Council, any change being effected by statutory instrument
approved by both Houses of Parliament. For first feature films it has stood at 30
per cent since 1950.

Cinema Licensing and Film Censorship
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but, by virtue of
their power to grant licences, the local licensing authorities act as the final arbiters
of films proposed for showing in their areas. There are over 700 licensing authorities;
they are local authorities or, in some areas, magistrates. The Cinematograph Act
of 1909 required, for reasons of safety, that inflammable films should be shown only
on premises licensed for the purpose; it was subsequently established that licensing
authorities had the right to supervise the character of the films exhibited. In judging
the suitability of films for public showing, licensing authorities rely on the judgment
of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to which are submitted
all films (other than newsreels) intended for public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of the
cinema industry, which wished to ensure that a proper standard was maintained
in the films offered to the public. It consists of a president, a secretary, and five
examiners; the latter, who include two women, are appointed by the president.
The president is elected by a trade committee and is usually a man prominent in
public life.
The board, which does not use any written code of censorship, may require cuts
to be made before it will grant a certificate to a film; more rarely, it will refuse a
certificate. Films passed by the board are placed in one of three categories: ‘U’
(suitable for universal showing); ‘A’ (more suitable for adults than children) and
‘X’ (suitable only for adults). A child or young person under 16 years of age may be
admitted to a cinema showing an ‘A’ film only if accompanied by a responsible adult,
and may not be admitted on any condition if an ‘X’ film is being shown.
Children and the Cinema
The Cinematograph Act, 1952, which came into force in January 1956, extended
the scope of the 1909 Act and provided for the making of regulations by the Home
Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children in relation to their attendance
at film shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from
the licensing authority and the authority is able to impose special conditions on
such cinemas. The British Board of Film Censors publishes at intervals a list of
films particularly suitable for children and for exhibition at children’s matinees.
One of the women examiners is appointed for her special knowledge of children’s needs.
Children’s cinema clubs, providing special children’s programmes on Saturday
mornings, are widely organised by the cinema groups and have become very popular.
An important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film
Foundation, which produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed
for children. The foundation is a non-profit-making body set up by the British film
industry in 1951 and provision is made in the Cinematograph Films Act, I957> f°r
the foundation to receive grants from the British Film Fund Agency.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and music
festivals, orchestral concerts, choral singing, brass bands, opera and ballet are
important features of British cultural life.
Tours abroad by British orchestras, soloists, and opera and ballet companies are
sometimes assisted financially by the British Council, which sponsors some record¬
ings of works by British composers, and maintains libraries of British music (scores
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
238
and records) in about 70 countries overseas. At the Council’s London headquarters
a reference library of records, scores, and books on music is maintained, and musicians
from abroad are sometimes invited to Britain as the Council’s guests, to gain first¬
hand experience of British music-making.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large towns
and cities of Britain, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the
principal concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames,
which was opened in 1951 in connection with the Festival of Britain; the Royal
Albert Hall, Kensington, where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts
is given; and the Wigmore Hall, which is the principal recital centre.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony, the BBC
Symphony, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic, the Philharmonia,
the Halle (Manchester), the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony, the BBC Northern, the Scottish National
and the BBC Scottish. There are also the specialised string and chamber orchestras
such as the Philomusica of London and the London Mozart Players; and a number
of new orchestras which have been formed during the past few years. Many of these
receive financial aid from the Arts Council and local authorities to help with the cost
of maintaining ensembles, of presenting new or unfamiliar works, and of improving
standards generally. The City of Belfast Orchestra is financed jointly by the Belfast
Corporation and the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA).
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, the Bach Choir, and, in Northern Ireland, the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. These and many other choral societies are associated with
famous orchestras in major choral works; most of them, together with hundreds of
similar choral and orchestra societies and music clubs, are affiliated to the National
Federation of Music Societies, through which they are supported with funds provided by
the Arts Council. Membership of the National Federation has risen to some 800 societies.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held annually
in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in existence for over
200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and festivals
of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns throughout
the United Kingdom. They range from the famous Edinburgh International Festival
of Music and Drama, which lasts three weeks and attracts many thousands of visitors,
to those, such as the King’s Lynn Festival, lasting a week or less. Among the better
known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales; the Llangollen International
Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year;
the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; the Aldeburgh
Festival; the York Mystery Plays and Festival; and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals
of choral music, which are held on a triennial basis. An annual international festival
of folk song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is increasing. It is encouraged by the work of
County Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The Rural Music
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
239
Schools Association is concerned with music-making by amateurs in country districts;
it brings together professional musicians, teachers, administrators and amateurs.
Professional organisations, which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Composers’
Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Specialised education in music is given at colleges of music, of which the most
prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in
London, the Royal Manchester College, and the Royal Scottish Academy in Glasgow,
all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are also the Trinity College of Music, and the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, both in London, and the School of Music in
Birmingham. Youth orchestras are strongly encouraged, and children’s concerts,
given by symphony orchestras directed by prominent conductors, are a regular feature
of the country’s musical activities and have helped to develop among the youth of the
community an appreciation of the world’s greatest music. The National Youth
Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, made up of the most promising
members of school orchestras are noted for their high standard of performance, and
so is the London Schools’ Symphony Orchestra. A ‘Youth and Music’ organisation,
affiliated to the continental ‘Jeunesses Musicales’, was established in 1954 to encourage
musical education and orchestras in schools. The Students’ Orchestra of Great
Britain, specially formed in 1958 and 1959 from music students for performances
abroad, has achieved great successes.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and about
115,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the examinations of
the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest proportion (over
82,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The increase in musical appreciation among the general public during recent
years is shown not only by the size of the audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music, but also by the fact that, of the 78 million gramophone records sold each
year, the proportion of classical music is about one-fifth. The National Federation
of Gramophone Societies has some 370 affiliated societies.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library in its Buckingham Palace
Road library building, and many other public libraries have collections of music that
can be borrowed; some of them also lend out gramophone records.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London, which is leased by the Government1 to the Covent Garden Opera
Trust, which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a
national opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts
Council, amounting to 43 per cent of its expenditure, subject to a maximum of
£500,000 in any one year. The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company
and ballet company which give performances both in London and elsewhere. The
opera company, which numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes an
annual tour of provincial centres. The ballet company, which in January 1957 was
incorporated with the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School
to form the Royal Ballet, has a high international reputation gained in many overseas
tours since 1945.
1 The Ministry of Works acquired a 42-year lease from Covent Garden Properties Limited
in 1949.
240
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in London;
a second Sadler’s Wells opera company has been formed to tour opera in the provinces.
At Glyndebourne in Sussex, an opera season, for which a company is specially
assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include the English Opera
Group, formed in 1947, and noted for its performances of operas by Benjamin Britten;
the New Opera Company, formed in 1957 by members of the Cambridge Opera
Group to produce new operas in London and give opportunities to promising amateurs
and young professionals; the Handel Opera Society; the Intimate Opera Company,
which performs works for very small casts in any hall available; and the Welsh National
Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the Grand Opera Society
of Northern Ireland. The Arts Council manages a small operatic group (Opera for All)
which specialises in introducing opera to audiences in small towns who hitherto
have been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of amateur opera clubs in London
and the provinces and in Northern Ireland. Among the ballet companies are the Ballet
Rambert, Britain’s oldest ballet company, which has discovered many distinguished
dancers and choreographers, London’s Festival Ballet and an important new group,
Western Theatre Ballet, that includes a large proportion of contemporary works in
its repertoire. The work of the Irish Ballet in Northern Ireland combines traditional
dancing and mime.
The Royal (formerly Sadler’s Wells), the Arts Educational, and the Rambert Ballet
Training Schools and the Royal Academy of Dancing are among the teaching
institutions which have played an important part in raising British ballet to its
present high standard.
IX. THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The United Kingdom ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world,
with about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, with about 2 per
cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks ninth. In density of population it is fourth:
of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands are more crowded;
and there are nine times as many people to the square mile in the United Kingdom
as in the United States. In world trade, it ranks second, accounting for about one-
tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth of the world’s exports of primary products, and
provides nearly one-fifth of the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
The United Kingdom, from its own soil, provides only half of the food it needs;
and—apart from coal and some low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter, fodder
grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return, it is one of the
world’s largest exporters of ships, aircraft, locomotives, motor vehicles, electrical
equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. Few countries in the
world have such a high proportion of the population living in towns (80 per cent)
or such a small proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture (only
slightly more than 4 per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an area with
a quarter of the world’s population. Many countries outside the sterling area use
sterling in their international transactions, and it is the currency in which about
two-fifths of the world’s trade is conducted.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world manu¬
facturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support a rapidly
increasing population at a rising standard of living. It was Britain’s commerce in
cotton goods, above all, which gave it the leading position in world trade; cotton
cloth provided 40 per cent of its exports in 1851. It was in this period also that the
country became so largely dependent on imports: it has been estimated1 that retained
imports, which were only 12 per cent of net national income at factor cost (i.e. cost
after discounting the effect of indirect taxes and subsidies) in 1820, rose to 28 per cent
in 1870. (The 1959 figure was 20 per cent.)
The period from 1870 to 1890 marked the peak of British industrial expansion
as compared with that of other countries. Between 1890 and i9I4 growing industrial
competition from Europe and North America began to make itself felt, but its effects
on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by
the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand for British textiles from India
and other eastern countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
1 Prof. E. A. G. Robinson, Economic Journal, September 1954, p. 458.
241
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth century
became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan, where
labour costs were lower, established themselves firmly in the large eastern markets,
to a great extent replacing the higher-priced and often higher quality British product.
The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by the increasing use
of oil, while coal from the newer European mines competed severely with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of industries
(e.g., locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world demand fell away after a
brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of the
expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products (e.g., cars and electrical
goods). Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some sought deliber¬
ately to protect nascent and even established industries by sheltering them behind
tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a
fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export markets
led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton, iron and
steel, and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy unemployment,
the general rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the years 1921-39, reaching a peak
of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its worst. In districts
relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was much higher.
After 1932, an improvement in the levels of production and employment took
place, stimulated by an increase in home investment, by some revival in world trade
and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial
maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in considerable alterations in Britain’s
financial and trading position. These included the sale of £1,000 million worth of
overseas investments, nearly half in North America, and the accumulation of new
external debts of £3,000 million. Exports had fallen by 1944 as a result of the war
effort to less than one-third of their 1938 volume while there had been a sharp adverse
movement in the terms of trade as a result of the shortage of imported raw materials.
Post-war Developments
Since the war, the United Kingdom has experienced, with few interruptions, a
steady growth in output of goods and services and a high level of employment.
Invention and technological advance have combined with adaptation to shifts in
world demand to produce some radical changes in the British industrial scene.
Industries in which new techniques have predominated, notably the electrical
engineering, aircraft, motor and chemicals industries, and new branches of
machinery construction, are now contributing a significantly larger share of the
total output—itself much expanded—and providing wider employment opportunities
for an increasingly skilled labour force and a growing contribution to exports. Expendi¬
ture on industrial and scientific research has increased steadily and facilities for
technological education have been greatly enlarged.
At the same time, the United Kingdom has had to deal with some persistent
economic problems; in particular, to fulfil its overseas obligations and to maintain
its traditional role in world commerce and finance it has needed to achieve and
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

maintain a substantial balance of payments surplus, and to curtail the almost con¬
tinuous rise in internal prices. In the initial post-war years Marshall Aid and loans
from the United States and Canada helped to overcome the serious deficit in the
balance of payments pending the full recovery of exports. The strong expansion
in exports in later years which resulted in a substantial surplus in the balance of pay¬
ments enabled import controls to be gradually relaxed. It was, however, only in 1958
that the surplus reached a level fully commensurate with Britain’s external obligations;
in 1959, the surplus was considerably smaller.
A persistent rise in prices was a feature of the post-war years until 1958. It stemmed
primarily from an excessive pressure of demand on the nation’s resources—exports,
investment both at home and abroad, defence, and personal consumption—so that
money incomes rose faster than production. Stability of prices is a main aim of
Government economic policy. Since 1958, prices have remained relatively stable, and
in 1959 and i960 it proved possible to bring about a significant increase in output
without impairing price stability, while the world-wide expansion of activity ensured
a high level of demand for United Kingdom exports.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of the national income
and expenditure of the United Kingdom in recent years, with particular reference to
two problems—the balance of payments and the prevention of inflation. The
sources of Tables 8 to 12 are National Income and Expenditure, 1959, and Economic
Survey, i960, Cmnd. 976.
National Income and Employment
Between 1948 and 1959, the United Kingdom gross national product (the measure
of total goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is estimated
to have doubled from £10,446 million to £20,831 million. In real terms, that is after
allowing for price changes, the increase has amounted to about 33 per cent over the
same period; this is equivalent to an average annual advance of about 2f per cent.
From 1956 to 1958, the need to restrain demand in order to check rising prices and
safeguard the balance of payments reduced the rate of increase, but in 1959 and again
in i960 there was a strong resumption of the upward movement. In comparison with
other countries, the United Kingdom’s national income per head is appreciably below
that of the United States and Canada and ranks slightly below that of Australia, New
Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland.
Table 8 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services, at current
prices, divided between consumers, public authorities, investment and exports;
while the diagrams on p. 244 show the changes in national expenditure in 1959 com¬
pared with 1954 at average 1954 prices, and production and national income trends
since 1900.
Manufacturing industry contributes nearly 40 per cent to the total output of
goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, building and contracting
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up over half the total; agriculture,
forestry and fisheries account for less than 5 per cent, transport and communications,
together with the distributive trades, for slightly more than 20 per cent.
Output in the economy as a whole has increased by nearly a third since 1948.
Industrial production—accounting for about half of total output—has risen over the
twelve years by two-fifths, and in the five years from 1954 I959 ab°ut 14 per

cent in manufacturing industry. There has been an appreciable improvement in
living standards, the proportion of the national resources devoted to investment has
been raised progressively to record levels, and a large expansion in exports has been

achieved. Defence expenditure has been heavy, and in peak years absorbed nearly
10 per cent of the gross national product. In real terms, between 1948 and 1959, gross
fixed capital formation rose by nearly 67 per cent, consumption by 27 per cent, and
public authorities’ current expenditure by over 27 per cent.
The total working population has risen relatively slowly; in the twelve years to the
middle of i960 it increased by about million (or some 7 per cent) to about 24-8
million. The expansion of the national income over the same period has, therefore,
been mainly the result of higher productivity. During this period unemployment
remained very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working population being
out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two world wars, and only once
since 1947—at the end of 1958—has the total in Great Britain exceeded 500,000.
When resources were stretched to the utmost, as for example, in 1951 and again in
1955, the number of unfilled vacancies was double that of registered unemployed.
There are, however, districts in which unemployment is persistently higher than
average, and in i960 the Government acquired additional powers to steer new industrial
development towards such areas.
Investment
Since the end of the war gross fixed investment has risen markedly, particularly
since 1953. In 1938, fixed investment in the United Kingdom wras about 12J per
cent of the gross national product; in 1948, 14 per cent. From 1957 to 1959, it averaged
over 17 per cent. Up to 1953, investment in oil refineries, chemicals, and iron and steel,
and in the housing programmes of local authorities increased particularly rapidly.
Since 1954, industrial investment as a whole, and especially in manufacturing, transport
and communications, and distribution, has risen to record levels, while investment in
housing has declined. In 1959, the volume of fixed capital formation by manufacturing
industry although 14 per cent higher than in 1954, was at its lowest for several years,
but investment plans in hand suggested that expenditures in i960 might exceed the
1957 peak.
More than 40 per cent of the total fixed investment is carried out by the central
Government, the local authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting
for slightly more than two-fifths of public investment, and the central Government
for about one-sixth. Increases in public investment are in progress, and it is estimated
that total expenditure under this head in 1960-61 will amount to £1,730 million,
an increase of about £285 million, or one-fifth over the actual level of 1958-59. The

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
247
Savings and the Financing of Investment
The marked growth of investment since 1954 has been made possible by a sub¬
stantial expansion of personal savings (see Table 10). During the early post-war
years, personal savings were very small, partly because people were making good the
war-time arrears of expenditure on necessities such as clothing and household goods;
most of the saving, therefore, was carried out by the Government through its Budget
surpluses and by companies. But the next few years brought a remarkable growth in
private savings, which in 1959 reached the peak total of £1,450 million net, more
than double the 1954 level and equivalent to 36 per cent of total savings. In the period
1948-5 ^ on average only about 2 per cent of disposable personal income was saved,
but by 1959 the proportion had risen to about 9 per cent.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. A substantial volume has
come from life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings such as
superannuation funds. The National Savings movement (which in 1959 reached the
record peace-time level of £394 million) and building societies (the trend towards house
purchase by means of mortgages reflecting the growth of private house ownership)
have also been significant sources of savings.

Public Authorities
Expenditure by the central Government, local authorities and the National Insurance
funds has expanded appreciably in comparison with pre-war years. The main factors
in this trend have been the growth of the social services and, particularly since 1952,
a high level of defence expenditure. The latter after being held at around £1,550
million for several years is to be increased in 1960-61; it accounted for about 20 per
cent of the expenditure of the public authorities in 1959 against 27 per cent in 1953.
Government current expenditure (excluding National Insurance funds) as a percentage
of the gross national product has dropped from 31 per cent in 1948 to 26 per cent
in 1959.
The expansion of the national income has enabled tax revenue to increase by over
one-quarter since 1953, despite several reductions in taxation.

Personal Incomes and Consumer Expenditure
Incomes from employment in 1959 totalled £13,864 million (compared with £9,112
million in 1952) and accounted for about 70 per cent of total personal incomes against
60 per cent in 1938; for rent, dividends and interest the corresponding percentages
are 11^ and 22^. The diagram below shows the composition of personal incomes
and expenditure in 1959. About one-third of all incomes after tax are in the £250 to

£499 a year range, and a further one-third in the next range, £500 to £749. Incomes
°f j£2>000 and more a year accounted for only 4 per cent of aggregate personal income
after tax.
Consumer expenditure has risen steadily in real terms, i.e. after discounting the
effect of price changes. By 1948* it had reached approximately the same total volume
as in 1938. In 1959, consumer expenditure was over 27 per cent higher than in 1948;
and 13 per cent higher than in 1954 (as shown in Table 12), including an increase
of 4 per cent over 1958. The principal long-term trend is the marked rise in outlays on
motor vehicles and, to a lesser extent, on other durable goods. In 1959, these two groups
accounted for 9 per cent of consumer expenditure, and for about one-third of the total
increase over the previous year. The proportion spent on food, where the trend is
towards greater consumption of both higher quality and pre-packaged foodstuffs, is
fairly constant at slightly under one-third of the total.

Incomes and Prices
Between 1945 and the middle of 1958, the cost of living in the United Kingdom
rose almost without interruption, though at varying rates of increase. The most
rapid rise in retail prices, roughly 10 per cent, was between 1950 and 1951; the lowest,
about 2 per cent, between 1953 and 1954. In the two years to the middle of i960,
however, the retail price index remained stable. The wholesale price index, partly as a
result of the lower costs of imports, has shown only a slight rate of increase since 1954.
Over the period 1948 to 1959, the rise in retail prices was between 50 and 60 per cent.
Wage rates over the same period rose by about 75 per cent and average weekly industrial
earnings have about doubled.
In the first six years after the war, the general upward movement of costs and prices
was in part the result of the rapid increase in import prices, no less than 50 per cent
between 1948 and 1951, although controls held in check the extent of the upward
trend in food and some other prices. This upward trend continued, however, after
1951, although import prices fell. Over the whole period since the war, it is clear that
250
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the main immediate cause of the rise in prices has been the tendency of money incomes
to rise faster than production.
Steps have been taken by the United Kingdom Government throughout the period
to counter this gradual inflation. The main weapons used since 1955 have been the
prevention of excessive demand by monetary measures and appeals for voluntary
restraint in increases in wages and profits. The rapid growth of money incomes con¬
tinued until 1957 and has contributed, at times, to lack of confidence in, and occasional
speculation against, sterling.
In the autumn of 1957, severe measures, including an increase in the Bank rate to
7 per cent, were taken to halt the upward drift in costs and prices. Confidence in
sterling was restored, and during 1958 wages and salaries rose less than in previous
years. In 1959, a policy of expansion again became feasible, and the second half of
the year saw a sharp growth in business activity without any upward movement
in prices.
During the first half of i960 the economy was in a more secure position than for
some years. The lengthening of order books and the almost full utilisation of industrial
capacity, combined with increasing overseas commitments, however, caused the
authorities to impose monetary restrictions, by way of increases in Bank rate, controls
on the rate of expansion of bank advances and on hire purchase transactions, in order
to curb any excessive growth in demand.
Overseas Trade and Payments
The overseas trade of the United Kingdom has undergone a radical transformation
since 1945. Exports have expanded rapidly: the pre-war volume was almost regained
in 1946; since then it has doubled. At the same time both the commodity composition
of exports and their geographical distribution has changed. The engineering and
vehicles industries, in which there has been a rapid development of new processes
and products, in 1959 provided 44 per cent of total exports, compared with an average
of 20 per cent in 1935-38 and 38 per cent in 1954. The proportion of exports going
to North America has been raised from 10 per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent in 1959.
Between 1954 and 1959, the volume of imports rose by 22 per cent and that of exports
by 16 per cent, while the terms of trade (the relation of export prices to import prices),
became more favourable, without, however, restoring the 1938 relationship. Invisible
earnings from shipping, commerce, the tourist trade, investment income and other
sources have also improved considerably, and the net surplus on current account in
1958 amounted to £349 million; it also included the first surplus on visible trade since
the war and probably for many years before 1939, amounting to £98 million.
The United Kingdom needs a substantial surplus on external current account,
sufficient not only to meet all its overseas commitments and obligations (including
the repayment of the North American post-war loans), but also to maintain and
increase long-term investment overseas, particularly in the Commonwealth. Tradition¬
ally, Britain has been a heavy exporter of capital and, since 1945, despite severe
burdens on resources strained by war, the outflow has been maintained at a high
level. In the years 1954-59, net long-term overseas investment has averaged more than
£200 million a year, or over 1 per cent of the national income. Moreover, the United
Kingdom has recently undertaken to raise substantially its assistance to the economically
less developed countries, and this may require about £150 million in 1960-61.
It is also necessary to improve the external monetary position, that is to say, the
ratio of gold and foreign currency reserves to external liabilities. In 1958, rapid
progress was made in building up the reserves, which increased by £284 million.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
251
In the following year they fell by ^119 million, although during the year payments in
gold to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and for the repayment of the Export-
Import Bank loan amounted to ^220 million. Overseas liabilities to other countries,
in the form of sterling balances, rose by £146 million to £3,499 million. At the end of
June i960, the reserves stood at £1,033 million.
The renewed strength of sterling was underlined by the introduction, at the end of
i958, of convertibility for current account sterling held by non-residents, and by the
absence of any adverse movements against sterling in the foreign exchange markets
as a result of steps by the United Kingdom, during the latter part of 1959, to abolish
almost all the remaining quota restrictions on imports and controls on other current
external payments.
X. INDUSTRY
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised. Eleven people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every
one in agriculture. The United Kingdom is one of the world’s largest exporters of
manufactured goods per head of population and the range of its industrial manufactures
reflects its position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
Location
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many and
various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century, one of the
most important influences was the proximity of coal, the major source of power,
particularly when it was associated with ease of access to other raw materials such
as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for chemicals) in Cheshire, and to the coast
which in turn offered easy access to imported raw materials and a quick outlet for
exports. In the course of the past hundred years, the pull exercised by coal has been
progressively weakened as improved means of communication and an alternative
source of power in electricity have been developed and have enabled advantage to
be taken of other sites—e.g., those near to big consumer markets and plentiful supplies
of labour. During the inter-war period there was a tendency for the ‘new’ industries
such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber products to
develop rapidly in the south (especially in and around Greater London) and in the
Midlands. On the other hand, this period was one of acute depression and mass
unemployment for the older industrial areas which specialised in the great staple
industries—coalmining, steel, shipbuilding, marine engineering and cotton manu¬
facture. These conditions prompted official action (which has been intensified since
the second world war) aimed at encouraging the development and diversification of
industry in the areas where labour and other unused resources are to be found (see
p. 256), and discouraging further industrialisation in congested areas such as Greater
London and Greater Birmingham. A considerable expansion and diversification of
industry has, in fact, taken place in these areas as a result of these policies, allied to the
war-time dispersal of industry and the widespread demand for new factory premises
over the past decade.
The main areas of industrial concentration are still, with one exception (London),
the areas which saw the beginning of Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with
two exceptions (London and Belfast), are on or near coalfields; but, particularly
since the first world war, many smaller and more widely dispersed centres of industry
have grown up, notably in southern England. A brief description of the location of
British industry, grouped according to broad geographical areas, is given below.
Greater London and the South-eastern Region
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary, is Britain’s
capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s most important
financial centre, and one of the world’s three largest cities (with Tokyo and New
252
INDUSTRY
253
York) and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New York and Rotterdam). The
geographical region of Greater London (see p. 15), including the urbanised areas
within 40 to 45 miles of Charing Cross, has a working population of over 5 million,
of whom nearly a half are in manufacturing industry. London is the main centre in
Britain of the clothing and food and drink industries, of printing, of cinema film
production, and of the manufacture of furniture, materials for the arts, precision
instruments and many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in all these
industries and the average size of manufacturing firms is well below the national
average (particularly in the County of London). London, especially its outer ring, is also
an important area for light engineering and chemicals and has some heavy engineering
plants. Towards the periphery of the London conurbation and in the new urban
development outside it, industry, particularly the electronics and a variety of con¬
sumer goods industries, has been expanding rapidly; some of the largest aircraft
plants are in this area, as well as the factories of two of the five main motor vehicle
manufacturers. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil
refineries as well as shipyards and a variety of other engineering works.
West and South-west England
The largest city, Bristol, is both a leading port and an industrial centre with aircraft,
tobacco, food processing, paper, paint and other industries. Gloucester has aircraft
and engineering plants. Swindon, in Wiltshire, has railway and engineering works. The
port of Southampton is served by the largest passenger liners and has ship repair
yards, oil refineries and other industries. Plymouth has an important naval dockyard
and several light industries. The west of England is also noted for its wool cloths.
East Anglia and Lincolnshire
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern counties
possess some sizeable towns. Ipswich and Grantham are renowned for agricultural
machinery and implements, and Norwich for footwear and food manufacture. Food
canning and freezing, based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly.
Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire, is an important steel-making centre, and the ports of
Grimsby and Yarmouth have extensive fish processing plants.
Midlands
The main industrial area of the Midlands consists of the great conurbation centred
on Birmingham and Wolverhampton (which includes portions of Staffordshire,
Worcestershire and Warwickshire) where there is a wide variety of industry, including
notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all kinds,
and also jewellery, rubber products and domestic metalware. The smaller conurbation
of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent, is devoted chiefly to the manu¬
facture of pottery and china and to coalmining. The largest concentration of motor
vehicle manufacture in the United Kingdom is situated in the Midlands at Coventry
and Birmingham and, further to the south, near Oxford.
Industrial cities and towns lying outside the main industrial area include Leicester
(hosiery, clothing, footwear and footwear machinery), Derby (general engineering,
locomotives, aero engines), Nottingham (light engineering, lace, drugs, tobacco),
Rugby (electrical engineering), Northampton (footwear, engineering) and Kidder¬
minster (carpets). Corby, in Northamptonshire, has an expanding steel industry
originally based on local deposits of iron ore, and at Peterborough there are several large
engineering works. The richest coalfield in Britain lies in the north-west of the area
and continues into Yorkshire.
254
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Lancashire
Besides being the commercial hub of the cotton textile industry, Manchester is
one of the chief centres of electrical and heavy engineering, machine tools and dye¬
stuffs in Britain. Most of the cotton yarn is spun in Bolton, Oldham, and Rochdale,
and at Stockport (in Cheshire); further to the north lie the weaving towns of Burnley,
Nelson, Blackburn, Colne, Accrington and Darwen; Preston and Bury have both
spinning and weaving plants. Engineering industries, notably the manufacture of
printing, textile and electrical machinery and commercial vehicles, are, however,
probably more important to the area today than cotton. The Lancashire coalfield
also lies in the Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas trade,
links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through important industrial towns
such as Warrington with its metal industries, Widnes with its chemicals, and Ellesmere
Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens,
to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool is the second port
of Britain and a great commercial centre and, after London, the greatest centre for
food processing, especially flour milling and sugar refining. Among its older industries
is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across the river at Birkenhead.
Many new industries, including electrical engineering and the manufacture of other
heavy industrial equipment have been established in the Liverpool area, particularly
on industrial estates (see p. 256). Barrow, in the north-west of the county, is a well-
known shipbuilding area.
Yorkshire
Most of the county’s industry is located in the West Riding, where about 90 per
cent of the United Kingdom’s worsted industry and the greater proportion of its
woollen industry are found. Bradford is the main city for worsteds and also the com¬
mercial centre of the whole wool trade; Morley and Leeds specialise in cheaper cloths,
and Batley, Dewsbury and Cleckheaton in heavy cloth. Huddersfield has a reputation
for fine woollens and Halifax for carpets. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area,
has a large ready-made clothing industry and manufactures a range of engineering
products. Further south is the heavy engineering centre of Sheffield, famous for its
high quality steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide about
one-fifth of Britain’s coal. York, noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture
and with important railway shops, and Hull, one of the world’s largest fishing
ports and with many manufacturing industries, including engineering, vegetable oil
processing, paints and sawmilling, are other important industrial towns in Yorkshire.
North-east England
The coal industry is of great importance in Northumberland and Durham. Tyneside
and Wearside together are second only to Clydeside for shipbuilding and ship repairing,
and ships are also built at the Hartlepools and on Tees-side. Iron and steel plants are
situated at Consett, in County Durham, and in the Middlesbrough area, which is also
the most important centre for chemicals in Britain. Tyneside is particularly noted for
the manufacture of heavy electrical equipment. Other industries of the area, whose
manufacturing structure has been greatly diversified since 1937, are mining and other
machinery, rolling mill plant, machine tools, ropes, glass and scientific instruments.
Wales
Although coalmining, including the extraction of special coals such as steam coal
and anthracite, remains the chief industry of South Wales, the area today produces
INDUSTRY
255
many categories of capital and consumer goods. Its steel industry, with some of the
most modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tinplate and a
large proportion of sheet steel. In the past 25 years a number of new industries have
been established, including plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics and light
engineering; many of the new factories are on industrial estates (see p. 256). The
largest cities are Cardiff and Swansea. In North Wales a number of light industries
are located in the seaside resorts and other towns, particularly Wrexham.
Scotland
The thickly populated, industrial area of Clydeside, wrhose capital is Glasgow, is
Britain’s largest shipbuilding and marine engineering centre. The steel industry,
specialising in plate and heavier products, is mainly in the Motherwell area. A variety
of engineering products, such as earth-moving equipment, locomotives, air-condition¬
ing plant, industrial valves, food-processing machinery and commercial vehicles, are
manufactured on Clydeside. The Scottish coalfields of the Lothians, Fife, Ayr, and
Lanark produce about one-tenth of Britain’s coal, but the seams in the last named
field are gradually becoming exhausted.
Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland and its second largest city, has printing, brewing
and engineering industries. The United Kingdom jute industry is concentrated in
Dundee, which also provides many other products, such as office machinery, clocks
and watches, refrigerators, and food manufactures. Aberdeen, the third city of Scotland
and a famous fishing port, has several light industries. Kirkcaldy, in Fife, is the centre
for the manufacture of linoleum. The border towns in the south are especially renowned
for high quality woollens. The north of Scotland possesses Britain s only significant
resources of hydro-electric power.
Northern Ireland
A shipyard which is the largest in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest in
the world, is located at Belfast, where there is also a large aircraft construction establish¬
ment. In addition to marine engineering, Northern Ireland has a range of other
engineering activities, and traditional industries of the area include linen, shirt-making,
ropes, and tobacco.
Distribution of Industry Policy
Government policy is particularly concerned with the distribution of industry.
While the Government has no power to direct an individual firm to set up a new
factory or plant in any particular area or site, it has sought, on both economic and
social grounds, to control the expansion of industry in some areas and to encourage
it in others.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts, the consent of the local planning
authority is, in general, necessary for any new building, any extension of a building or
any change in the use of an existing building. Where industrial floor space of 5,000
square feet or more is to be created, such consent cannot be sought without a certificate
from the Board of Trade that the development is consistent with the proper distribution
of industry. An important result of the use of these powers has been to slow down the
expansion of industry in congested areas, such as Greater London or Birmingham.
The main aim of the Government’s positive measures has been the alleviation of
local unemployment. The first Act dealing with this problem, the Special Areas
(Development and Improvement) Act, was passed in 1934, a time of acute economic
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
256
depression (see p. 242); its aim was to help certain large industrial regions, in which
over a third of the working population were unemployed. Under this Act and an
amending Act of 1937, these regions—West Cumberland, the north-east coast of
England, South Wales and the Clyde Valley—were designated ‘special areas’ and special
commissioners were made responsible for their development and improvement.
Industry was attracted to the areas by certain inducements, mainly the lease of factories
built by Government financed non-profit-making estate companies and also certain
loan facilities and Government grants.
Under the Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, the special areas were
renamed ‘development areas’ and enlarged, and the Government’s powers of assistance
were strengthened. The Board of Trade took over the special commissioners’ powers
to build and let factories in the areas and, in addition, could and did designate additional
areas, while the Treasury had powers to make loans or grants to undertakings unable to
secure finance through normal channels.
Since the passing of these Acts, the pattern of local unemployment has changed.
The general employment position has remained much better than pre-war, while
the special problems of some parts of the development areas have, by and large,
disappeared partly as a result of Government’s action. On the other hand, employment
problems have emerged in a number of new, and often quite small and isolated,
districts. To enable them to deal more flexibly with changes in the pattern of unemploy¬
ment, the Government acquired in July 1958 new powers under the Distribution of
Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, which enabled the Treasury, acting on the
advice of the Development Areas Treasury Advisory Committee (DATAC), to give
financial assistance to undertakings which would provide employment in places with
high and persistent unemployment, whether or not they were within development
areas. Between July 1958 and the end of March i960, the Treasury provided assistance,
to a total value of over £9 million, to 165 undertakings in Great Britain. This assistance
was expected to lead to the creation of 13,500 new jobs.
The legislative basis of the Government’s powers to alleviate local unemployment
has now been simplified and strengthened by the passing of the Local Employment
Act, i960, which came into effect on 1st April, i960. Under the Act, the Government’s
powers of assistance are centred in one department, the Board of Trade, which can
name as ‘development districts’ places where high and persistent unemployment
exists or is expected, and can offer a number of inducements to industrialists to settle
or expand in these districts. Specifically, the Board can build factories for leasing or
sale on favourable terms; make a capital grant towards the cost of an industrialist’s
own factory; and make loans or grants towards working capital or the cost of initial
equipment. The appropriate Government departments can also make grants to local
authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for improving basic services.
Under the Act, the Government-controlled industrial estate companies, which
under the Distribution of Industry Acts had run the industrial estates in the develop¬
ment areas, have been replaced by three industrial estate management corporations,
one for England, one for Wales and one for Scotland. These corporations are
controlled and financed by the Board of Trade.
The Local Employment Act does not apply to Northern Ireland because, under
the Northern Ireland constitution, the matters it deals with are the concern of the
Northern Ireland Parliament, which has passed its own legislation to encourage
industrial expansion and diversification. The Northern Ireland Government builds
factories for renting or purchasing on favourable terms and provides grants and
loans for new industrial undertakings, and the Board of Trade gives Northern Ireland
INDUSTRY
257
priority as if it were a development district for the purposes of encouraging and guiding
new or expanding industrial development. As a result, since 1945, 141 firms have
started production for the first time in Northern Ireland and 93 schemes of expansion
have been put into effect. These new firms and expansion schemes are already providing
employment for 38,000 people. The United Kingdom Government also gives manu¬
facturers in Northern Ireland, as in development districts in Great Britain, some
preference in placing Government contracts.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. In England and
Wales, there is the Rural Industries Bureau, which, on the recommendation of Rural
Community Councils, provides technical advice and instruction to craftsmen and
small rural businesses; it also provides loans from the Rural Industries Loan Fund,
started in 1940, for the acquisition of equipment and the purchase or improvement of
workshops. In Scotland, the corresponding body is the Scottish Counties Industries
Development Trust, founded in 1935, which exercises local and national responsibilities
for the development of rural industries.
Development Organisations
In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales there are national organisations devoted
to encouraging the expansion and diversification of industry. The Northern Ireland
Development Council, established in 1955, makes more widely known in Great
Britain, the United States and elsewhere, the facilities offered by Northern Ireland
to new undertakings; and advises the Northern Ireland Government on matters
connected with industrial development. The chairman of the council is appointed by
the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and the other members are appointed by the
Prime Minister in consultation with the chairman. In Scotland, the Scottish Council
(Development and Industry), with a wide membership including local authorities,
trade associations, trade unions, chambers of commerce, co-operative societies and
banks, is concerned with the economic development of Scotland. It assists the expan¬
sion of existing industry, fosters the growth of new industries, especially in areas
requiring development, encourages exports, organises exhibitions and publicises
Scottish trade and industry. In Wales, there are several voluntary associations con¬
cerned with the needs of Welsh industry as a whole, but the most similar in aims and
constitution to the Scottish Council is the Development Corporation for Wales,
founded in 1959.
In England, there are a number of industrial development associations concerned
with studying the industrial needs of certain regions or areas and with trying to attract
suitable industry to them. These associations are sponsored mainly by local authorities
and trade associations, but may also include firms, financial and commercial interests,
and individuals in their membership.
The Structure of Industry
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal, corporate,
co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different forms, and all
are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from the many small work¬
shops to vast organisations such as the National Coal Board, a public corporation with
over 700,000 employees; Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability com¬
pany which, with its subsidiaries, employs about 110,000 persons in the United
Kingdom; and the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a co-operative society with
some 50,000 employees.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
258
Role of Public Enterprise
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the growth of the social services,
especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively greater influence
of the public sector of the economy. There was also an increase in the State’s direct
participation in productive economic activities, particularly in the decade 1940-50.
Since 1951, however, most of the steel industry and the road haulage services of the
British Transport Commission have been returned from public to private ownership.
State participation is effected mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal
with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not part of a Government department,
are under a considerable but varying degree of public control (see pp. 263-4). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate major
industries and services in the public interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and its
staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are
not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring departments
who are responsible for the management of the corporations. Certain of the corporations
are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help them in carrying out the
duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were established1
in those industries and services where it was considered that the national interest
required co-ordination or control by a public authority. Their constitutions had no
standard pattern and their governing bodies differed in the method of appointment
and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services, including coalmining,
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply, and civil air transport.
These post-war corporations are less varied in the structure of their governing bodies,
which are appointed by the responsible minister, who has full powers of dismissal.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are described
in later chapters, are now operating or controlling large-scale industries or services:
The Bank of England.
The British Broadcasting Corporation.
Cable & Wireless Limited.
The British Transport Commission.
The Ulster Transport Authority.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation.
1 The principal corporations appointed before the second world war were: (1) the Central
Electricity Board, established by the Electricity Supply Act, 1926, to rationalise electricity
generation and build and operate a main transmission system; (2) the British Broadcasting
Corporation, established in 1927 by Royal Charter to provide a national broadcasting service;
(3) the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, established by the Electricity (Supply) Act
(Northern Ireland), 1931, to develop electricity supplies in Northern Ireland outside the two

Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining. The
coalmining industry of Great Britain (see pp. 305-309), is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board.
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (e.g., iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk, lime¬
stone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprise,
usually owned and operated by limited liability companies. About 75,000 workers are
employed in mining and quarrying, excluding coalmining.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Some exceptions are
locomotives and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, built in workshops owned
and operated by the British Transport Commission, a considerable quantity of arms
and military equipment made in Royal Ordnance factories and other factories operated
by the War Office and the Ministry of Aviation, and some fighting ships built in naval
dockyards operated by the Admiralty. The staff of the Stationery Office do some print¬
ing and bookbinding, while the repair, and to a limited extent the construction of
post office equipment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
to persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results of the most
recent of these surveys, based on returns rendered by employers in April 1959, show
that nearly a third of all employees in such establishments are in those employing
from 100 to 499 persons, while slightly over a third are in establishments employing
1,000 or more persons. A high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy
industries, while the average size of establishments in industries making consumer
goods is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results
obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow but significant
trend towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing establishments: in
1959, establishments with 1,000 or more employees were found to employ 2,610,000
persons, over ten per cent more than in 1953 and more than twice as many as in 1935.
In addition, there are some 150,000 manufacturing establishments with fewer than 11
employees and in these a total of about 1 • 1 million workers are employed.
There are no general surveys of the size of manufacturing firms comparable with the
survey of establishments. The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the
size of manufacturing firms, as a single firm may own several establishments, not all
of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities. Moreover, one firm
can control a number of subsidiary companies. There are in all some 350,000 registered
companies in the United Kingdom, of which about 16,000 are public companies;
26o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a large proportion of these companies are engaged in manufacturing. Evidence suggests
that nearly half of all manufacturing employees are in the ten per cent of all manu¬
facturing establishments operated by some 2,000 public companies quoted on the
stock exchanges. In some industries a small number of big companies and their sub¬
sidiaries are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil-refining,
steel making, the manufacture of motor vehicles and components, aircraft and aero
engines, heavy electrical equipment, bicycles, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in
these companies are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is
rare for a few large holders to have a controlling interest.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is
usual for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production
(spinning, weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile industry
all these processes are commonly undertaken within the same firm. Some of the leading
establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the assembly
of parts, many of which have been built for them under contract by specialist firms.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on pp. 327-358.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by private
contractors. Since the end of the second world war, most new houses have been
built by firms under contract to local authorities, but the majority are now built on
private orders, or for sale (see p. 179).
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work, many of which
operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry of
small firms; more than half of the firms employ fewer than twenty employees, b or a
fuller account of the building and civil engineering industries see pp. 324-27.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices.
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying com¬
pleteness, most of British industry but there are wide sectors of industry where
there is no collective agreement to regulate trading practices. Associations which
deal with labour matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of operation
or manufacturing process. Organisations mainly concerned with representations to
the Government, provision of common services or the regulation of prices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerned
wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all the
required functions.
There are about 270 national federations and probably about 1,600 other employers’
organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the national
federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of work. Most
INDUSTRY
26l
of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers' Confederation,
the national body representing employers on labour questions affecting industry
generally (see p. 469).
The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned with providing common
services and regulating prices and trading methods is not known precisely, but
according to a survey carried out by Political and Economic Planning between 1953
and 1956, some 1,300 were in existence, varying greatly in importance, structure
and activities. Membership of the Federation of British Industries (FBI), the national
body recognised as the spokesman for British industry on economic, commercial
and production (as distinct from labour) matters, consists of some 7,500 individual
firms and nearly 300 national trade organisations, with a total affiliated membership
of some 40,000 to 45,000 firms. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres
in the United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad. It has a wholly owned
subsidiary company, British Overseas Fairs Limited, which is responsible for organising
British trade fairs overseas.
A number of the organisations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organisations work
closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Union of
Manufacturers (NUM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The
members of NUM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 66 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central organi¬
sation to which 98 local chambers of commerce (together with 15 British Chambers
of Commerce operating in foreign countries) are affiliated. The Association celebrated
its centenary in i960. In Scotland, there is also a central organisation, the Council of
Scottish Chambers of Commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and
traders and exist for promoting the interests of local industry and commerce. The
FBI, the NUM and the Chambers of Commerce often act jointly in matters of
common concern.
Relations with Government
The Government is able to influence industry in a number of ways—through fiscal
and monetary policy, by means of physical controls and inducements, as well as by
providing information and advice.
A system has grown up whereby a particular Government department acts as the
main point of contact, or ‘ production department’, for each major industry.
The department through which the Government’s relations with trade and industry
are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade, and its responsibilities cover a wide range
of industries and materials. Certain industries and services, however, are the
responsibility of other departments, as production departments:
Ministry of Aviation .. .. .. Aircraft, aero engines, electronics
industries and civil aviation.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Farming, horticulture and agricul¬
tural machinery in England and
Wales; fisheries and food pro¬
cessing in Great Britain.
Ministry of Power .. .. .. .. Coal, oil, gas, electricity (including
nuclear power), iron and steel.

The Treasury is responsible for economic policy, and specifically for fiscal and
monetary policy through which it is able to influence the level of economic activity
and the utilisation of the nation’s resources. The Ministry of Labour is the channel
through which manpower policy is conducted.
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for matters
within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Ministry of Commerce
deals with industry, including the encouragement of industrial development.
During and after the second world war, many operations of industry and commerce
were subject to Government control. Very few controls now remain; of those in force
probably the most important is the power of the Board of Trade to influence the
location of industry. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government, acting through
local planning authorities, has powers to control the use of land (see pp. 185-6). The
export and import of a small range of products still require Board of Trade approval.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office, was established
in 1940 to provide a comprehensive statistical service to assist the authorities in
framing economic and financial policy.
Although departments themselves compile statistics relating to their particular
responsibilities, and may publish them in their own standard publications, the com¬
prehensive statistical publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office, which
collects the main departmental statistics and compiles its own series from depart¬
mental and other information. Its regular publications are: the Monthly Digest of
Statistics, Economic Trends (monthly), the Annual Abstract of Statistics, the Preliminary
Estimates of National Income and Expenditure (published annually before the Budget)
and the fuller National Income and Expenditure Blue Book issued later in the year.
The Digest of Scottish Statistics is published half-yearly by the Scottish Statistical
Office, a Digest of Northern Ireland Statistics at half-yearly or yearly intervals by the
Ministry of Finance of the Northern Ireland Government, and an annual Digest of
Welsh Statistics by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In recent years,
statistical information about the United Kingdom has been made fuller and more
quickly available in accordance with a plan announced by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in 1956. Estimates of national income and expenditure and the balance of
payments are now published quarterly as well as annually; up-to-date information on
the trends of profits and of personal income and expenditure is being obtained by
means of sample surveys; additional information on recent and possible future trends
INDUSTRY
263
in investment is obtained, both by sample surveys and returns from building and civil
engineering firms about new contracts; and quarterly estimates of the value of stocks in
manufacturing industry and in the wholesale trade have been introduced.
To ensure that industry is fully aware of Government policy and also that policy
is framed with a full knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of
consultative bodies were set up representing Government, employers’ associations
and trade unions. Among the most important of these are the National Production
Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory Council
(NJAC). The NPACI, which covers the wider problems of industrial production,
is under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and includes representa¬
tives of the Regional Boards for Industry (see below) and of certain Government
departments as well as of employers and workers. Northern Ireland sends two repre¬
sentatives to meetings of the NPACI as observers. The NJAC consists of representa¬
tives of private employers, the nationalised industries and trade unions, under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Labour, and is concerned with matters affecting the
relations between employers and workers.
An important body, which is purely advisory to the Government rather than a
channel of communication with industry, is the Economic Planning Board. It was
established in 1947 to advise on economic policy; its proceedings are confidential.
The chairman of the board is one of the two Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury,
and its membership includes representatives of the Treasury, the Board of Trade,
the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Labour, and nominees of the Trades
Union Congress, the Federation of British Industries and the British Employers’
Confederation.
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are, in addition, consultative bodies concerned with the special
problems of Scotland and Wales and of the English regions. The most important
of these are the nine Regional Boards for Industry and the corresponding Scottish and
Welsh Boards for Industry, whose main functions are to keep the Government informed
on industrial conditions in the English regions and in Wales and Scotland, and to
provide a link between central Government and local industry. The regional boards
have set up district advisory committees wherever they considered that the geographical
grouping of industry justified such a step.
Government and. the Nationalised Industries
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of the
boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies from industry
to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them. First, the minister
appoints the chairman and members of each board, and secondly, he has power to give
general directions as to how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-
to-day management. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice,
as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are reached
in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to issue a
formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual financial
arrangement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that receipts
at least balance outgoings over a period of years. The responsible minister is usually
empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say what shall be done with any surplus
should the boards make a profit. As regards finance of capital expenditure, the present
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
264
system is that such finance is provided, in the form of interest-earning loans, by the
minister from the Exchequer; bank advances being used only for normal requirements
of short-term capital after outstanding loans have been repaid.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to see
that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually done
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints
and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes
they think desirable. It is recognised that these arrangements are still to a great
extent experimental.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of Parliament.
Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by debates, including debates
on their annual reports and accounts, and by answers to parliamentary questions, which,
in principle, are admissible only if concerned with policy rather than details of
administration.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries is
informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised
Industries was established in March 1957. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries established by
statute, whose controlling boards are appointed by the appropriate Ministers of the
Crown and whose annual receipts are not wholly or mainly derived from money
provided by Parliament or advanced by the Exchequer. The first report of the select
committee, published in October 1957, dealt with the two Scottish electricity boards
and also discussed ministerial control of the nationalised industries. Later reports,
published in 1958 and 1959, respectively, related to the coalmining industry and the
airways corporations. A special report, in July 1959, called attention to the size and
complexity of the committee’s job, and asked that it should be provided with additional
help from persons with expert qualifications.
Production and Productivity
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and con¬
tracting, and gas, electricity and water) increased rapidly in the immediate post-war
years as industry was turned over from war production and manpower was released
from the armed forces. It had regained the pre-war level by 1946, was 14 per cent
greater by 1948, and by 1954 it had exceeded the 1948 level by a further 27 per cent.
The course of production, employment and output per man-year from 1 oca to iqcq is
shown in Table 13.

INDUSTRY
265
Partly because of measures taken to check inflationary trends, production from 1955
to 1958 showed only small changes. Industrial capacity did, however, increase fairly
steadily during this period. Thus, when in the latter part of 1958 it was judged safe
to withdraw most of the restrictions on home demand, imposed since 1955, production
and productivity increased sharply. The increase in i960 is likely to be on a reduced
scale compared with 1959, as the volume of unused capacity and resources available
is much smaller.
Between 1954 and 1959 increases in production of 30 per cent or over were recorded
in the electronics, electrical engineering and vehicles industries; of over 25 per cent
in chemicals; and of over 21 per cent in glass. Consumption of electric power over
the same period rose by nearly 45 per cent.
The promotion of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry
itself. Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise
industrial productivity. The former often provide technical assistance and conduct
market surveys. The National Union of Manufacturers (NUM) has established an
advisory service to enable small firms to obtain advice on production problems. The
trade unions in many industries organise special schemes for training young people,
and also a variety of courses designed to give trade unionists an understanding of
modern management techniques. Private consultants specialising in management
and work study are available to give advice to firms on measures to increase their
productive efficiency; there are also many specialist institutions, both public and
private, concerned with various aspects of productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) has been established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. The BPC was
set up in November 1952 to continue and develop the work of the Anglo-American
Productivity Council which, between 194^ <md sent productivity teams, made
up of representatives of management, technicians and operatives, from many British
industries to study progress and techniques in the United States. It is an independent
body on which are represented the British Employers Confederation, the Federation
of British Industries, the Trades Union Congress, the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce, the National Union of Manufacturers and the nationalised industries,
its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a Government grant-
in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity in the building
trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC s work is done through over
100 local productivity committees and associations throughout the country. These
local organisations arrange meetings, inter-factory visits, courses, conferences, film
shows and exhibitions. To assist them, and the many other national and industrial
bodies with which it co-operates, the BPC produces booklets, pamphlets, case studies,
films and a monthly bulletin, and arranges work study demonstrations.
The British Standards Institution (BSI), is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards in respect
of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods and codes of practice.
Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces
unnecessary variety and simplifies the specification of requirements, thus promoting
industrial efficiency. The BSI is governed by a council consisting of representatives
of the main organisations of employers and workers, professional institutions and the
larger Government departments.
The Board of Trade is the department responsible for general aspects of the
promotion of productivity and it administers the Government grants to the BPC,
the BSI, and the Council of Industrial Design.
266
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on productivity.
The Ministry of Labour has a Personnel Management Advisory Service, which advises
industrial concerns on questions of personnel management. The Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research, whose chief purpose is to promote the researches
which are the main basis of the long-term growth of efficiency, is also concerned directly
with research into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, production
engineering and operator fatigue which immediately affect productivity; it also provides
technical advisory services. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the technical
colleges, at which courses are available in such subjects as work study and industrial
engineering. The Ministry of Works provides a Technical Information Service for
the building industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity Council
sponsor the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food provides a number of advisory services which aim at encouraging
the efficiency of the British farming industry; these include the National Agricultural
Advisory Service, the Agricultural Land Service, and the Veterinary Service.
Management
A factor contributing to the growth of productivity in British industry has been
the development of new methods of management. During the present century, and
particularly during and since the second world war, there has emerged in the United
Kingdom, as elsewhere, a growing awareness of the importance of management
as a subject requiring special skills and knowledge. This has been stimulated by the
increasing pace of technical, organisational and social change, and by the need to
compete successfully in world markets in the face of rising production costs. In
addition, increased attention is being paid to human relations in industry, and to the
importance of communication between management and labour.
Many organisations are contributing to the growing knowledge and appreciation
of the wider functions of management. They include institutes and societies con¬
cerned with specialist subjects of interest to managers, such as industrial psychology
and industrial welfare; associations of those who work in particular fields of manage¬
ment, such as sales managers; and professional bodies whose members may be managers
or those who work closely with them, such as accountants or engineers. The professional
engineering institutions, for example, include industrial administration in the syllabus
of their qualifying examinations.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) was founded in 1947, with Government
support, to study and promote improved standards of management throughout industry,
commerce, and public administration. It is now entirely financed from industrial
and professional subscriptions. The main objects of the BIM, which combined in
I957 with the Institute of Industrial Administration, are to provide information on,
and undertake research into, management practices and techniques, and to encourage
the development of education and training for management on a national scale.
Facilities for management training at all levels have been much extended. Education
for management is developing mainly in four ways:
(1) a national scheme, for the syllabus of which the BIM and the Ministry
of Education are jointly responsible, operated through technical and com¬
mercial colleges. The scheme is being revised and under the new
arrangements, starting in the autumn of 1961, ordinary and higher national
certificates in business studies and, at a much higher level, diplomas in
management, will be awarded on the basis of examinations;
INDUSTRY
267
(2) independent courses organised by universities, other educational establish¬
ments, professional organisations, industrial consultants, and certain centres
specialising in management training (e.g., the Administrative Staff College at
Henley-on-Thames, and Ashridge College in Hertfordshire);
(3) training courses organised by employers’ associations and various voluntary
bodies; and
(4) formal courses and informal training within individual firms, some of which
have their own residential centres.
There are probably between 400,000 and 500,000 persons who hold managerial
posts in industry and commerce in the United Kingdom, and only a minority of
them are as yet members of any management body or have received systematic training
in the principles of management.
The growing number of firms and individuals working as management consultants—
more than 1,500 in 1959—and the use of the services of independent management
selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are indications of the changing attitude
towards the science of management in Britain.
Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Competition may be limited either by agreements (formal or informal) between
suppliers, or by monopolies which dominate the market; legislation in force in the
United Kingdom for dealing with these problems is described below.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, provides for the examination and
control of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry on a public register of the
particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements (including those relating to
common prices, approved lists of dealers and the limitation of production) which
affect the supply or processing of goods for the United Kingdom market. The
Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements is responsible for keeping the register
and for bringing the agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under
the Act. The court includes laymen but is presided over by a High Court Judge.
It is responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public interest.
If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the court that their restrictions confer
on the public one or more of the benefits set out in the Act, that these benefits out¬
weigh the disadvantages of the restrictions and that the degree of restriction is not
unreasonable, the agreement is declared void. The court can make orders preventing
the parties from operating their agreement, or from making new arrangements having
the same effect. The first full hearing before the court took place in October 1958,
and in the following eighteen months ten cases came before it.
Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure but have
to be notified to the Board of Trade.
Monopolies and other arrangements which are not within the scope of the Restric¬
tive Practices Court may be referred by the Board of Trade to the Monopolies Com¬
mission for investigation and report. Production departments take appropriate action
on the basis of these reports, subject to the approval of Parliament. The commission
was originally set up by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control)
Act, 1948, under the title of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission.
Prior to the passing of the 1956 Act it had investigated a number of industries, several
of which modified their practices in accordance with its recommendations. The 1956
Act excluded from the scope of the commission’s work agreements which had to be
registered under the new legislation. It is now mainly concerned with the investigation
of monopolies.
268
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
One form of restrictive practice, the collective enforcement of resale price main¬
tenance by the use of stoplists or boycotts, was prohibited by the 1956 Act. On the
other hand, the Act strengthened the powers of individual suppliers to enforce their
resale prices through the civil courts.
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on imports
for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most important
industries. It occupies nearly one million people, or over 4 per cent of those in civil
employment, provides about 4 per cent of the gross national product, and uses 48
million of the 60 million acres of land.
THE LAND AND ITS USES
Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable for
cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is hill or mountain
land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken, heather or scrub trees.
Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually assessed at about one-sixth of that
of agricultural land—but is valuable for sheep. In England and Wales, only about one-
sixth of the 29-5 million acres of farming land is classified as rough grazing, but in
Scotland the proportion is about three-quarters (12-5 million out of 16-8 million
acres). In the United Kingdom as a whole there are 30-9 million acres under crops and
grass. Improved land and rough grazing together represent 80 per cent of the land
area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area
available for farming is being gradually reduced to meet the needs of housing and
industry; however, the loss is outweighed by the increase in output from what
remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west and north,
overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river valleys are usually
fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt and peat. Clay soils everywhere
necessitate under-drainage, and as all are constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to
be applied at regular intervals. In hill country the area of improved land is often small,
but is usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill.
Size and Ownership of Farms
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size from a
few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to tenants. At all
times the tenanted holdings were interspersed with some owned by the farmers who
occupied them, and with some peasant or cottage holdings. Social changes of the past
half-century have completely changed the pattern of rural life in England and Scotland.
Estates duties have been a principal factor in the breaking up of estates, and what
remains of the original estates is usually managed by the owner himself. Most surviving
estates are still owned by private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, the
Church Commissioners, local authorities, the National Coal Board, and other corporate
bodies hold considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many have been bought by the
tenants already in occupation. Nearly half the farms in Great Britain today are
owner-occupied.
Although the average size of farms in Britain is about 68 acres of crops and grass,
many of the smaller holdings do not provide a full livelihood for the occupier. Esti¬
mates indicate that in England and Wales about 155,000 of the 356,000 agricultural
INDUSTRY
269
holdings provide only part-time work, but they only account for a little over 5 per
cent of the area under crops and grass. Of the 200,000 full-time holdings, about
two-fifths are over 100 acres and about 56,000 in the range of 50 to 100 acres. In
Scotland, the crops and grass area of the 24,000 farms worked part-time average
only 11 acres, but for the 31,000 full-time farms the average is 132 acres.
Scotland has two distinct farming zones: most of the good land lies in the east and
south of the country, while in the Highlands and Western Islands agriculture is quite
distinct from that of the rest of Britain, there being an exceptionally high proportion
of rough grazing to improved land. Numerous small occupiers are grouped in scattered
villages, each with a tiny area of enclosed land and rights of grazing on an adjoining
hill. The Highlands are thus divided between a few large and very large holdings and
a great many very small crofts.
In Northern Ireland there are only a few large estates. Almost all the land is divided
into holdings varying from a few acres to 300-400 acres. Most of these holdings are
occupied by the owner.
Types of Farming
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from farm to
farm. In many districts the mosaic of farms is dominated by one type and the bias
towards one product or group of products is so marked that the whole area takes on a
distinctive character. The map on p. 270 shows that in England the farms devoted
primarily to arable crops for sale are in the eastern part of the country, in East Anglia,
Kent, Lincolnshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato and vegetable growing
on a substantial scale marks the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridge¬
shire), the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands
in south Lancashire. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are so widely dispersed amongst
agricultural crops that it is not possible on a map of the scale employed to show their
distribution. In Scotland, the rich lowlands of the east coast, the Lothians and a
fringe of land around the Moray Firth are also primarily arable. Interspersed between
these arable areas and also in the south-east of England, there are large tracts where,
although much of the land is kept under the plough, the rearing and/or fattening
of cattle is an important enterprise.
In the south-west of Scotland dairying is extensively practised, but most of the
north-west is devoted to rearing sheep on rough hill land. The parts of England
bordering the Pennine hills and most of Wales have a similar pattern, though a good
deal of dairying, based on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming
is widely practised throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern Ireland, dairying
and mixed farming are practised throughout the country, but stock raising only in
isolated areas.
Tillage and Grassland
Traditionally, in England and Wales, old grass is regarded as the property of the
landlord; many leases still specify the fields which may not be ploughed, except under
penalty. But the tenant is free to sow other fields to grass if he wishes and to plough
them out whenever he wishes; so two types of grass came into existence old or
permanent grass, the property of the owner, and temporary grass or ley, a rotational
crop of the tenant, its lease of life depending on the system of farming.
In Scotland, which has never had the same tradition, the tenant is free to plough as he
chooses, although in practice very high-lying fields are ploughed with the main object
of renewal of the grass. The area under temporary grass has always been high.

The situation during the 1939-45 war called for a wholesale ploughing out of grass.
Since the end of the war, in all parts of the United Kingdom there has been a slow
return to permanent grass. On the arable land of England and Wales the old-style
rotations have been abandoned, and a cropping system has been adopted which allows
a high proportion of cereals, sugar beet and potatoes, with short leys. The western
counties of England show a heavy bias towards cereal crops with longer leys; in
Northern Ireland, while the greater proportion of the grassland is under permanent
grass, medium length leys are a common feature. Scotland, with its choice of crops
restricted by soil and climate, has returned to its pre-war pattern of rotational cropping,
in which leys occupy more than half the arable ground. Thus, in England and Wales,
nearly one-half of the 24 million acres of arable and grassland is under permanent
grass, about one-quarter under cereals and one-sixth under temporary grass. Of the
4.4 million acres in Scotland, only about a quarter is in permanent grass, against about
two-fifths in temporary grass; while in Northern Ireland over a half is permanent
grass and about one-quarter temporary grass.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION: CROPS AND LIVESTOCK
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and diseases,
and of the market; but during the present generation much has been done in Britain
to mitigate the risks. In part this has been effected through the advance of science, in
part through self-help by farmers’ organisations, but in greatest measure by Govern¬
ment action. The role of the Government, successively as financial supporter, as
war-time controller, and as guarantor and provider of technical and advisory services,
is described on pp. 280-291.
In the year 1930 the bottom of a long depression in British agriculture was reached.
Yet already the industry was becoming organised: separate National Farmers’ Unions
had been set up in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to give farmers
a collective voice; breed societies had been established to watch over the interests of
stock breeders; young farmers’ clubs were becoming numerous; a chain of research
stations had been constituted; and a comprehensive system of university, college and
farm institute education was in being.
By the outbreak of war in 1939, the long depression from which the industry had
suffered had resulted in a general decline in agricultural activity. Much land once in
arable cultivation had been allowed to revert to permanent grass. During the war
7 million acres of the permanent grass were ploughed, the area under potatoes was
doubled, and that under wheat and barley nearly doubled. The total number of cattle
increased slightly, chiefly owing to larger dairy herds; sheep and poultry stocks declined;
and the number of pigs fell by more than half.
Since the end of the war, and particularly since the easing of the balance of payments
position permitted freer importation of feedingstuffs, the general trend has been towards
the building up of beef and sheep stocks, and the number of pigs and poultry has
greatly increased.

Agricultural Production
The effect of these changes may be judged by reference to the total production of the
major agricultural commodities, shown in Table 16.
The general pattern since the end of the war shows a very large increase in all the
main crop products (except oats and potatoes), and in mutton and lamb, beef and milk.
Compared with pre-war, output of pigmeat and of eggs had increased in 1958-59 by
73 per cent and 87 per cent, respectively, this increase, and also that of milk, being

Food Supplies—Home Grown and Imported
Since 1939 the population of the United Kingdom has increased by some 4 million,
or approximately 8 per cent; yet the total proportion of the nation’s food supplied from
home sources has increased. Before the war Britain produced (in terms of value) abou
one-third of its food; it now produces about half. The percentages by weight of total

Crops
Wheat
The possibilities of wheat growing, wrhich is mainly confined to England, have been
changed out of all recognition by the advent of new strong strawed and heavy yielding
varieties, mainly from the continent of Europe, but some home-bred. These permit the
liberal use of fertilisers, and spring dressings of nitrogen have become accepted
practice. Crop yields of 2 tons per acre are no longer unusual.
The use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation of drying and storage
plant on a large scale, which may be operated on a co-operative basis or by a contractor.
Barley
There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to stock.
Malting barley has in the past commanded a much higher price than feeding grain,
but the disparity has now decreased. New varieties have greatly enlarged yields and the
area under this crop has increased.
Oats
There was a decline of 32 per cent in the total area under oats in the past decade,
and even in Scotland, where it is by far the most important cereal, the area fell by 23
per cent. No longer needed for horses, oats cannot compete in yield of grain with
modern barleys. Yet the crop thrives on acid and high-lying soils and endures damp
harvests; and no other can equal it in the fodder value of the straw.
Fodder Roots
In England, the turnip crop is giving way to kale and cabbage. In Scotland, the
decline has been less rapid and the acreage under turnips is now greater than in
INDUSTRY
275
England. The area under mangolds—grown almost entirely in England—has fallen
by 45 per cent in the past decade, while fodder beet, after a promising start, is now
grown on only a small scale. Rape retains a modest place as sheep fodder.
Sugar Beet
The sugar beet industry has been largely created by Government action. Beet is
grown mainly in the vicinity of the beet sugar factories, most of which are situated in
East Anglia and Lincolnshire. The crop is grown under contract to the British Sugar
Corporation, which supplies the seed, selects the fields, takes the entire output at fixed
prices and supplies growers with the resultant sugar beet pulp at a discount. The
average yield in 1959 was estimated at 13-4 tons per acre, but yields of 20 tons per
acre are sometimes achieved. Precision drilling has greatly reduced costs of growing,
and more than half the crop is mechanically harvested.
Potatoes
The English crop of early potatoes is grown in numerous, widely scattered districts
with favourable soils and climate. It supplies the market during the summer months
and reaches the consumer within a few days of lifting. Main crops, which are normally
stored before sale, are grown chiefly in the Fen counties, Essex, Lancashire and York¬
shire. In Scotland, early potatoes are grown in a small district in Ayrshire, but the
main industry is the supply of seed-raising potatoes for the English growers. In
Northern Ireland, both ware and seed potatoes are produced, and a large part of the
crop is exported to Great Britain and foreign countries.
Cultivation and raising of the crop is almost entirely mechanical, picking (and some
setting) being done by hand.
Dairy Farming
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when con¬
verted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain, milk is produced
primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk
is used for manufactured products. Production and liquid sales are now much greater
than before the war. Sales promotion by the industry is helping to maintain these
higher liquid sales. The average consumption per head is now about 4-6 pints per week.
Average yields per cow are still rising steadily; in England and Wales they have
increased during the last decade by nearly 25 per cent and now average 745 gallons a
year. Freedom from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and through the artificial
insemination (AI) centres, operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organi¬
sations, the influence of a small number of high-potential bulls is widely disseminated.
The Friesian breed now dominates both AI centres and farms on which bulls are
maintained in England and Wales; the Ayrshire breed is still most in demand in
Scotland. Milk production has also been stimulated by advances in grassland manage¬
ment, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of making high quality hay;
new methods of conversion into silage are being exploited. Most dairy farmers
practise some degree of intensive grass management, but hay of traditional type
remains the basic winter feedingstuff; it is invariably supplemented with purchased
concentrates.
Livestock
Beef Cattle
Although home production of beef is considerably greater than it was pre-war,
imports are lower and consumption per head has not yet overtaken the pre-war
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
276
level. Taste is changing and the public no longer wants joints from fully fattened
beasts. Normally, it does not pay to feed large amounts of concentrates to fatten cattle,
so they are maintained on grazing and the by-products of arable cash crops. In upland
regions herds of pure-bred, nearly pure-bred, or cross-bred beef stock are kept on
‘natural’ lines, the cows calving in early spring and grazing with their calves through the
summer. If there is sufficient lowland pasturage the calves may be retained on the same
farm for life; otherwise, they are sold at weaning to farmers with arable fodder and
good grazing. Nowadays much beef derives from the dairy herds, some females
(usually the first calf heifers) being mated to beef sires, and suitable breeds of bull
being maintained at AI centres. The cross-bred calves make useful beef animals;
so too do the pure-bred male calves from Friesian, Shorthorn and some other types of
herds. There is a large and complex trade in store cattle, increased by young
animals imported from the Irish Republic, whose general movement is from the
upland west to grazing areas in the Midlands and arable areas of the east.
Sheep
Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary researches
have provided vaccines and sera protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases
to which sheep are subject. More than thirty breeds and innumerable crosses are to be
found in Britain, each breed having originated within a circumscribed area. The basic
stocks are everywhere maintained by local selection, but lowland flocks are continually
reinforced by fresh blood from the hills.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually severe.
Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn to swell the lowland
flocks, usually in two stages; firstly, to farms at intermediate altitudes, where they are
mated with rams of a larger and more rapidly maturing breed; the cross-bred progeny,
in due course, pass on to the more genial conditions in the Midlands and in the south
and east of England, where they become crossed again with a variety of sires. The hill
breeds bring in hardiness and the first-cross sires fecundity and early maturity.
Wool, at one time of relatively little value, has recently acquired some importance
in the sheep farmers’ budget; research into breeding for fleeces is being undertaken,
notably among Welsh flocks. But the prime purpose of British sheep farming today is
the production of fat lambs, in response to the change in the preference of consumers
away from mature sheep. Leys are largely relied on for fodder, although in Scotland
the turnip crop is still of considerable importance.
Pigs
Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which the carcase
is put. Britain has always used the carcase in three different ways: for curing as bacon,
for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages or other processed forms. For
the several trades, pigs of three different weight ranges seem to be called for, roughly
in the order given; but one feature common to all is the desirability of leanness.
Breeders, in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for which there
is a grading system based on weight, carcase measurements of length and back-fat. The
native Large White breed yields carcases conforming closely to these requirements.
Some breeders in search of extra length have infused Landrace blood, imported from
Scandinavia. Others have turned to pure Landrace herds. For the trade in pork and
meat for processing, the Large White boar is generally used.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities, such as
size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of liveweight gain. Litter
recording and the progeny testing scheme operated by the Pig Industry Development
INDUSTRY
277
Authority are providing basic data. This authority, set up under the Agriculture Act,
1957, promotes improvements in the production of pigs and the processing and
distribution of pigmeat.
Poultry
Most farms keep some poultry, but about a quarter of the birds in the country are
kept on non-agricultural holdings, whether in backyards or on a commercial scale.
In the past twenty or thirty years specialist techniques have been used increasingly
and the industry has become more intensive. About five-sixths of laying birds on
farms in 1958 were still in flocks of one thousand or less, but the number of larger
flocks is increasing. With the rise in the poultry population and the yield of eggs per
bird, by 1957 nearly all eggs consumed in the country were home produced. The esti¬
mated total output in 1958-59 exceeded that of pre-war years by nearly 90 per cent.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and supply
of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. A scheme of accreditation
of breeders and breeding stock, known as the Poultry Stock Improvement Plan, is
operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and provides for technical
and veterinary supervision of breeding farms. The Scottish Poultry Improvement
Scheme and the Poultry Progeny Testing Scheme operated by the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland perform similar functions in Scotland. A
completely new branch of the industry has grown up in the mass production of so-called
broilers, i.e. chickens of eight to eleven weeks of age. It is estimated that some 100
million birds were sold in 1959, and the industry, which receives no subsidy, continues
to expand throughout the country.
Horticultural Crops
Horticultural crops occupy only a tiny fraction of the cultivated land of the country
—roughly 2^ per cent of the agricultural area—but their value in terms of output per
acre is very high. The total value of horticultural crops sold in 1959-60 is estimated
at about £140 million, compared with some ^260 million for farm crops. About
400,000 acres are under vegetables and about 295,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population, and in the
Thames valley, for example, some very large capital investments have been made. It
has also flourished in more rural areas with favourable soil or climatic conditions in
Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire and Kent, and in the Avon valley in a
concentration of smallholdings around Evesham. Early crop districts, such as the
Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of selected crops.
More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown in increasing quantities by
farmers as an alternative to potatoes: this applies particularly to brassicas and to peas
for canning, drying and quick-freezing.
The holdings range from a few acres up to about 300 acres, and many have glass¬
houses, frames or forcing houses. The larger ones normally have specialised packing
sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants. Dse of fertilisers,
particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the field work is mechanised.
Britain has some 4,000 acres of glasshouses, more than half of the area being used
primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which are the Lea Valley
in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on
a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth, some 1,000 acres are covered with glass. Total
production of tomatoes in the country is estimated at 100,000 tons, and the value of all
glasshouse crops at ^28 million.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
278
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk associated
with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the south, south-west and
east of England, and Kent in particular. Production of apples is about equally divided
between cooking and dessert varieties, with Cox’s orange pippin heading the latter
group. About 40,000 acres of varieties of cider apple are grown mainly in Devon,
Hereford and Somerset for the cider-making industry. Plums and soft fruits are grown
in many counties; concentrations of plums are found in Kent and Worcestershire, of
blackcurrants in Norfolk, of cherries in Kent and of strawberries in Norfolk and Kent.
Raspberries are exceptional in that of the 10,000 acres grown in Britain some 8,000
are found in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie district, in Perthshire.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two areas, in Kent and Sussex,
and in Hereford and Worcestershire. Capital outlay and cultivation costs are very
high, but returns average about 12 cwt., worth some £400, per acre. The total annual
value of the crop is about million.
FARM EXPENDITURE AND EARNINGS
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agricultural
producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments. A summary of the
estimates forecast for the year ended 31st May, i960, is given in Table 18.

INDUSTRY
279
The estimates show that Britain’s farming is based on livestock; fully two-thirds of
farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or their products. In
recent years the aggregate net income of farmers has usually been between £315
million and £36° million per annum. Government support to the industry has ranged
between approximately £200 million and £300 million.
Until i953-54> labour costs were the largest item in farm expenses, but since then,
feedingstuffs have accounted for the highest proportion. Although the number of farm
workers has dropped by about a quarter since 1949, the responsibilities of those
remaining have correspondingly increased and rising wages have caused labour
costs to increase by one-third in the same period.
Since 1945, rents have lagged behind other costs. This has been due partly to the
reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and partly to the
terms of reference given to arbitrators by legislation repealed in 1958 (see p. 289).
In recent years, however, many farms have been let by tender at highly competitive
rates—often £5 to £6 per acre.
Capital Requirements
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer, if he
is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant. Each year
‘fixed capital’ totalling some £25 million is added to the value of land and buildings.
The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is provided by the occupiers.
Bank advances are an increasingly important source of outside capital, both fixed and
working; about half the total bank advances to agriculture are believed to be for short¬
term purposes. Agricultural merchants are also an important source of short-term credit.
Accounts of some 2,300 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university agri¬
cultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging from £20
to £40 per acre. In Scotland, a similar sample of 900 accounts shows a wide range in
tenants’ capital per acre, from about £2 on hill sheep farms with extensive rough
grazings to between £30 and £50 per acre on lower ground farms. Dairy farms are
usually more heavily capitalised than other types of stock farms. On all types of farms
machinery is a heavy item; even on stock-rearing farms it may amount to £5 per acre;
on dairy farms it is often £10 per acre and on arable farms up to ^15 per acre.
Mechanisation
The best single measure of mechanisation is perhaps the rate at which horses
have been replaced by tractors. In Great Britain the number of farm horses fell from
about 642,000 in 1939 to 115,000 in 1959; tractor numbers rose from 102,000 in 1942 to
425,000 in 1959. Britain now has one of the greatest tractor densities in the world:
one to every 34 acres of arable land. Power-take-off implements now characterise
arable farming; and some 48,000 combine harvesters were in use in the 1959 harvest.
A wide variety of machines for harvesting and preservation of grass are employed.
Milking machines are installed on all except the smallest farms, many with mechanical
means of handling milk. Three-quarters of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity
supply and accompanying equipment.
Net Income
The range of profits between individual farms is very wide, varying with the size of
farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier. Farms do not lend them¬
selves readily to exact classification by type, so even averages must be treated with
caution. Nearly all group averages of recent years, however, show profits of £5 to
K
28o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£10 per acre: there is a marked tendency for small farms to show higher profits
per acre than large ones, owing principally to the higher proportion of profit represented
by personal work on the small farm.
Profits on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions, been maintained
at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has shown consistent but moderate
profits, while those on stock-raising farms have usually been low, except where arable
sale crops are also grown or pedigree stock is bred. The profitability of pedigree stock
breeding can be assumed from the rise in prices for breeding animals throughout the
period. Exports of livestock (other than horses) were valued at over million in 1959 _
THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
During the last hundred years the Government has played an ever-increasing
part in British agriculture. Since the opening up of the great primary-producing
countries of the New World and the Antipodes in the latter part of the nineteenth
century, producers of food had been at a disadvantage because supplies tended to
exceed effective demand. One answer to the problems posed for British farmers by this
situation would have been to discourage imports of primary products, but Britain,
being a great trading nation, was always reluctant to impose import duties in defence
of its agriculture—by then a relatively small part of the nation’s economy; such a
course would have cut back trade, handicapped exports of manufactured goods and
raised the price of food. By the beginning of the 1930s, however, the need for some
form of State assistance to agriculture had become pressing; during the following
decade and subsequently, the main object of the Government’s agricultural policy
was to find methods of supporting domestic agriculture without prejudice to Britain’s
position as a world trading nation.
During the 1930s, the Government initiated various forms of protection and financial
assistance for agriculture. Commodity commissions were set up for wheat and live¬
stock, with responsibility for administering Government subsidies or other forms of
direct financial assistance for the production of those commodities: the British Sugar
Corporation took over the sugar-beet factories, and producer-controlled marketing
boards were established with powers to regulate the marketing of milk, pigs and bacon,
hops and potatoes. In 1934, subsidy payments were introduced to encourage the
production of beef cattle, and, in 1937, the Government assumed powers to pay
acreage subsidies to assist producers of barley and oats.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agricultural
production was closely controlled by the State, with County War Agricultural Executive
Committees, composed of local representatives of agricultural interests, acting as the
Government’s local agents. As a result of Government control, purchase and rationing,
the functions of marketing boards and commodity commissions were largely suspended.
To ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers and farm workers, whilst at the
same time keeping the cost of living steady, most of the basic farm products were
purchased at fixed prices on Government account and sold at controlled prices, often
below the cost of procurement; the difference in price was borne by public funds.
This practice continued as long as rationing lasted.
Post-war Policy
Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act of 1947. The main !
objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be ‘a stable and efficient
agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food and other
INDUSTRY
281
agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United
Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration
and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return
on capital invested in the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered
to provide, for the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the
light of annual reviews.
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about 1954.
During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return to something
like the traditional pattern of British farming. During this period, as during the war,
‘production objectives’ were set for each of the main commodities, though the Govern¬
ment gradually ceased to direct farmers what to grow. By means of additions to the
prices fixed at annual reviews (see p. 282), ^40 million per annum were injected into
farm incomes to provide additional working capital for expansion. The Hill Farming
Act of 1946 offered grants for the rehabilitation of hill farms, and by encouraging
investment in fixed equipment, set the pattern for later legislation.
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own agricultural production and trading
position improved, the Government gradually restored to private business both the
importing of food and domestic trading in food. The last remnants of consumer
rationing of food were abolished on 3rd July, 1954. Since the ending of the period of
scarcity, policy objectives have changed. During the second period, stress has been
laid on more economic production of food of the kinds and qualities demanded by the
market, rather than on indiscriminate expansion of production. By 1957 the immediate
objective of a 60 per cent increase in production had been achieved, and attention was
turned to long-term measures. The Agriculture Act of that year assured farmers
that the prices guaranteed under the Act of 1947 would not be steeply reduced, and
at the same time provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to
date. In 1959 the problem of the small farm business was tackled (see p. 284). In the
following year, grants were made available for buildings and equipment for horti¬
culture, primarily with the object of improving the presentation and marketing of
horticultural produce.
Machinery of Government
The functions of Government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised by the
agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern
Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister responsible for United Kingdom
aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture, local aspects being the responsibility of the
Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a
number of advisory committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is divided
functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject or service. Its
relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through its local offices,
grouped in eight regions each administered by a regional controller working in close
collaboration with the regional heads of the technical services. County Agricultural
Executive Committees—successors of the War Agricultural Executive Committees—
have a number of duties, including that of promoting technical development and
advising the minister on local aspects of policy.
In Scotland, most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are discharged
through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, which has its headquarters
in Edinburgh, with the help and advice of 11 Agricultural Executive Committees.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
282
The Secretary of State also appoints the members of two commissions: the Crofters
Commission, which has powers to deal with the unique and difficult circumstances of
crofting in the Highlands and Islands (see p. 228), and the Red Deer Commission,
which has the general functions of furthering the conservation and control of red
deer and of keeping under review all matters relating to them.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture in Belfast has in each county an
agricultural executive officer who is responsible for carrying out the Government’s
agricultural policy.
CURRENT SUPPORT POLICY
Annual Review
In February each year, in accordance with the Act of 1947, the agricultural ministers
review the economic condition and prospects of the industry. Between annual reviews,
a special review may be held if the ministers consider it warranted, but this has seldom
been necessary. In holding reviews, the ministers are required to consult with repre¬
sentatives of agricultural producers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the
United Kingdom. In the course of reviews, the ministers consider such factors as
production trends and market requirements, world market prospects, the cost of
subsidies, the trend of profits in the industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of
the industry and changes in production costs, trading relations (especially with the
Commonwealth) and the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions,
they determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool, milk,
cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock and livestock
products for the ensuing twelve months, and to crops to be harvested in the current
year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of production or farming practice
(known as ‘production grants’) are also considered. Any changes in relevant production
grants (broadly, those payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into
account in the determination. The Government’s conclusions and its decisions on
changes in guaranteed prices and relevant production grants are published as a
White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require the total value of the
guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be maintained at not
less than 97I per cent of their value in the preceding year, after allowing for changes
in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted for any change in the basis of the
guarantee) for each commodity must be not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous
year. For livestock and livestock products—where farmers’ decisions need time to
take effect—there is a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for
any product must not total more than 9 per cent in any period of three years.
The general policy of the Government is to avoid direct intervention in the market
and therefore to use methods of agricultural support that allow the ordinary channels
of trade to flow freely. The form of guarantee most generally used is the deficiency
payment, which means that the Government makes payments to producers, related
to the differences between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price,
for output eligible for the guarantee. In order to persuade producers to lower their
costs of production and to increase their efficiency, pressure has been exerted at recent
reviews by gradual reductions in the guaranteed prices of commodities with which the
market is sufficiently supplied.
Price Guarantees
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered directly
by the agricultural departments. Payments for wheat and rye are based on the quantity
INDUSTRY
283
of millable grain sold and delivered by the grower. For barley and oats, crops which are
largely consumed on farms, payments are based on the acreage grown. Deficiency
payments for fatstock are made weekly to individual producers on certified sales on a
liveweight or deadweight basis. The weekly standard prices for fat cattle and fat sheep
vary on a seasonal scale; for pigs there is no seasonal scale but the weekly prices are
adjusted for changes in feed costs.
For most of the remaining commodities the Government makes a payment to the
appropriate marketing board, which takes account of any subsidy payments from the
Government in deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the case of milk
there are five such boards, and the full garanteed price applies only to a ‘standard
quantity’ which includes all milk sold for liquid consumption, together with part of
that going for manufacture. For milk in excess of its standard quantity a board receives
only a lower guaranteed price, but there is a profit and loss sharing arrangement between
the Government and each board, to encourage the boards to get the best prices they
can for milk for manufacturing. For eggs, a flat rate subsidy (also subject to a profit
and loss sharing arrangement) is paid to the British Egg Marketing Board on all eggs
sold to the board through packing stations. So far as potatoes are concerned, the Potato
Marketing Board receives from the Exchequer any deficiency that arises when the
average market price obtained by growers for potatoes for human consumption falls below
the guaranteed price. The board uses such funds as it thinks fit in the interests of growers.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board for every
pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in advance a schedule
of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after making allowance for its
marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act, 1956, and the Agriculture Act, 1957, the British Sugar
Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced from a specified
acreage (at present 414,600 acres) at a scale of fixed prices, determined as a result of the
annual review and related to sugar content. Refined sugar produced by the corporation
is sold, under market-sharing agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the
world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which result from the
transactions of both the corporation and the board are ultimately reflected in the
board’s accounts. When these accounts show a deficit, a levy is charged on all sugar
and molasses, imported or home-produced, entering the United Kingdom market,
including the sugar content of composite sugar imports, and when there is a surplus,
a distribution payment is made correspondingly, so that taking one year with another
the board balances its account.
Production Grants
The following are the main grants and subsidies which are relevant production
grants’ for the purposes of the Agriculture Act, i957> an<^ annua^ review.
Fertilisers and Lime
Schemes under the Agriculture (Fertilisers) Act, 1952, provide grants to assist farmers
in the purchase of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers. Farmers can also obtain a
refund of more than half their costs of liming the land to improve soil fertility.
Ploughing up Grass
Ploughing grants are available for land that has been continuously under grass for
not less than three years, to encourage the regular ploughing up and extended use of leys.
284
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Silo Grants
Grants amounting to about half the cost of approved projects, up to a maximum
of £250 a farm, are available under the Agriculture (Silo Subsidies) Act, 1956, for
constructing and improving silos for conserving grass and fodder.
Calf Subsidy
To stimulate the breeding and rearing of calves suitable for beef production, a
subsidy is paid to the rearer of suitable calves at the rate of £9 5s. a head for steers and
£7 1 os. a head for heifers.
Hill Cattle Subsidy
To encourage the production of breeding-cattle on hill farms, a subsidy of £12
per head is paid on breeding cows in regular breeding herds maintained on hill and
upland farms.
Small Farmers
To establish on a firm economic basis small farm businesses whose main handicap
is lack of working capital, grants are offered to small farmers who carry out three-,
four- or five-year improvement plans approved by the agricultural departments. The
limit is £1,000 for any one business. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland an
additional scheme, to help the small farmer for whom an improvement plan is not yet
practicable, supplements the existing lime and fertiliser subsidies, ploughing and
ditching grants. The Marginal Agricultural Production Scheme performs a similar
function in Scotland.
Destruction of Rabbits and Wood Pigeons
The principal mammals and birds in Great Britain harmful to farming are rabbits,
wood-pigeons, rats, mice and, in the north, carrion crows. Occupiers are responsible for
dealing with pests on their land and for seeing that they do not spread to neighbouring
properties. To encourage co-ordinated action, the Government pays a grant of half
the expenditure incurred by pest clearance societies in the systematic destruction
of rabbits and wood pigeons; over 500 rabbit clearance societies have been registered
in the United Kingdom. A similar grant is paid for the control of coypu, which have
been spreading in East Anglia. Contributions are paid to ‘fox destruction societies’ to
encourage organised control of foxes in open country where there is no hunting.
Grants for Long-term Improvements
In addition there are several types of grants for long-term improvements which
are not ‘relevant production grants’. Among them are the following:
Farm Improvement Scheme
Under the Agriculture Act, 1957, grants are available to the owners and occupiers of
agricultural land towards the cost of improving certain kinds of fixed equipment,
including farm buildings, roads and fences, and the supply of electricity. The rate of
grant is one-third of the cost. Grants are also available towards the incidental costs of
amalgamating uneconomic holdings.
Hill Farming
Under the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts, 1946-59, grants are available
to the owners and occupiers of upland farms suitable only for rearing livestock as
their main enterprise. (The Acts also apply to some lowland areas in the north of

Scotland where conditions are similar.) Grants amount to 50 per cent of the cost of
comprehensive schemes for putting the farms in sound working order.
Horticultural Improvement Scheme
Under the Horticulture Act, i960, grants are available to horticulturists, to the
landlords of land used for horticulture and, in some cases, to horticultural marketing
'co-operatives. The range of improvements towards the cost of which grants of one-
third may be made includes plant and equipment designed to improve the storage
or preparation of produce for the market.
Farm Drainage and Water Supply Schemes
The State contributes towards the cost of land drainage and water supply. In
England and Wales, for example, grants for farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent
of the approved cost. Farm water supply grants are at the rate of 25 per cent of the
approved cost where the connection is to a public main, and 40 per cent where a
private source is utilised. Grants of up to 50 per cent are available in Scotland for
farm drainage and towards the cost of installing and improving farm water supplies.
Separate legislation provides grants for these services in Northern Ireland.
Horticulture
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and is liable to great variations in
quantity and quality from season to season, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed
prices. Instead, horticulture enjoys through import duties a measure of protection
comparable to that afforded to agriculture by the guarantee system. Where appropriate
the tariff on horticultural produce is varied through the year so as to allow imports to
enter freely at times when they do not compete with the home crop. Certain of the
production grants are available to growers on the same terms as to farmers.
In November 1959, the Government issued a ‘policy for the improvement of produc¬
tion and marketing of horticultural produce’ (Cmnd. 880), referring to the need to
improve the presentation and marketing of agricultural produce and announcing the
Horticulture Improvement Scheme and the proposal to establish a Horticultural
Marketing Council representing all those concerned in the marketing of horticultural
produce—producers, wholesalers and importers, retailers and organised labour. Under
the Horticulture Act, i960, this council was set up in May i960 with the task of
improving the marketing and distribution of, and developing the trade in, horticultural
produce. Its functions include giving information about supply, demand and prices;
encouraging better grading and standardisation; carrying out research into marketing
and distribution methods; and publicity and advertising. It is the intention that
the council’s activities should eventually be financed by the horticultural industry;
the Horticulture Act, however, authorises the financing of the council from public
funds during its first three years of operation.
OTHER GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND ACTION
Land Use
It is an integral part of the Government’s planning policy (which is administered
in England and Wales by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, and in
Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland) that good agricultural land should
not be taken if there is less valuable land that would serve the purpose. The Ministry
of Agriculture assists in carrying out this policy in England and Wales by providing
expert advice to local planning authorities and other departments on the implications,
from the standpoint of the public agricultural interest, of all substantial proposals to
INDUSTRY
287
take agricultural land for other purposes. Appropriate arrangements exist for the
ministry to be consulted about such proposals. In Scotland similar arrangements
exist for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to give advice.
Agricultural Credit
The Government has never pursued a general policy of making credit available to
agriculture on easy terms. Nevertheless, a number of facilities for specific purposes
enjoy government encouragement and support.
In England and Wales, finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd.; this may take
the form of a loan on first mortgage or of an improvement loan. The corporation’s
funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, but it receives a measure of
government support. In Scotland, loans for agricultural purposes secured on
agricultural land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities
Corporation Ltd.; this corporation also receives support from the Government.
Improvement loans are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately. An improvement loan may be obtained
for the purpose of carrying out improvements to agricultural land and buildings. The
amount of the loan is charged on the land improved in the form of a terminable rent
charge. This type of loan requires the sanction of the ministers.
In Northern Ireland, loans are available to farmers for a wide range of purposes from
the Agricultural Loans Fund administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed
out of the public funds. The bulk of the loans issued are short-term and are for such
items as agricultural machinery, but in the case of buildings the period may be
extended to thirty years. No loans are advanced for purchase of land.
Smallholdings
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and Wales
have had powers to provide smallholdings. Later legislation imposed on them an obliga¬
tion to provide smallholdings and enabled the minister to contribute towards their
losses. The aim of this legislation was at first to foster a peasant economy, but later
to provide holdings for ex-Servicemen of the 1914-18 war, and then for the unemployed.
Now, under the Agriculture Act, 1947, the object is to give opportunities for persons
with agricultural experience, particularly agricultural workers, to become farmers
on their own account. In England and Wales, about 17,000 smallholdings are provided
by local authorities and about 1,3°° by the ministry.
Of the smallholdings provided by the ministry, approximately 1,000, situated
on 18 different estates, are managed by the Land Settlement Association Limited,
which was originally formed in 1934 to develop smallholdings for unemployed men
from industrial areas. The association provides centrally on each estate various services
for the tenants’ use, including the supply of agricultural stores and requisites, the
operation of a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing of produce.
The minister has power under the 1947 Act to make loans for working capital to
tenants of smallholdings. In this way tenants can be helped to obtain livestock,
machinery, implements and other necessary items; the tenant must, however, have
available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Government
which now owns and maintains some 432,000 acres of land settlement estates, wit
over 4,000 holdings.
288
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some economists question the value of this smallholdings policy on the ground that
many of the holdings are too small to provide a reasonable livelihood and that the
average size of holding in Britain needs to be increased rather than diminished. On
the other hand, it is difficult for persons without considerable capital or financial
backing to enter farming, and the smallholdings policy does provide an opportunity
for the experienced farm worker.
Crofting
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much of the land
is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are either rented at a cost of not
more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding 50 acres.
In these counties there are about 20,000 crofts, which produce about one-quarter
of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems of the crofting counties,
which had for some time been suffering from a declining population and falling agricul¬
tural production, led to the setting up, under the Crofters (Scotland) Act, 1955, of a
Crofters Commission whose functions are to reorganise, develop and regulate crofting
in the crofting counties, to promote the interests of crofters and to keep under review
matters relating to crofting. The commission has power to carry out reorganisation
schemes in derelict or decaying ‘townships’ (crofting communities) if a majority of the
resident crofters agree, by reallocating the land in a way which, in the commission’s
opinion, would lead to the proper and efficient use of the land and the general benefit
of the township. The commission has powers over the letting of crofts and it is
responsible for approving regulations governing the use of common grazings. It acts
as agent for the Secretary of State for Scotland in the administration of schemes of
loans and grants for the development of agricultural production on crofts, and colla¬
borates with other bodies in carrying out measures for economic development and
social improvement in crofting areas.
After four years of office the Commission reported in i960 on the ineffectiveness
of certain of its powers and recommended new powers for the long-term rationalisation
of the outdated pattern of minute units. This consolidation of holdings into full¬
time units raises social problems of maintaining viable communities which can only
be solved by a diversification of employment.
Arterial Drainage and Sea Defence
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered by 34 river boards1 and 400
internal drainage boards. Each river board area comprises a major river system. They
cover the whole of England and Wales, apart from the London area. (There are no
comparable boards in Scotland, where drainage is the responsibility of owners and
occupiers of land.) River boards have powers to maintain and improve watercourses
scheduled as main rivers. Their work is concerned with the improvement of land
drainage by increasing the capacity of rivers and erecting pumping stations, the
prevention of inland flooding—both urban and agricultural—and the erection of
defences to protect low-lying areas from coastal flooding. River boards also have powers
relating to freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
1 River boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural and fisheries
interests. The Thames Conservancy Board and Lee Conservancy Catchment Board are similar
in constitution and powers to the river boards; because London draws most of its water supplies
from these two rivers, however, they have long been regulated under the powers granted by Acts
of Parliament of purely local application.
INDUSTRY
289
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and their
work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural areas. Their main function is to keep the land
drained in their area by improving the main drains and, where necessary, by pumping
from low-lying land.
The boards derive their income directly or indirectly from rate-payers. The Govern¬
ment pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes carried out by both
types of board. Grants to river boards vary from 20 per cent to 80 per cent according
to the financial position of the board. Internal drainage boards receive grants at a
flat rate of 50 per cent.
The gross capital expenditure of drainage authorities on new and improved works
is now over million a year. Government grants, including grants towards the
repayment of loans raised in previous years, amount to about £3^ million. Drainage
authorities expenditure on maintenance is estimated at about £2\ million a year and
is rising steadily.
In December 1959, the Government issued a White Paper entitled Land Drainage
in England and Wales (Cmnd. 916), setting out proposals which would be embodied
in new legislation extending the powers of river boards to deal with arterial water¬
courses. At the same time, it is proposed to improve the administrative provisions of
the Land Drainage Act, 1930, and to extend the land drainage powers of local
authorities.
Land Tenure
By long tradition the typical agricultural tenancy in England and Wales is from year
to year, in Scotland from 10 to 14 years, and it is not always committed to writing.
Since uncertainty is inimical to good farming, the State defines the rights and
obligations of landlords and tenants.
The Agriculture Acts of 1947 and, for Scotland, 1948, lay down rules of estate
management and good husbandry defining the responsibilities of landlords and
tenants respectively. The landlord is responsible for providing fixed equipment;
the tenant must maintain a reasonable standard of production and preserve the fertility
of the land. Provisions in these Acts for contracts of tenancy (in Scotland, leases)
to be committed to writing if either party so requests were later incorporated in the
Agricultural Holdings Acts of 1948 and 1949 respectively.
In England and Wales, the responsibility for keeping fixed equipment in repair,
where not made explicit by a written agreement, is defined by regulations. Provisions
in tenancies which restrict unduly the farming operations of the tenant are
discouraged.
A satisfactory tenant farmer is assured of security of tenure. In the first place at
least twelve months’ notice to quit is needed; even so, the notice is inoperable if the
tenant objects, but, in that event, the landlord may apply in England and Wales to the
Agricultural Land Tribunal (an independent judicial body appointed by the Lord
Chancellor and composed of a lawyer chairman and two members representing farmers
and landowners respectively) or in Scotland to the Scottish Land Court, who may
consent to the notice if they are satisfied that it is in the interests of good husbandry
or for certain other reasons. If the tenancy is terminated, the landlord must compensate
the tenant for certain improvements and may claim for dilapidations.
Rents may be altered by agreement at any time or adjusted by arbitration at intervals
of not less than three years in England and Wales and five years in Scotland. The
criteria to be adopted by the arbitrator are laid down by the Agriculture Act of 1958-
A landlord is entitled to claim additional rent for improvements he has carried out.

Labour Legislation
Wages
In England and Wales and Scotland, Agricultural Wages Boards (see p. 472)
representing workers and employers with independent members appointed by ministers,
prescribe statutory minimum wage rates for all agricultural workers. Inspectors
appointed by ministers are responsible for securing the observance of the Wages
Acts and Orders made by the boards.
Safety, Health and Welfare
Legislation, comparable with the Factories Acts, now exists in Great Britain and
Northern Ireland to provide for the safety, health and welfare of farm workers and a
regulatory code is being built up which covers, inter alia, precautions to be taken when
dangerous chemicals are being used, first-aid equipment, the protection of children
and the guarding of farm equipment and machinery. Regulations are enforced by the
Safety and Wages Inspectorate. A voluntary scheme to protect consumers, domestic
livestock and wild life from adverse effects of poisonous chemicals is being operated
with success. All these measures are part of a wider campaign for safety in agriculture.
MARKETING
Most agricultural products are now disposed of through the normal channels of
trade, e.g., corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;
or through producers’ own co-operative marketing organisations, such as egg packing
stations. For certain commodities, however, there are marketing boards operating
under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers to regulate the market¬
ing of particular products. The schemes under which they are constituted and operate
must be approved by Parliament and confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the
members of the board are elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the
minister or ministers concerned. Other safeguards are provided for the protection of
consumers and the public interest.
Marketing boards fall into two categories: first, the full trading board with power
to become the first selling agency for virtually all producers; and second, regulatory
boards which exercise control over marketing by producers themselves. The boards
for eggs, hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and those for potatoes and for
tomatoes and cucumbers in the second.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Animals
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the veterinary
profession. The State veterinary service, which was inaugurated in 1865, deals with
situations beyond the control of the individual practitioner. The service for the whole
of Great Britain is now controlled from London, where the ministry’s Animal Health
Division is manned day and night to deal promptly with outbreaks of infectious disease.
Britain has now been freed for many years from eight serious animal diseases includ¬
ing rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies. A ninth has been almost eliminated;
for all practical purposes bovine tuberculosis has already been banished from Scotland,
Wales and the greater part of England; the eradication programme is expected to be
completed by 1961. Northern Ireland expects to do likewise.
INDUSTRY
29I
To supplement the work of private veterinary practitioners in England and Wales,
a Government-operated Veterinary Investigation Service carries out investigations
requiring specialised knowledge or facilities beyond the range of the general practitioner.
In Scotland, this is not a Government service but is linked with agricultural teaching
institutions.
The work of the State veterinary service is backed by applied research carried on
at the State veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and Lasswade, Midlothian.
Plants
Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given by the
advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is responsible for statutory
controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests and diseases present in Britain and
prevent the introduction of new ones from abroad. It also issues the health certificates
required by other countries to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development of
healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops subject to
degenerative diseases.
AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY SERVICES
The National Agricultural Advisory Service
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural
matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry of Agriculture’s
National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS). Every county has a county advisory
officer in charge of advisory work and is divided into districts, in each of which there
is a district advisory officer who can call on an extensive system of specialist advisers.
In Scotland, the advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on the
three agricultural colleges (see p. 293). Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory
service.
Facilities are provided at the NAAS experimental farms and horticultural stations in
England and Wales and at agricultural college centres in Scotland for field-scale
extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
The Agricultural Land Service
The main functions of the Agricultural Land Service, which operates in England and
Wales, are:
(1) to advise owners of agricultural land on estate management matters, including
farm buildings;
(2) to provide professional advice and services to the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and his agents on all matters relating to farm land;
(3) to provide expert professional advice to the minister and department on the
agricultural land use implications of planning proposals, including the
possibilities of reclaiming to agriculture, land worked for minerals by opencast
methods; and
(4) liaison with other departments and planning authorities about such proposals.
In Scotland, similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department
of Agriculture but advisory work regarding farm buildings is undertaken by the
agricultural colleges.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
292
The work of the advisory and veterinary services is supplemented by numerous
technical publications.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Research
Agricultural research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council (see p. 210) and is largely financed by the State. The council has
23 research stations and units under its direct control and is responsible for the
administration of Government grants to 14 independent research institutes in England
and Wales; in Scotland, eight independent research organisations receive grants
through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland also have their own research laboratories (see p. 215). Grants are also
made by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to universities and to other recognised
research institutions.
The Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, founded in
1843, was the first such institute in the world and is still a leading authority for research
on soils, fertilisers and crop husbandry. Others of outstanding importance include the
Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, Aberdeen; the Rowett Research Institute,
Aberdeen, which specialises in the study of animal nutrition; the Research Institute
at Pirbright, Surrey, for animal virus diseases; the East Mailing Research Station, in
Kent, and the Long Ashton Research Station, Bristol University, for fruit research;
the John Innes Horticultural Institution, Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire; the National
Institute for Research in Dairying, Reading, Berkshire; the Grassland Research
Institute, Hurley, Berkshire; and the Welsh Plant Breeding Station at Aberystwyth.
Research on stored products pests is done at the Pest Infestation Laboratory,
Slough, and the subsequent development and control work at the ministry’s laboratory
at Tolworth, where research on the control of harmful mammals and birds is
also centred.
Information on research is exchanged with other Commonwealth countries through
the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux and Institutes (ten Bureaux
and two Institutes in the United Kingdom and one Institute in Canada).
In England and Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the
Provincial Agricultural Economics Service, which comprises ten university Depart¬
ments of Agricultural Economics and which is not co-ordinated by the ARC. In
Scotland, agricultural economists are on the staff of the three agricultural colleges.
The agricultural departments in both England and Wales and Scotland have economics
and statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, which also has its Farm Economics
Branch, has, in addition, its own research divisions investigating problems of animal
and crop production.
Industrial concerns manufacturing weed-killers, insecticides, fertilisers, feeding-
stuffs and agricultural tractors and implements undertake research on a considerable
scale and in most cases maintain experimental farms and estates. They have been
responsible for developing a wide range of new, improved and safer products.
Agricultural Education
There are four types of institutions which provide full-time training in agricultural
subjects: universities, agricultural colleges, county farm institutes in England and
Wales, and farm schools in Scotland. Eight universities in England and Wales
INDUSTRY
293
(Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, London, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, and the
University of Wales), and three in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen)
provide degree courses in agriculture. The University of Bristol offers postgraduate
diploma courses. In Northern Ireland, a degree course is provided at Queen’s Univer¬
sity, Belfast. A National College of Agricultural Engineering is to be built next to the
National Institute of Agricultural Engineering at Silsoe, Bedfordshire. This will be the
eighth of the national colleges (see p. 169) established to train people for highly
specialised industries whose needs cannot be met at local technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses are given at five agricultural colleges and at two of the
county farm institutes in England and Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland
give two-year to three-year diploma courses. They are intended mainly for farmers
and farm managers, and lead to diplomas in agriculture, dairying, horticulture,
poultry husbandry and agricultural engineering. In Scotland, the three colleges also
offer two- or three-term certificate courses. In Northern Ireland there are three
agricultural colleges.
There are 32 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by local
education authorities, and Northern Ireland has one. They provide residential courses
in general agriculture, dairying, horticulture and poultry husbandry. These courses,
which are usually for one year of about 36 working weeks, are designed for those
wishing to become skilled workers in the industry. Local education authorities also
provide a wide range of short courses and classes for farmers, farmworkers,
horticulturists and domestic producers.
There are eight farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities, provid¬
ing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration for boys and girls
of from 12 to 16 years.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge and
London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
FISHERIES
Britain’s sea fishing industry falls into two main divisions, concerned respectively
with white fish and herring. White fish, such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole,
are demersal fish which live on or near the sea bed. Herring and similar species,
such as pilchard, mackerel and sprats, are pelagic fish which live in intermediate
waters or near the surface.
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three distinct groups: the
distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The distant waters
are those off Iceland, Greenland and the north coast of Norway, and the Barents
Sea; the middle water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water
grounds are those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around
Britain. The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore
waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
Fishing Ports
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring; in Scotland, the chief centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Leith, Fraser¬
burgh, the Moray Firth ports, Shetland, the west coast and the Clyde, and for herring
they are Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen, Shetland, and Stornoway, as well as the
294
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
west coast and the Clyde; those in Northern Ireland are Ardglass, Portavogie and
Kilkeel.
Methods of Sea Fishing
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring and
drift netting. In trawling, a funnel-shaped net of heavy twine is towed along the
sea bed. In seining, a funnel-shaped net with long wings is slowly hauled towards the
vessel, the long manila warps driving the fish into the path of the net. In lining,
long lines are made up with baited hooks at regular intervals and are laid over a
considerable area; deep sea lining can be carried out on grounds too rough for trawling,
as well as on smooth grounds. A limited number of Scottish vessels are engaged in this
fishery. Lining also provides employment, in autumn, winter and early spring, for a
large number of inshore fishermen fishing for cod, whiting and haddock. Ring netting,
mainly used by Scottish fishermen, is an efficient method of encircling shoals of pelagic
fish, such as herring or pilchard. In drift net fishing, a number of finely meshed nets,
attached to each other, form a vertical curtain of netting so that fish swimming against
them are caught by the gills. The vessel drifts with the wind and tide for a few hours,
usually starting at dusk, before hauling.
Trawling is carried out in the distant, near and middle waters for all species of
demersal fish throughout the year. Seining is also dependent upon demersal fish
and is operated all the year round. An increasing number of English, Scottish and
Northern Irish vessels depend on seining for a living, the main areas of operation
being in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There
are about 800 Scottish and Northern Irish seiners, and about 200 operate from
English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is a summer fishery for herring based on
the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east coast ports of
England, and an autumn fishery off East Anglia based on Lowestoft and Yarmouth.
Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland and off Southern
Ireland. The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and methods
of capture; trawling, seining, lining, and drift and ring net fishing are employed,
in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, prawns, cockles and
oysters, and, off Scotland and Northern Ireland, there is a fishery for ‘Norway
lobsters’ (nephrops).
The Fishing Fleet
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood,
numbered 239 at the end of 1959- They are over 140 feet and up to 260 feet in length
and make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in the Arctic Circle although
there has, in the past few years been an increasing tendency to fish the waters bordering
Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. The increase in fishing in these areas is
due in part to the introduction of factory trawlers which spend up to three months at
sea and fillet and freeze much of their catch immediately it is taken. At the same date,
near water vessels numbered 483; they are under 130 feet long and work near home,
making voyages of three to ten days. Middle water vessels numbered 73; they are 130
to 140 feet in length and undertake voyages of about two weeks. Included in the near
water group are vessels engaged in drift net fishing, which usually make daily voyages.
The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under 70 feet which are seldom at sea
for longer than two or three days and more usually make daily landings, often fishing;
within sight of land.

INDUSTRY
295
In the United Kingdom fishing industry in 1959 there were about 24,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 3,500 were occasionally employed; 10,000 of the
former and 1,200 of the latter were from Scottish ports. In Northern Ireland there
were 450 regular fishermen.
Supplies
In the year which ended on 31st December, 1959, landings of fish, both demersal
and pelagic, in the United Kingdom by British fishing vessels totalled 860,000 tons
(707,000 tons of demersal fish and 153,000 tons of pelagic), valued at about ^50-5
million. Landings at British ports by foreign vessels totalled about 93,000 tons of
fresh and frozen fish (including 36,000 tons brought direct from the fishing grounds),
valued at about £9 million. British landings of shellfish yielded £1-94 million. Cod
accounted for 41 per cent of the total value of wet fish (i.e. fish other than shellfish)
landed by British vessels; haddock (17 per cent) and plaice (9 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) into the United
Kingdom in 1959 amounted to about 193,000 tons valued at £53 million, including
56,000 tons of canned salmon to the value of £30 million and other canned fish worth
^9-6 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and imported
canned fish) in the United Kingdom averaged 15,900 tons landed weight in 1959.
On an edible (fillet) weight basis, United Kingdom consumption has been estimated
provisionally at 18-2 pounds per head in 1959, compared with 28-7 pounds in 1948
and an annual average of 21-8 pounds from 1934-38.
Northern Ireland consumes about one-third of the catch landed there by British
vessels (10,000 tons in 1959) and exports the rest to Great Britain.
Sea Fish Processing
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-freezing
for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and development. For
example, the production of quick-frozen fish has increased fivefold since 1952. With the
increase in quick-freezing, new export outlets have opened up for white fish, which
accounted for about half the total British exports of fish and fish products, valued at
£6 million in 1959. Markets abroad for quick-frozen fish, mainly in Europe and the
Commonwealth, have continued to expand, but exports of herrings, for which Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union have been large customers, have declined because of the
fall in total catches.
By-products
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for animal
food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of white fish meal
and herring meal has over the past three years remained constant at around 78,000
tons per annum. A large percentage of the fish meal is obtained from offal and most of
the remainder from unsold catches. Imports of fish meal of all kinds in 1959 totalled
147,000 tons. The preparation of vitamin oils from fish livers is also a source of addi¬
tional earnings. The oil is extracted at sea as soon as the fish are caught, and is later
refined ashore.
Freshwater Fisheries
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In Scotland
and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or draught nets in rivers
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
296
and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used for catching salmon in the
sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries. In England and Wales, the value of
the salmon catch is approximately £350,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to about
£1 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £200,000. In Northern Ireland, eels
worth £100,000 a year are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
Fishing for sport by rod and line in rivers, lakes, streams and canals is wide¬
spread. Salmon, grilse and sea-trout are the most important catches, and the fishing
rights command high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout and other
freshwater fish, e.g., roach, rudd, perch and dace; figures of catches are not available.
Distribution System
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market
in London, which handles about 350 tons a day, but other large cities also have
central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers,
located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers; the port
wholesalers prepare the fish for onward shipment. Some sixty special express fish
trains transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, but increasing use
is being made of road transport. Retail sales are handled by some 15,000 fishmongers
and nearly 15,000 fish friers; the latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Recent developments include the entry of trawler-owning companies into the
system of distribution. This process is being speeded by two factors: one is the
growing popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail
outlets as well as by fishmongers (10 per cent of fish sold in 1959 was estimated to be
quick-frozen); the other is the decline, from about 25,000 in 1950, in the number
of fried fish shops.
Promotion and Regulation of the Industry
Laws in Britain relating to fisheries and fish are principally directed to the following
purposes: (1) protection of supply by measures against over-fishing, e.g., the Sea
Fisheries Regulation Act, 1888, the Sea-Fishing Industry Act, 1933, and the Sea
Fish Industry Act, 1938; (2) promotion of the prosperity of the industry, e.g., the
Herring Industry Acts, 1935 to 1957, the White Fish Industry Acts, 1951 to 1957,
and the Fisheries Act, 1955 and the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1959; (3) protection of the
quality of the product, e.g., the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. The Government depart¬
ments mainly responsible for the administration of laws in the first two categories and
for the development of every branch of the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health and the
Department of Health for Scotland are concerned with questions of nutrition and
hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and welfare of crews of fishing
vessels are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered
by the Ministry of Transport.
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland,
the Northern Ireland Ministry of Commerce, the White Fish Authority, the Herring
Industry Board, and the Development Commissioners; and, on food investigation, the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
A Committee of Inquiry into the Fishing Industry was appointed in November
1957, to assess, in relation to developments in fishing and the marketing of fish, the
size and pattern of an economic fishing industry in the United Kingdom.
INDUSTRY
297
The Herring Industry Board
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of 1935
to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent amending
Acts have also been passed. The board consists of a chairman and two other members,
all part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Home Secretary. The board, whose activities are financed partly by Govern¬
ment grants and loans and partly by levies and licence fees, is advised by the Herring
Industry Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the catching and shore
sections of the industry.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both at
home and abroad, and the provision of grants and loans for the purchasing of new
boats, nets and gear, and the reconditioning of existing boats. The board is particularly
active in developing new and wider markets for herring, and applying the benefits
of technical progress to the industry, including the adoption of new fishing methods,
and the construction of new processing plants for quick-freezing and kippering. The
board buys all herring not sold for other purposes for reduction to oil and meal, and,
with the aid of Government grants, has built a number of processing factories for this
purpose.
The White Fish Authority
The White Fish Authority and the Scottish Committee of the Authority were set up
under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951. The function of the authority is to reorganise,
develop and regulate the white fish industry, and that of the Scottish Committee to
advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland.
The authority is composed of five independent members, and the Scottish Committee
of four under the chairmanship of a member of the authority. They are appointed
jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Home Secretary. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council was
also set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, to advise the authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions. It consists of 52 members representing the
various interests of the fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers the Government’s grant and loan schemes of
assistance to fishermen towards the purchase of new vessels and engines and for the
conversion of coal-burning engines to diesel or oil-firing and, as regards loans, towards
the cost of nets and gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March, i960, ^23-9 million
in loans and £9-3 million in grants were approved for these purposes by the authority.
Its other activities are financed by a levy on the first-hand sales of fish.
White Fish and Herring Subsidies
Since 1950 a Government subsidy has been paid to the owners of near and middle
water and inshore vessels fishing for white fish. This subsidy, which varies according
to the length and method of propulsion of the vessel, is paid at a rate of so much per
day at sea for the larger vessels and at so much per stone of fish landed from the small
boats. In 1959-60 the total sum expended in this way amounted to ^2-2 million.
In 1957 the subsidy was extended to cover herring. Conditions and rates are broadly
the same as for the white fish subsidy. The amount expended in 1959-60 totalled
^400,000.
Under the Sea Fish Industry Act, i959> which came into operation in December
1959, the provision available under the White Fish and Herring Industries Acts of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
298
1953 and 1957 for grants towards the cost of new vessels and engines, etc., was increased
from £9 million to £14 million and the amount available for white fish and herring
subsidies was increased from j£i9 million to ^24 million. The Act also included
provisions to extend the powers of the fisheries ministers to enable the United Kingdom
to play its full part in carrying out internationally agreed measures for the conservation
of fish stocks.
International Fisheries Conservation Convention
A new Fisheries Conservation Convention, covering the north-east Atlantic, was
signed in London in January 1959. The United Kingdom is among the signatories and
was the first to ratify the convention. The convention which, on full ratification, will
replace the one at present in force, which is more limited in scope, will make possible
further measures for conserving fish stocks throughout the north-east Atlantic Ocean
and its dependent seas (excluding the Baltic).
Whaling
Whaling is mainly conducted by expeditions, each consisting of a large floating
factory ship accompanied by its attendant whale catchers and tankers, which operate
mainly in the Antarctic Ocean. It is regulated by the International Whaling Commission,
set up under the International Whaling Convention of 1946, which controls the dates
of the season and has powers to set a limit on the Antarctic catch of whales. The
offices of the commission are in London.
Until i960 the United Kingdom industry ranked third in size, after those of Norway
and Japan, sending three expeditions to the Antarctic each year. But some reduction
in the number of United Kingdom expeditions is now expected. Whaling is also
undertaken from land stations on South Georgia, a British island in the South Atlantic.
The volume of whale oil obtained by the British expeditions in the 1959-60 season
amounted to about 289,000 barrels.
FORESTRY
The total woodland area of Great Britain is more than 4 million acres, or over
7 per cent of the total land area. Timber and its products are of great importance
to the economy of the country, and large quantities of industrial timber (i.e. wood
other than that used for domestic fuel) are needed to meet all demands; but, except
for the period of the second world war when, of necessity, much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have not been in a position to make more than a small con¬
tribution to the nation’s timber requirements. At present, Great Britain imports
about 85 per cent of its needs of timber and wood products. The Government is,
however, devoting continuous effort through the Forestry Commission to the long¬
term task of increasing the country’s timber resources.
Forest Areas
On 30th September, 1959, the area of woodland in blocks of one acre and over in
extent was estimated to be 4,075,000 acres of which about half were in England,
about two-fifths in Scotland and the rest in Wales. The greatest density of woodland
in Great Britain occurs in north, east and central Scotland and in the southern counties
of England, although afforestation is now increasing the importance of forestry in
many counties which were not previously heavily wooded. The classification of forest
area showing type and ownership in 1959 is given in Table 20.

(a) Forest owned by private individuals and bodies; in this classification a small area of com¬
munal forest is included, i.e. forest owned by public bodies such as local authorities and water
supply undertakings.
The high proportion of unproductive woodland, i.e. scrub and areas where trees
have been felled and partially felled, is largely a legacy of two wars when many woods
were felled to meet home demands for timber. During the past ten years the area of
this unproductive category has been reduced by about 150,000 acres, but the large
area which remains gives some indication of the problem of rehabilitation which
still lies ahead.
The most common of the coniferous tree species in Great Britain is probably
the Scots pine, but such trees as the Sitka and Norway spruce are also plentiful.
Of the broadleaved species, the most common tree is the oak, and there are considerable
numbers of beech, ash, birch, sycamore and elm.
Volume of Timber
On 30th September, 1959, the volume of standing timber in woodlands in Great
Britain, including that in hedgerows and in woods of less than one acre in extent,
was estimated to be 3>750 million hoppus feet.1 This consisted of i,45° mdlion hoppus
feet of softwood (derived from coniferous species) and 2,300 million hoppus feet of
hardwood (derived from broadleaved species). The net annual increment (the year s
growth minus losses due to fire, decay or similar causes) was about 112 million hoppus
feet. The climate and soil of Great Britain are such that the annual rate of growth of
timber which can be obtained under systematic management compares most favourably
with that achieved in other European countries.
Increased Use of Timber
From the early Middle Ages there was a continuous process of deforestation in
Great Britain. Woodlands were cleared for agriculture, and timber was used for a

variety of domestic and industrial purposes, for instance, as charcoal in iron-smelting,
for fuel, housebuilding, domestic and agricultural equipment, and shipbuilding.
Occasionally, from the sixteenth century onwards, the Government encouraged
the planting of high forest as an insurance against the blockade of war, but in times
of normal trading it was the practice to buy timber from abroad. Following the Indus¬
trial Revolution, cheap and easily workable timber began to be required in ever-
increasing amounts for a variety of new industrial uses. Home woodlands contained
neither the types nor the quantities of timber to meet this demand and the importation
of timber, principally of softwoods, expanded greatly. By 1914 the trade in imported
timber had grown, and the contribution from home woodlands had shrunk to a point
where no more than 7 per cent of the country’s total requirements were being met from
home sources. The sudden demands of the first world wrar, however, brought about a
realisation of the need for a national forest policy.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry Policy
In 1919, the Forestry Act was passed establishing the Forestry Commission as the
national forest authority, with the general duty of promoting the interests of forestry,
the development of afforestation and the production and supply of timber in Great
Britain. The commission consists of a chairman and not more than nine commissioners
who are appointed by the Crown; in exercising their functions, they are required to
comply with such directions as may be given to them by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Forestry Act, 1951,
placed responsibility for the licensing and felling of growing trees in Great Britain on
the Forestry Commissioners. Besides conducting its own forest operations, the
commission represents the interests of British forestry at inter-governmental meetings,
gives encouragement to private forestry and performs a wide range of general forestry
duties such as research and education and the publication of technical and other
literature on forestry. The commission also plays an important part in encouraging
the establishment of new timber-using industries. In the administration of its duties
in relation to private forestry there is continual contact between the commission’s
staff and private landowners, and the staff gives advice, free of charge, on silvicultural
and management problems; substantial grants for planting and other forestry
activities are paid to woodland owners (see p. 302).
In the years before the second world war, some progress was made by the com¬
mission in increasing the area under forest. During the war, however, extensive felling
was necessary to replace imports of timber and it became clear that vigorous measures
would be needed in post-war years if timber resources were to be replenished and
increased. In 1943, the Forestry Commissioners recommended, in their report on
post-war forestry policy, that the nation should aim at having at least 5 million acres
of productive forest, of which 2 million acres, mostly in private ownership, would
accrue from the rehabilitation of existing woodlands and 3 million acres from the
afforestation of bare land by the Forestry Commission. The acreage of woodland
proposed would, it was estimated, produce ultimately a volume of timber equivalent to
about one-third of the country’s needs. On this basis, forestry would become a major
industry which, in addition to its economic value, would help to arrest the depopulation
of rural areas.
In 1958, after reviewing forestry policy, the Government decided that the planting
programmes of the Forestry Commission should be fixed for periods of ten years at a
time. For the five-year period 1959 to 1963 the programme would be about 300,000
acres. For the period 1964 to 1968, the planting programme would be reduced to about
INDUSTRY
301
235,000 acres, by which time the Forestry Commission’s existing plantations would
begin to come into full production. The size of the subsequent programme is to
be reviewed in 1963.
Work of the Forestry Commission
By 30th September, 1959, forty years after the Forestry Act of 1919, the Forestry
Commission’s estate totalled over 2,400,000 acres of land, of which over 1,500,000
acres were forest land—plantations acquired or established by the commission, land
still to be planted, and nurseries—an area greater than the whole of the county of
Northumberland. The remainder of the land consisted of rough grazing and other
agricultural land, and land unsuitable for planting, such as the tops of mountains. The
total number of commission forests in Great Britain on 30th September, 1959, was
over 500, well distributed over England, Scotland and Wales. In 1954, the peak
year, the area planted was 70,400 acres; it decreased to 55,100 acres in 1959, owing
to the continuing difficulty of acquiring sufficient plantable land. All the commission’s
forests are covered by management plans, which provide for such work as planting,
road construction, thinning and fire protection.
Nearly half of the Forestry Commission’s new planting is being carried out in
Scotland, about a quarter of it in the Highland counties. The poorer types of land
are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable for other agricultural
purposes, and has become suitable for forestry only as a result of recent advances
in deep ploughing. Sand dunes are also used; on the southern shore of the Moray
Firth, Culbin Forest now covers 7,700 acres of land which had been unproductive
for centuries. Similarly, in Wales, 1,900 acres of sand dunes at Newborough, Anglesey,
and nearly 2,400 acres at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, are being successfully planted.
Over 15,000 people are employed on the staff of the commission, including 1,760
forest officers, foresters, land agents and engineers, 880 indoor staff—office workers and
draughtsmen—and 12,500 forest workers, lorry drivers, warreners, shepherds and
other manual workers. About £6 million a year is paid in wages. The commission
has acquired or built 4,600 houses and nearly 6,000 miles of road.
Large-scale planting expands opportunities for employment, not only for forest
workers but for the communities in which they live. This expansion is taking place
particularly in the remote uplands where formerly there was a steady exodus of young
people to the towns. In these places the work of the commission, which includes the
establishment of completely new villages, has often reversed this trend and increased
the proportion of young people in the communities.
Many of the commission’s staff combine forestry and farming. Since 1919 the com¬
mission has established over 1,000 ‘forest workers’ holdings’, each of a few acres, where
the tenant agrees to do a minimum of 150 days’ work each year in the forest.
Integration of forestry and agriculture is practised in marginal hill areas. An example
of this is the ‘ Strathoykell’ scheme which is proceeding in adjoining sheep-farming
areas in Ross and Sutherland, in Scotland. In this area a substantial acreage has been
planted by the Forestry Commission, houses have been built, grant-aided farm improve¬
ments have been made, and stocks of sheep and cattle have been increased.
Finance
The Forestry Fund was established by the Forestry Act, 1919; from it is paid all
the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid their receipts
from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with the amounts voted
annually by Parliament. From 1920 to 1959, net grants from Parliament totalled ^107-8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3°2
million and receipts from other sources £35-4 million. Expenditure during these years
totalled £142-8 million. In the year ended 30th September, 1959, expenditure amounted
to £13-1 million, of which £904,000 represented various grants to private forestry.
The value of the produce of the plantations totalled nearly £28 million by 30th
September, 1959, and now amounts to over £2 million annually. The Forestry Com¬
mission’s forest estate is now conservatively value at over £140 million. The eventual
yield on the public money invested in the commission’s estate (money that must
normally be invested in land that is marginal for agriculture, not the most productive
forest land) is expected to be about 3 per cent, compound interest.
Private Forestry
Privately owned woods in 1959 comprised 67 per cent of the total forest area in
Great Britain (as shown in Table 20), and contain most of the mature and semi-
mature timber. The size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few
acres to several thousand acres, and a high proportion of the privately owned woodland
area belongs to small owners (i.e. owners of woods of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands by
the introduction, under the Forestry Act, 1947, of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme.
Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently to timber
production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan agreed with the
Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of planting and management grants
and technical assistance. By September 1959 t°tal area dedicated was 576,000
acres. In addition, there are the woodlands covered by the Approved Woodlands
Scheme in which a planting grant, but no management grant, is made; and these
bring the total area managed under an agreed plan to over 730,600 acres. This does
not take into account other estates that are already working to a plan but have not
been put forward for inclusion in either scheme. Woodland owners are represented,
in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry Committee of
Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations of woodland owners, the
Timber Growers’ Association (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish
Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co-operative
forestry schemes and have made loans available. The co-operative societies provide
for landowners and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities,
and a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The whole of Scotland, a
number of areas in Wales and several districts in England are now served by such
societies. The commission also co-operates with the principal forestry societies,
such as the Royal Forestry Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish
Forestry Society, in disseminating technical knowledge.
The total area estimated to have been planted annually by private owners has
risen from 9,000 acres in 1947 to 34,800 acres in i959» compares with a pre-war
average of 6,000 to 7,000 acres.
In 1959, the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established by the
timber merchants. Its aims are to promote the use of home grown timber, to investi¬
gate new markets, to help merchants to meet the bulk demands of industry and to
ensure a high standard of quality and service for consumers.
Consultative Machinery
The Forestry Act, 1945, established national committees for England, Scotland
and Wales, composed partly of forestry commissioners and partly of persons outside
INDUSTRY
3°3
the commission. These committees, working directly under the authority of the com¬
missioners, supervise certain aspects of the commission’s work, including particularly
the acquisition and management of land and the promotion of private forestry; in
the latter task they are required to maintain direct contact with the regional advisory
committees which have been set up in each of the commission’s conservancies with
the purpose of providing a link with all those in the conservancy who are interested in
forestry. On all proposals for acquisition of land, the commission consults the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing and
utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee,
established by the Forestry Commissioners in 1939, consists of representatives of the
Forestry Commission, the Board of Trade and associations of landowners and timber
merchants; it meets quarterly to discuss various matters affecting the marketing of
home grown timber. In 1949, the Forestry Commissioners set up the Advisory Com¬
mittee on Utilisation of Home Grown Timber to advise landowners and to undertake
research into problems connected with the marketing of timber from the commission’s
own forests. Among the members of this committee are representatives of the Forest
Products Research Laboratory (see below), the Rural Industries Bureau (see p. 257)
and the Timber Development Association.
Forestry Education and Research
The Forestry Commission maintains four forester training schools: in England, at
Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near Bettws-y-Coed in
Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Benmore, Argyllshire, and Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the commission’s
educational centre, and is used for practical courses for university students, land-
owners and agents, planning officers, school teachers and others connected with, or
interested in, forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a proportion of
suitable graduates is recruited by the commission as forest officers.
The commission’s forest research station at Alice Holt Lodge, near Farnham,
Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this station and in
experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted to £340,000 in 1959.
The commission makes grants for special forestry research work to various institutions
and to university departments including the Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford,
which is also financed by the University, the Colonial Office, and Colonial Govern¬
ments. Research into the qualities of home grown timber is carried out by the Forest
Products Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, which is one of the
establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and also by
grant-aided research associations.
The Forestry Commission has played a leading part in the Commonwealth Forestry
Conference, since its first meeting in 1920; the seventh meeting was held in Australia
and New Zealand in 1957. The commission is also closely associated with the work
of the International Union of Forest Research Organisations, whose twelfth congress
was held at Oxford in 1956.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922) the new Ministry
of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar powers and duties
to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the Forestry Act, 1919- -^t that
3°4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
time the ministry took over some 4,000 acres for afforestation, of which 700 acres
had been planted.
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is now implemented by the Forestry Act (Northern
Ireland), 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act provides the ministry
with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give financial and technical assistance
for private planting. It introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands, whether
owned by the State or privately owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or
depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace since the
end of the second world war. By i960, over 100,000 acres had been acquired, of
which nearly 55,000 acres had been planted. The present afforestation programme
provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an area of 150,000 acres of productive
State forest. To reach this objective, a minimum annual planting rate of 5,000 acres
has been set.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and receipts
from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1922 to i960, expenditure
amounted to about million, and receipts, other than parliamentary grants, were
in the region of £2-5 million. Output and employment are growing steadily. About
2,000 people are employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable
private woodlands is at present about 20,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young trees
from the ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the establishment of new
plantations, and by free technical advice.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal, petroleum
and, to a small extent, water power; secondary sources produced from these are
electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies some three-quarters of this energy and it
will remain the principal source for many years to come. For supplies of crude
petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports; water power resources are
small. A large-scale programme is in hand for the construction of nuclear power
stations.
The pattern of energy consumption has shown marked changes in recent years.
Consumption of coal was 12 per cent lower in 1959 than in 1955, while that of oil
was 57 per cent higher and represented nearly one-quarter of total energy consumption.
Electricity consumption continued its steady rise and in 1959 was 31 per cent higher
than in 1955, while that of gas was 4 per cent lower.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry,
are under public ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and
co-ordinated development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister of
Power. Fuel research is undertaken by the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research as well as by the individual industries.
The Government’s long-term policy, based on freedom of choice for consumers and
economic competition between the fuel industries, has two principal objectives.
The first is to ensure that fuel and power supplies are adequate to meet fully and at
minimum cost the rapidly growing demands of industry and of the domestic consumer
in a country with an expanding national income. The second is to make the best use of
indigenous resources and so lighten the load on the balance of payments.
INDUSTRY
305
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in
any other European country. British coal exports dominated the world market until
about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry was producing 287
million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing over a million workers.
The very fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant that many
of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has to be mined from
deeper and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained only by a high level
of investment.
The industry declined during the first world war owing to shortage of manpower
and of the plant and materials necessary for undertaking any mechanical improvement.
Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices in other countries led to a
later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67 million tons by 1925.
Attempts to secure economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey Com¬
mission of 1919. In 1930, a Coal Mines Act established commissioners to bring
about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act of 1938 trans¬
ferred ownership of mineral coal to the State and made it the statutory responsibility
of a Coal Commission to accelerate the integration of the industry by reducing still
further the number of separate undertakings. At the outbreak of the second world
war in 1939, however, this process was not far advanced. In 1942, the Government
assumed full control of the industry’s operations, though the colliery undertakings
continued to own the coal mines.
The National Coal Board
In July 1946, the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act was passed and brought the
industry under public ownership; by this Act, all its assets—coal mines, mineral rights
and ancillary undertakings—were vested on 1st January, 1947* in the National Coal
Board, which became responsible for the industry’s management, compensation
being paid to the former owners. Under the Coal Industry Act, i949> the board, which
is appointed by the Minister of Power and is responsible through him to Parliament,
consists of a chairman and not fewer than eight or more than 11 other members;
the number of full-time members must not exceed eight and there must be one, and
may be two, deputy chairmen.
The National Coal Board has the exclusive monopoly to mine coal in Great Britain,
though it may license privately owned undertakings to work small mines not employing
more than 30 underground workers, and also to work opencast sites where the total
output is not expected to exceed 25,000 tons. The board has statutory duties to develop
the industry efficiently and to ensure the safety, health and welfare of its employees.
Its policies must be directed to ensure that on an average of good and bad years its
outgoings do not exceed its revenues.
The board is responsible for its own regional organisation. The collieries, numbering
about 730, are grouped into 48 areas which are the basic units for commercial manage¬
ment; their size varies according to geological, geographical and other technical
considerations. The areas are grouped into nine divisions which roughly correspond to
the main coal-bearing regions. A divisional board for each division supervises and
co-ordinates the work of the areas (except in the small south-eastern division, which is
administered by a general manager), formulates divisional policy, and is answerable to
the National Coal Board, which is responsible for questions of national policy, finance
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3°6
and the co-ordinating of major schemes of development. The day-to-day work of
running the collieries is under the direction of colliery managers. The board, however,
has no monopoly of sales or distribution. It makes some wholesale sales to large
consumers and also in a few areas, retail sales, but most retail distribution is carried
on by private firms.
Two Coal Consumers’ Councils were set up under the 1946 Act: the Industrial
Coal Consumers' Council, members of which represent consumers, merchants and
suppliers of coal, coke and manufactured fuel for industrial and other purposes,
involving supply in bulk; and the Domestic Coal Consumers' Council, members of
which represent similar groups concerned with coal for domestic use. These two
councils have the duty of considering and where necessary reporting to the Minister
of Power on any matter affecting the sale or supply of these fuels.
In its first year, 1947, the board had a deficit of £23-3 million, and since then
has made surpluses in some years and deficits in others. The cumulative deficit at
the end of 1959 amounted to £52 million.
The National Coal Board raises capital by long-term borrowing direct from the
Exchequer, instead of through the issue of stock. There is a statutory limit of £750
million at present on such borrowing and borrowing above £700 million must be
authorised by Order in Council.
Production and Manpower
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for about
400 to 500 years at current rates of consumption. But certain types such as high
quality coking coal will be exhausted long before then unless they are eked out by
blending with other types of coal.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field, which produces about 45 per cent of the total output, (2) the Durham
and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.
Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the West Midlands
(Staffordshire and Warwickshire). There are no coal-bearing areas in Northern
Ireland. Prospecting for coal continues both inland and off the north-east coast of
England.
In the early years following nationalisation, the National Coal Board was able
to secure quick increases in production and productivity by reorganisation, by a
wider application of improved working methods and by increased mechanisation.
As a result, deepmined production increased from 187 million tons in 1947 to 214
million tons in 1954. Production remained roughly stationary until 1957, but declined
to 195-3 million tons of deepmined coal in 1959 owing to a fall in demand. Output
in tons per manshift worked at the coal face has increased gradually and in 1959
reached 3-73 tons compared with 3-34 tons in 1954 and 3-05 tons in 1938. The com¬
parable figures in 1959 for the division with the highest output per manshift—the
East Midlands division—was 5-56 tons.
To meet the fall in demand, the board reduced opencast production (from 14 million
tons in 1958 to 9 million tons in 1959) and accelerated the closure of uneconomic pits.
Future plans are directed towards bringing efficient new mines into production,
the development of machines for power-loading the coal at the face on to face-conveyor
belts and the reorganisation of the haulage systems. The National Coal Board has
launched a large programme of major reconstruction and new sinkings.
During the post-war years until 1957, the industry suffered from a shortage of
manpower. Latterly, however, because of falling demand and rising stocks the numbers
INDUSTRY
307
employed fell to 634,000 (of whom 243,000 were employed at the coal face) at the end
of 1959 compared with 704,000 (with 295,000 at the coal face) at the end of 1953,
and recruiting has been temporarily restricted in certain areas.
Consumption and Overseas Trade
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of 3 million
tons between 1947 and 1956 and, to cover requirements in certain years, supplies
had to be imported from the United States. After 1956, inland sales fell and totalled
190-5 million tons in 1959. The reasons for the decline included the pause in the
expansion of industrial production, the growing competition from oil and increasing
efficiency in the use of coal.
Table 21 summarises the pattern of coal consumption in Britain in the years 1957-59.
The electricity authorities took about one-quarter of total supplies, much of it in the
form of small coal not suitable for other uses.

Coal exports have fallen heavily in relation to pre-war levels, due, at first, partly
to increased internal consumption and, more recently, to keener competition in a
diminishing market. In 1959* exports of coal, coke and briquettes amounted to 5-5
million tons valued at ^23-9 million, the principal markets being Denmark, the Irish
Republic, Norway and Sweden.
Safety, Health and Welfare
The safety, health and welfare of miners are safeguarded by comprehensive legis¬
lation, which was consolidated and brought up to date by the Mines and Quarries
Act, 1954. Responsibility for the enforcement of safety regulations lies with the
Mines and Quarries Inspectorate of the Ministry of Power.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation and, in accordance with
the Nationalisation Act, follows a policy directed towards securing the safety, health
and welfare of its employees; examples of voluntary action by the board to reduce
risks are the installation of fire-resistant conveyor belts, the replacement of light
alloy supports (which had been found to be liable to produce dangerous sparks)
and the widespread introduction of courses of training for various classes of officials

and workmen. The board has also continued to strengthen the medical services which
existed before nationalisation. Chief divisional and area medical officers have been
appointed and assistant medical officers are being appointed in areas with a labour
force of more than 15,000 men. Medical centres are being set up at the pit head.
The board is responsible for its employees’ welfare at their work-places, for example,
by providing pit-head baths and canteens, while the social welfare of coalminers and
their families has, since 1952, been the responsibility of the Coal Industry Social
Welfare Organisation, which is controlled by the board and the miners’ trade unions.
Research into problems of safety and health is carried out also at the Ministry
of Power’s Safety in Mines Research Establishment, which maintains a close liaison
with the Mines Inspectorate and the National Coal Board’s research organisation.
Air Pollution
The Government also aims to reduce air pollution. The Clean Air Act, 1956, which
came fully into force on 1st June, 1958, makes it an offence to emit dark smoke or fail
to provide industrial premises with equipment to arrest grit and dirt, and empowers
local authorities, subject to the approval of the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment or the Secretary of State for Scotland, to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which
the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes an offence; grants may be made by
local authorities and by the Exchequer towards the costs incurred by owners and
occupiers of premises in these areas in making necessary changes to appliances. Clean
Air Councils, to review progress and to advise the Government were set up in 1957.
By the end of March i960, 258 smoke control areas had been confirmed by the ministers.
Development and Research
Contraction and curtailment of development in the industry since the peak year,
1913, had led to a position in which, by 1950, less than one-third of current output
was being obtained from pits started in the twentieth century. Large-scale development
was therefore essential.
Capital Investment
The National Coal Board’s long-term plan of development for the industry involves
the reorganisation and increased mechanisation of existing mines and the sinking of
new ones. First published in 1950, it was considerably revised in 1956; and three years
later, in October 1959, a further revision was announced. The last provides for the
investment of ^511 million in the period 1960-65, by which date 80 per cent of coal
output will be coming from new and reconstructed collieries. Capital expenditure by
the industry totalled £462 million from 1947 to 1955, and £414-5 million in the four
years 1956 to 1959.
Mechanisation
All but a small proportion of coal output is now mechanically cut and conveyed.
In 1959, 62 per cent, or 119 million tons, was mechanically cleaned; each man at a
mechanically worked coal face produced an average of 6-5 tons per shift; and one-third
was power-loaded.
Research
In 1948, the National Coal Board established a central research organisation,
the Coal Research Establishment, at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucester¬
shire, to provide facilities for fundamental research in the coalmining industry, as
distinct from the day-to-day scientific control exercised by the divisional and area
INDUSTRY
309
scientific organisation. A second central research organisation for the investigation of
underground problems, the Mining Research Establishment, was formed in 1952 by the
board at Isleworth, Middlesex, and a Central Engineering Establishment for developing
new machines and testing equipment is now operating near Bretby, Derbyshire.
The board also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR),
including the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, the British Coke Research
Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition, much of the work of
other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment of the Ministry
of Power, is closely related to the board’s problems. In 1947, the National Coal Board
took over, with other assets, the Coal Survey, a national organisation for surveying
coal resources within Britain, and 70 laboratories (in the various coalfields), which it has
since extended and modernised.
In 1959, the board set up a new department concerned primarily with the develop¬
ment of new processes for the making of smokeless briquettes from small coal. Research
at the Coal Research Establishment at Stoke Orchard had already led to a promising
new process. A committee was appointed by the Minister of Power, in April 1959, to
investigate possible methods of converting coal into chemicals, gas and oil, and
recommend further research and development work on any processes that appear to
hold promise of industrial application.
PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young, a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural mineral
oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits, yielding
similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including oil extracted from shale) supply
altogether less than one per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder
being imported from overseas.
Crude oil is extracted from shale at five shale mines and one opencast quarry
and retorted in two crude oil works. Output of shale reached a peak of 3-4 million
tons in 1913, but the cost of the processes and other economic difficulties led to a
reduction of output. Production amounted to some 710,000 tons in i959> yielding
over 60,000 tons of crude shale oil. From the latter, some 57>50° t°ns °f refined
products were obtained. Some 265)000 tons of refined benzole were derived from coke
ovens and gasworks. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment
of several small oilfields in Nottinghamshire (Eakring, Egmanton and Bothamsall),
in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough) and in Lancashire
(Formby). Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields totals about 83,000
tons. At Broadbench, Dorset, a single boring has found oil, possibly in commercial
quantities. This is the first oil strike in the south of England during the post-war search.
Indigenous crude oil both from shale and from oil wells is refined at Pumpherston,
near Edinburgh.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
310
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Today these companies produce about one-third of all oil entering into international
trade, with a tanker fleet (part owned by them and part on charter) amounting to
nearly one-third of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered tanker
tonnage is nearly one-sixth of the world’s total.)
In 1959, the United Kingdom imported 39-6 million tons of crude oil, valued at
^313-6 million; nearly half came from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers being
Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela, in that order.
Consumption
Inland consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom, apart from a
slight drop in 1957, has been expanding rapidly and in 1959 reached 36-5 million tons.
An outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance in use of black oils;
fuel oil consumption rose from 6-9 million tons in 1957 to 13-8 million tons in 1959,
the chief factor being the large increase in power station usage; while the use of gas
and diesel oil rose to over 3 million tons. Motor spirit sales rose to 7-1 million tons.
Refineries
Before 1939, three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum products
was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical at that time to refine at the
source of production. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to
favour the siting of refineries in the consuming areas. The expansion programme in the
United Kingdom carried out by the major oil companies between 1947 and 1958
cost nearly £300 million.
By the end of April i960, refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to some
43 million tons a year. Of the 15 refineries then in operation, six have a capacity of
under 0-2 million tons. The largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton (12
million tons), Shellhaven (8 million tons) and Isle of Grain (7 million tons), both on the
Thames Estuary, and Stanlow (5 million tons), in Cheshire. Anew refinery at Milford
Haven, in Pembrokeshire, costing some ^18 million and with a capacity of nearly 5
million tons, started in i960.
Production of refined products rose from 4 million tons in 1948 to the record
total of 35-3 million tons in 1959. There is a substantial external trade in refined
products which tends to follow trading and seasonal requirements and the com¬
mercial arrangements of the oil companies. United Kingdom exports, mainly in
the form of heavier products to European countries, were valued at ^100 million
in 1959; imports of refined products were valued at £153 million.
Oil Pipelines
There are at present three major oil pipelines in Britain. Two of these—one in
Scotland (from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth) and one in South Wales (from
Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy)—are designed to carry crude oil from harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers to existing refineries; and one, from Walton-
on-Thames to London Airport, is designed to carry aviation fuel. In addition a
pipeline from Shellhaven refinery to Romford gasworks carries refinery gas and gas¬
making products. The major oil companies are now interested in building pipe¬
lines to take refined products from refineries to major marketing areas, where the
volume transported is sufficient to justify the capital cost. Among the new pipelines
under construction or proposed is one to carry refined products between Stanlow,
Cheshire, and Urmston, near Manchester; another is to take petroleum feedstock from
INDUSTRY
311
Fawley refinery to the £100 million petroleum chemicals project near Bristol; and
another is to transport aviation spirit and aviation turbine fuel from Fawley to London
Airport. Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid during the second world
war are being used by the petroleum distributing companies.
Research
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities on a
substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames (the British
Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock, in Kent (Shell),
and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). Research covers the evolution of new and improved
lubricants, the development of new uses for oil and of new products based on oil,
especially chemicals.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
Public supply of electricity was first provided in 1881, at Godaiming, Surrey,
though there were earlier demonstrations of its use to consumers, such as the lighting
of the Thames Embankment by the former Metropolitan Board of Works. From
its earliest days a measure of public control has been a feature of the industry,
and the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, authorised the Board of Trade to grant licences
for the establishment of electricity undertakings by local authorities or by companies
(which the local authorities might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time)
to supply consumers in given areas. By the turn of the century, technical developments,
including the introduction of the electric motor as a source of motive power, had led
to a large increase in the scale of distribution of electricity, and a variety of independent
supply systems had grown up all over the country.
It was not until after the first world war that steps were taken to reorganise the
industry on a national scale in order to realise the benefits of concentration, integration
and standardisation in electricity supply. In 1919, the Electricity Commissioners
were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation through voluntary
agreement. Then, in 1926, the Central Electricity Board was established to co-ordinate
more efficiently the generation of electricity. Its main duties were to concentrate the
output of electricity in certain stations, selected for their efficiency and low operating
costs, and to connect these selected stations with one another and with local distribution
undertakings by means of a national system of main transmission lines, known as the
‘grid’. Thenceforward, steady progress was made in putting this plan into effect and,
by March 1948, 143 selected stations, out of some 300, were supplying 95 per cent of
the electricity generated for public supply.
Organisation under Public Ownership
Under the Electricity Act of 1947, a central authority, then known as the British
Electricity Authority, and 14 Area Electricity Boards took over in April 1948 the
assets of former municipal and private electricity supply undertakings throughout
Great Britain, except in the area already served by the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board (see p. 312). Under the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act of
1954, the authority’s functions in Scotland were taken over in April 1955, by the
South of Scotland Electricity Board (see p. 313). The name of the authority was
changed from British Electricity Authority to Central Electricity Authority and the
number of area boards was reduced to 12.
L
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
312
On ist January, 1958, under the Electricity Act, 1957, the Central Electricity
Authority was dissolved and replaced by two new bodies, the Electricity Council
and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
The present organisation of the electricity supply industry, in which more than
200,000 people are employed, is described below.
England and Wales
The Electricity Council, the central body of the industry, is composed of a chair¬
man, two deputy chairmen, not more than three other persons, and the chairman
and two other members of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and, ex officio,
the 12 chairmen of the Area Electricity Boards. The main functions of the council
are to advise the Minister of Power on matters relating to the electricity supply
industry and to promote and assist the maintenance and development by electricity
boards in England and Wales of an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of
electricity supply. More specifically, the council is responsible for a number of common |
services, including capital financing and research.
The Central Electricity Generating Board consists of a chairman and not fewer
than seven, nor more than nine, other members. The board has taken over certain
of the executive functions of the former Central Electricity Authority in England
and Wales: i.e. to generate or acquire supplies of electricity and to provide bulk
supplies to the area boards.
The Area Boards (of which there are at present 12) are responsible for the distribution
and sale of electricity. Each consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman
and four to six members (mostly part-time), appointed by the Minister of Power.
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act, 1947, in the area
of each board to represent the interests of consumers. They each consist of between
20 and 30 members, of whom between 40 and 60 per cent are nominated by local
authority associations. The chairman of each area consultative council is an ex officio
member of the corresponding area board. These arrangements continue under the
Act of 1957.
The most important functions of the Minister of Power in England and Wales
under the new arrangements are: to appoint the chairmen, deputy chairmen and
members of the Electricity Council, the Central Electricity Generating Board and the
Area Boards; to approve each area board’s capital development plans and the industry s
research programme; and to approve, in consultation with the Treasury, the boards
borrowing requirements, having regard to the development programmes submitted
by the industry. The minister also has power to issue general directions to the council
and the boards if he considers this necessary in the national interest.
The Central Electricity Authority (and its successors the Electricity Council and
the Central Electricity Generating Board) together with the area boards, have made
a consolidated net surplus on their operations in each of the years since they were
established. Up to and including the financial year 1958-59, these surpluses amounted
in the aggregate to over ^125 million. Under the 1957 Act, each electricity board, not
merely the industry as a whole, must pay its own way, taking one year with another.
Scotland
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was set up in 1943 as a public corpora¬
tion to develop the water power resources of the Highlands and Islands and to distribute
electricity in the more sparsely populated parts of Scotland not covered by existing
undertakings. The board consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and not fewer
INDUSTRY
3I3
than four nor more than eight other members, appointed by the Secretary of State
for Scotland.
The Act of 1947 made the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board solely responsible
to the Secretary of State for Scotland for all generation and distribution in its area.
This area was extended under the Act to include that part of Scotland north and west
of a line running roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on
the Firth of Tay.
On 1 st April, 1955, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, took over the then British Electricity Authority’s
functions in Scotland, and also the functions of the two area boards in the south
of Scotland, which were dissolved. The board consists of a chairman, deputy chairman,
and not fewer than four nor more than eight other members, appointed by the Secretary
of State for Scotland.
Under the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954, the then Minister of
Fuel and Power retained only three functions in regard to electricity in Scotland,
namely, to act jointly with the Secretary of State on matters relating to staff pensions
and to safety measures, and to remain solely responsible for the certification of meters.
A consultative council has been appointed for the district of each board by the
Secretary of State, to represent the interests of consumers. The constitutions of these
councils are similar to those of the area consultative councils, and the chairman of
each is a member of the appropriate board.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
Londonderry and at Ballylumford, Larne and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast and
Londonderry are owned and operated by the city corporations and the remainder by
the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland. Generation at these stations is co-ordinated
by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee, set up by statute in 1948, which
purchases their output and resells it to distributors—the Belfast Corporation, for
Belfast and district, and the Electricity Board for the rest of Northern Ireland.
Generation
Most of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generating stations.
Abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water transport for moving
it, in contrast to the remote and scattered location of relatively small water power
resources, led to this preponderant development of electricity supplies from thermal
generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is comparatively
recent.
The installed generating capacity of the electricity authorities (including the North
of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) in Great Britain at the end of 1959 totalled 30,015
megawatts (MW), an increase of about 35 per cent since 1955. In each year recently
about 2,000 MW of new plant have on average been brought into commission.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where the total installed generating capacity
of 444 MW is in coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 1,168 million kilowatt-
hours in 1959.
In 1959, over 100,000 million kilowatt-hours, or slightly under 98 per cent of the
public supply in Great Britain, was generated at conventional thermal stations,
and the remainder from water power, diesel engines, nuclear stations and waste heat
and refuse destruction. The high rate of expansion of output, which has been a feature
of the industry since its earliest years, has been continued since the war. Total
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3I4
production in 1959 was some ten times that of 1930, and had increased by 45 per
cent since 1954.
Conventional Thermal
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in Britain,
and although more than nine-tenths was coal, oil consumption rose from a negligible
quantity in 1955 to 4 million tons in 1959. Average thermal efficiency of conventional
steam stations in England and Wales (i.e. the ratio of power output to the fuel con¬
sumed) rose from 21-9 per cent in 1947 to 26-36 per cent in 1959 as new P^ant was
brought into use. Twenty stations containing much of the newest plant had an average
efficiency of 30-67 per cent in that year.
The Central Electricity Generating Board will have in commission by 1962 a
generating set of 275 MW capacity, and, a year later, a 550 MW set is due to be com¬
missioned at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster. The latter is much larger than any now
in operation. These large machines will show substantial economies in capital cost, in
fuel consumption and in operational costs. At present, the largest machine in operation
is the 200 MW set at High Marnham, in the east Midlands. Station capacities are also
increasing; the largest station under construction is the Drakelow ‘C’ station, which
will have an ultimate capacity of some 1,500 MW and will use generating sets of 350
MW. Stations of 2,000 MW capacity are envisaged within the next few years.
Hydro-Electric
The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 marked the
beginning of a new era of intensive water power development in the Highlands of
Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the board in 1944, showing the water
power resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102 hydro-electric projects
with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million units of electricity. In 1959, 1,836
million units were generated from water power compared with 322 million in 1949-
At the end of 1959, there were 48 full-scale hydro-electric stations in operation in
Scotland with a total capacity of 988 MW and the largest—the Loch Sloy station—
had a capacity of 130 MW; further hydro-electric schemes with a total capacity of
555 MW were under consideration and of 582 MW at the constructional stage.
Alternative Fuels
To meet increasing demands for electricity, generation from primary energy sources
other than coal is being developed. The chief alternatives are oil and nuclear energy.
As regards oil, dual firing apparatus able to use either coal or oil has been installed in
eleven new power stations, situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed con¬
veniently from nearby oil refineries. Another alternative, used in Scotland, is peat;
a pilot gas turbine project at Altnabreac, Caithness, has been in experimental operation
since June 1958.
Nuclear Power Stations
As an extension of its experimental work and to produce plutonium, the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has built two stations which also
produce electricity—at Calder Hall, Cumberland, and Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire,
both of about 150 MW output capacity. The first started operating in May 1956
and was officially connected to the grid by the Queen in October that year; the second,
Chapelcross, started supplying electricity in February 1959, and up to 1st June, i960,
these two nuclear power stations had produced over 2,500 million units of electricity
for the national grid.
INDUSTRY
3I5
The main commercial power stations under the Government’s nuclear power
programme are being built for the electricity authorities by groups of engineering
firms specially organised for the construction of nuclear power plants.
Special factors have to be taken into account in the siting of the nuclear power stations,
notably the need for firm rock foundations to bear the weight of the reactors and their
supporting structure, a location distant from heavily built-up areas, and plentiful
supplies of water for cooling.
Six stations are under construction and another has been approved; all seven, with
a total output capacity of about 3,000 MW, should be in operation by 1966. In June
i960 the Government announced modifications in the earlier programme, to take
account of the fact that coal had become plentiful and oil supplies had also improved.
The intention now is to place orders at the rate of roughly one station a year. As
it is expected that it will be possible to increase the capacity of stations over the years,
there will be a steady rise in the rate of commissioning of nuclear generating capacity,
which should total about 5,000 MW in 1968.
The stations at Bradwell (300 MW output capacity), in Essex, and at Berkeley (275
MW), in Gloucestershire, begun in January 1957, are due for completion by 1961.
The Binkley Point station (500 MW), in Somerset, and the Hunterston station (320
MW), in Ayrshire, should be in operation by 1963. Provision is being made for a
possible doubling of capacity at Binkley Point. At the end of June 1959, work started
on a fifth nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd (50° MW), in North Wales, also
expected to be completed by 1963. A contract has been placed for a 500/550 MW
station at Dungeness, in Kent, which in addition to feeding current into the national
grid will be linked with the power cable to France (see p. 316).
Consent has been given to the erection of a nuclear station at Sizewell, in Suffolk,
and is being sought for one at Oldbury, in Gloucestershire.
Technical advances are already enabling nuclear power stations with greatly increased
output to be constructed. Thus the stations at Dungeness and Sizewell are expected
to have output capacities of about 550 MW (the largest so far projected in the world),
and one of as much as 1,000 MW is envisaged for the second phase of the station
at Oldbury.
Sites for additional stations are being considered at various points on the south coast
of England and in North Wales. The Northern Ireland Electricity Board is planning
to build a station on a site yet to be determined.

In order that nuclear power stations with their higher capital costs and lower
operating costs should be run as continuously as possible, pumped storage schemes
are being developed. Construction of a 300 MW pumped storage scheme started at
Blaenau Ffestiniog, near Trawsfynydd, in North Wales, in i95^> an<^ suitable sites
for other such schemes are being investigated. The first large-scale pumped storage
works in Scotland, comprising a 400 MW combined pumping and generating plant
costing some -£24<5 million, forms part of the Loch Awe project, work on which started
in May 1959.
Sites in Northern Ireland suitable for this type of project are being surveyed.
Transmission and Distribution
Main electricity transmission lines—the National Grid cover most of the country.
In 1959, those of the Central Electricity Generating Board totalled some 6,300 route
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3l6
miles (10,400 circuit miles), of which 819 miles were operated at 275,000 volts, 5,157
miles were operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts and below.
In Scotland, there were 2,801 circuit miles of main transmission lines at the end of
1959, of which 170 circuit miles operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000
volts. Energy movements on the grid in England and Wales are controlled through the
seven operational areas, set up for that purpose and distinct from the divisions in
which the generating side of the industry is organised; each area has a separate control,
and the operations are co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in
Scotland is operated from the North of Scotland control centre at Tummel Bridge
and the South of Scotland control centre at Kirkintilloch.
The new ‘supergrid’ of main transmission lines at 275,000 volts will help to meet
the growing demand for electricity during the next 20 years and will make the British
electricity supply the most closely integrated power network in the world. A link
interchange of energy by direct current by means of a single cross-Channel cable
capable of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current) is expected
to be in operation by 1961. It is estimated to cost ^4 million. Its object is to take advan¬
tage of the differences between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales, the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers electricity
acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board, but in part from
other sources, e.g., collieries. There are over 15 million consumers, an increase of about
6 million on those supplied in December 1939. Industrial concerns are the biggest
users of electricity and their demands are increasing rapidly. The principal domestic
uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking, and for space and water heating, but the
demand for numerous other domestic purposes is increasing rapidly.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with the
distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. At the end of 1959,
there were 384,242 consumers of electricity in the board’s district and 66-9 per cent
of the farms and crofts had a supply of electricity. At the same date the South of
Scotland Electricity Board supplied 1,342,487 consumers, including about 93 per
cent of the farmers in the area.
Capital Investment
About 8 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United Kingdom
is attributable to the electricity supply industry. Future needs of capital are likely to be
heavy. In England and Wales the Electricity Council estimates that the consumption
of electricity will rise by an annual average of 7-5 per cent. Capital expenditure by the
industry over the eleven years 1956-67 is estimated at about £3,300 million, broadly
made up as follows: transmission and distribution, £1,400 million; construction of
power stations, £1,900 million.
The long-term capital of the electricity authorities is obtained from both internal
resources and borrowing. Under the Finance Act, 1956, as amended by that of 1958,
the authorities have power to raise money by means of Exchequer advances from the
Minister of Power and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Since 1956, issues of stock
have been suspended and the authorities have had recourse to Exchequer advances.
Total capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry in Great Britain from
the time of its nationalisation (in 1947) to 31st March, 1958 (in the case of the council)
and 31st December, 1957 (in the case of the boards) amounted to £1,922 million, of
which nearly one-third had been financed from internal resources, leaving £1,331
million to be raised by borrowing. The Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959,
authorised an increase in maximum borrowings from £1,675 million to £2,150 million
INDUSTRY 317
and the minister is authorised, under certain circumstances, to raise this ceiling to
£2,735 million.
In 1959-60 actual capital expenditure in England and Wales is estimated at £308-2
million, and expenditure approved for 1960-61 amounts to £275-4 million. In addition
the expenditure on nuclear fuel in 1959-60 amounted to £6-4 million and it is expected
that £9-6 million will be so spent in 1960-61.
Expenditure in 1959 by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board totalled £13
million and £14-7 million had been approved for i960; in 1959 by the South of Scotland
Electricity Board it amounted to £27-4 million and £26 million had been approved
for i960.
Research
The Electricity Council conducts research itself and helps to finance research
through its membership of the British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Asso¬
ciation, an organisation to which manufacturing firms and large consumers of electricity
also belong and which was established before the supply industry passed into public
ownership. This association is one of the autonomous research associations in receipt
of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Electricity
Council also has an Electricity Supply Research Council including independent experts
to advise it and the area boards, and can consult the Minister of Power’s Scientific
Advisory Council on problems affecting the supply and use of electricity. Direct
research on a laboratory scale is carried on by the Central Electricity Generating Board
at the Electricity Council’s laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey.
The Central Electricity Generating Board is establishing a new research centre, at
a cost of £1 million, adjacent to the Berkeley nuclear power station in Gloucestershire.
The centre will be used to investigate operational techniques and problems arising in
the running of nuclear power stations.
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority’s research into improved types
of nuclear power reactors includes work on fast breeder reactors at Dounreay, Caithness,
on advanced gas-cooled reactors at Windscale, Cumberland; and on high-temperature
gas-cooled reactors at Winfrith, Dorset.
Both Scottish electricity boards are empowered to carry out research and experi¬
mental work either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide range of research
and development work both independently and in conjunction with the British Electrical
and Allied Industries Research Association, colleges of science and technology, univer¬
sities and manufacturers. The South of Scotland Electricity Board has recently
extended its own research activities and is associated fully with those of the Electricity
Council and Central Electricity Generating Board in England.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry, gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by
a growing number of company and municipal undertakings. After the middle of
the century and the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1855, gas was used increasingly
as a source of heat for many purposes, such as domestic cooking and space and water
heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. In the last twenty years of the
century, however, gas for lighting purposes was subjected to increasing competition
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
318
from the new electricity supply industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandescent
mantle in 1887, which raised the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably, enabled
the industry to hold its own, while the use of gas for purposes other than lighting
increased.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the period
between the wars when increasing competition from electricity had to be met and
when changes in social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry under¬
took a large-scale programme of modernisation of production and distribution and
launched widespread sales promotion campaigns, especially for the numerous uses
of gas in the home. By 1939, the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
instead of lighting.
Organisation under Public Ownership
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry under public ownership and control
on 1st May, 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to local
authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. Together they cover the whole of
Great Britain and are charged with a statutory duty to develop and maintain an
efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply to domestic, industrial
and other consumers. The central body is the Gas Council, which is appointed by the
Minister of Power. It is a co-ordinating council, not a trading body, consisting of a
full-time chairman and deputy chairman and the 12 chairmen of the area boards.
Its general duties are to advise the minister on questions affecting the gas industry
and promote the efficient performance of their duties by the Area Boards. It has also
specific duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the other
publicly owned corporations, are charged with the responsibility of manufacturing
gas and distributing it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, which, like the
Gas Council, are appointed by the Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman
and deputy chairman, in some cases one or more full-time members, and usually
five or six part-time members, including the chairman of the Area Consultative Council.
There is no common pattern of organisation; each board is fully independent and has
devised its own subordinate structure. Each board is required to pay its way, taking
one year with another.
When the gas industry came under public ownership, a link between the industry
and the consuming public was established by the creation of a Consultative Council
in each board area. These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30
members, of whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons
nominated by the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland, the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a number
of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
Although the Gas Council is not a trading body, the operations of the area boards
have resulted, in the ten years up to 31st March, 1959, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately ^23 million before taxation.
Production
I959> in Great Britain, 22^ million tons of coal were carbonised by gas under¬
takings and 25^ million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry. Nearly
one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings for general
distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at collieries or steelworks.
INDUSTRY
3I9
In 1921, 250,300 million cubic feet of gas was manufactured by authorised gas
undertakings or acquired from coke ovens, and the number of consumers was 7-6
million. By 1959, gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens and other sources
for distribution had risen to 580,000 million cubic feet and the number of consumers
had risen to over 12-9 million, an increase of 130 per cent in the volume of gas available
and of about 70 per cent in the number of consumers.
In 1959, the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was 7,042 million cubic
feet, most of it for household use.
The total number of persons employed in the gas industry in Great Britain in
1959 was about 130,000.
Consumption
Half of all gas produced is sold for household use and the remainder for industrial
and commercial purposes.
Domestic Use. While an accurate statistical analysis of the domestic load is not
possible, evidence given before the Ridley Committee (on Fuel and Power Policy),
appointed by the then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1951, suggested that about
70 per cent of the domestic load was used for cooking, the remaining 30 per cent
being spread over space heating, water heating and other installations. Most homes
in Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to
difficulties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic. These difficulties have
been overcome to some extent by the use of local high-pressure storage tanks but
this development is unlikely to grow, owing to the steady extension of rural electricity
supplies. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which require
the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery
industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In
1959, industrial consumption of gas totalled 170,000 million cubic feet.
Coke and By-products
Production of coke at gas works in 1959 was io-i million tons, and at coke ovens
17-9 million tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce about 3 million
tons of crude coal tar and 108 million gallons of crude benzole a year. These products,
together with those of the phenolic and basic types and sulphur, yield derivatives
which include dyestuffs (of which Britain now produces most of its own requirements),
fertilisers, plastics, germicides (the sulphonamides and sulphanilamides), insecticides,
refrigerants, perfumes, and synthetic yarns.
With further research and development, more especially m the field oi organic
chemistry, the production of coal carbonisation derivatives is of great importance
to the industry.
Capital Investment
The chief object of capital expenditure in the years immediately after the war was
to overtake arrears of plant renewal. Recent plans for expansion are outlined in the
Gas Council’s publication Gas Looks Ahead. j
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas Boar s
was limited to £250 million. The Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1954,
extended these borrowing powers to £45° million.
The industry in recent years has been spending about £50 million a year on capital
320
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
investment. Between vesting day (ist May, 1949) and March i960, £510 million had
been invested in fixed assets. Expenditure of £53 million has been approved for 1960-61.
The Gas Act, i960, increases the limit to ^500 million or up to £525 million if
authorised by Order in Council in the period up to 31st March, 1966.
Development and Research
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable integration
by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas (through gas grids and long¬
distance mains), enabling production to be concentrated in the most efficient units.
Progress is also being made in interconnections for the reception of gas from coke
ovens, notably in Wales, Durham and Yorkshire.
The industry is investigating processes of gasifying coal of inferior quality. At
Westfield, in Fife, Scotland, a gas plant, costing £6-6 million, and using low-grade
coal, was expected to be in production by the end of i960 and, when completed in
1962, will be producing 30 million cubic feet of gas a day, about one-fifth of the total
gas requirements of Scotland. The plant marks a change within the industry from
conventional carbonisation of coal to the use of chemical processes. Because the gas
will be made at high pressure, it will be possible to pipe it through a 133-mile grid-
main covering industrial Scotland. Further advantages of this method are low costs
and the production of by-products such as tar, ammonia and benzole. Provision
has been made for the erection of a similar plant by the West Midlands Gas Board
at Coleshill, near Birmingham.
Alternative sources of gas are being developed by the Gas Council. Gases from oil
refineries (butane or propane) are used in several installations in smaller towns remote
from large gas works or the grid systems. Progress has also been made with the use
of methane, drained from coal mines, and the purchase of surplus gases from
oil refineries.
A number of oil gasification plants have been built. These include a plant constructed
by the South Eastern Gas Board adjacent to the British Petroleum Company’s refinery
at Isle of Grain, Kent, to convert petroleum products to gas of acceptable quality.
This installation, which began operating in 1958, converts some 50,000 tons of
petroleum products a year and has a daily output of 18 million cubic feet of gas.
The world’s first shipload of liquid natural gas arrived at Canvey Island, Essex,
from the United States Gulf Coast, in February 1959 in a specially converted 3,000-
ton cargo ship, the Methane Pioneer, owned jointly by the Gas Council and an American
concern. A number of further shipments have been made.
The Gas Council’s research organisation consists of a research committee which
advises on research policy, two research stations, one in London and one at Solihull,
and the Watson House Centre at Fulham, London, for the design, testing and develop¬
ment of appliances. Research is also carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds
University and at other universities and colleges. The main object of the council’s
research is the development of new processes making use of poorer quality coals and of
alternative primary fuels.
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The Government has for a number of years sought to promote efficiency in the use
of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, and has been assisted by various
bodies representative of producers and consumers.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National Coal Board,
coal distributors and coal appliance manufacturers. It was originally formed in 1932
INDUSTRY
321
to give information and advice on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice
of installation and the operation of solid fuel appliances, to domestic users and to
retailers.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service,
which was formed to promote fuel saving in industry, came into operation in May
1954. It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of
forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale heat and power surveys and regular visits
on a contract basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, in general, sufficient for domestic and industrial
requirements. The sources of water, however, are often distant from the areas where
supplies are needed, and water undertakings are therefore mainly concerned with
abstraction, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from
surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering
grounds and river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells,
adits and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity
and gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings of
different kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the
Minister of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the Secretary
of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Minister of Health and Local Government
in Northern Ireland.
Development of Water Supply in England and Wales
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies became
a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy. It was largely
due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who demonstrated the dangers
arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation, that the Public Health Act, 1848,
became law in England and Wales and laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing
with public health.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of separate large
water undertakings were set up to provide adequate supplies of pure water to the
expanding urban population, and the water supply system developed rapidly, although
in piecemeal fashion and with some overlapping and waste.
Organisation of Water Supply in England and Wales
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water supplies
are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this either by operating
a water undertaking themselves or by ensuring that other bodies are providing an
adequate supply. The householder receives his domestic water supply at a com¬
paratively small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of
a water rate levied, like other rates, on the value of his house.
By the Water Act, 1945, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has a
duty to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in England and
Wales. The same Act provided for a statutory Central Advisory Water Committee
(replacing the previous non-statutory committee) to advise the minister on general
questions relating to water and to deal with the local organisation of water supplies
and the powers and duties of local authorities and other water concerns. Local
authorities were required, in extension of the duties placed on them under the Public
322
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Health Acts, to secure piped wholesome water in every part of their districts where there
were houses or schools, unless it was impracticable to do so at reasonable cost.
In the years between the passing of the Water Act and i960, 404 smaller water
authorities in England and Wales were absorbed by larger authorities or by the
creation of joint boards. The principal object of such amalgamation is the constitution
of more efficient units in the water supply industry, and efforts to reduce the number
of separate undertakings have recently been intensified.
In March i960, there were, in England and Wales, 685 local authority water under¬
takings, 73 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and 10 joint water
committees, 61 statutory water companies, 14 non-statutory water companies, and 3
private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable number of private proprietors
without statutory powers also provide small supplies. Water undertakings vary greatly
in size; about half the population is served by the 48 largest undertakings, and the
other half by over 790 smaller ones.
The Metropolitan Water Board, which is probably the largest single water under¬
taking in the world, supplies about 340 million gallons daily to about 6-5 million
people in the London area. The board was established in 1903, and in the following
year took over the undertakings of eight water companies which were supplying the
London area. It now consists of 88 part-time members who are the elected representa¬
tives of the various local authorities within the board’s area of operations, together
with one representative each from the Thames and Lee Conservancies. The chairman
and vice-chairman are chosen by members of the board.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
Today, piped water reaches over 95 per cent of the total population of England
and Wales and about 90 per cent of the rural population.
Between £40 and £50 million a year is spent on capital investment, financed mainly
by loans, the interest on which, together with running costs, is paid by the water
undertakings from annual income. This income is derived from local water rates levied
on domestic consumers and from charges for supplies as recorded by meter in the case
of most industrial users. In addition to supplies from water undertakings, large
quantities of water are taken by industry from rivers or underground sources.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934, and under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955. By March i960, schemes costing £80 million had
been completed or were in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water and some diminution in supplies in so far as such growth involves covering
the ground with impervious material, so that water which previously would have
percolated through to underground natural reservoirs is now carried off in drains
and rivers. On the other hand, improved methods of purification in recent years
have resulted in greater use being made of wrater drawn from the lower reaches of
rivers. In 1955, a sub-committee was set up by the Central Advisory Water Com¬
mittee to study the growing demand for water and the problems involved in meeting
it. In its first report, The Growing Demand for Water, published in 1959, the sub¬
committee stated that in spite of an expected 23 per cent increase in consumption of
water in the ten years ending 1965, development schemes prepared by the public
water suppliers should enable them amply to meet likely demands. After 1965, the
country’s rainfall would be sufficient to ensure an adequate supply of water to meet
growing needs, provided that the proper means of conservation and distribution were
INDUSTRY
323
developed. The danger of serious depletion of the natural flow of many rivers and
streams by abstraction of water for such purposes as irrigation was the subject of the
sub-committee’s second report, published in June i960, and a recommendation was
made that private abstractions should be controlled.
Water Supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland
In Scotland, public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local authorities,
either separately or in combination with each other; they supply over 95 per cent
of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in
England and Wales save that less reliance needs to be placed on underground sources.
Scotland has separate legislation. The Water (Scotland) Acts, 1946 and 1949, among
other provisions, impose a general duty on the Secretary of State to promote the con¬
servation of water resources in Scotland; require local authorities to provide supplies
of wholesome water everywhere in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable
cost; and provide for a uniform system of rating for water throughout the country.
The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts, 1944 to 1955, make available to Scottish
local authorities grant assistance up to a maximum of £30 million towards the cost of
water supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas. By December 1959, the total
value of work done on new and improved water supplies since 1945 amounted to
£49-3 million, of which £23-6 million represents works aided by grants under
these Acts.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water. The Water Supplies and Sewerage
Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, in addition to making provision for the payment of
Government grants to all water supply authorities, places upon them statutory obliga¬
tions with regard to the supply of water to houses and schools. Since 1945, a piped
water supply has been, or is being, provided for every town, and in rural areas piped
water supplies are being extended. Progress has been very rapid, and by 31st March,
i960, £24-8 million had been expended, including grants totalling j£io-6 million.
Measurement of Water Resources
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface water
resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, published
annually by H.M. Stationery Office. This publication contains particulars of the run¬
off and related rainfall from a large number of rivers, streams and reservoired areas.
The Surface Water Survey Centre of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government
is responsible for the promotion of gauging, the collection of hydrological information,
and the publication of the year book. The field work of surface water measurement is
carried out by river boards, water undertakings and other bodies. General information
on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the responsibility of the
Meteorological Office, while the subject of ground water is dealt with by the Geological
Survey and Museum. In special cases the Hydraulics Research Station of the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research carries out research into problems of the
design and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of surface
water. A close liaison is maintained between these organisations.
A report by a sub-committee of the Central Advisory Water Committee, Information
on Water Resources, published in 1959, proposed that steps should be taken to review
current research work and to determine how such work should be co-ordinated. The
sub-committee recommended certain extensions of existing facilities for recording
rainfall, snowfall and underground water and for measuring river flows.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Water Pollution
It is an offence for any person to permit any polluting matter, solid or liquid, to
enter a river. The Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951, revised and strengthened
previous legislation for the prevention of river pollution in England and Wales.
Enforcement of the Act is vested in the river boards (see p. 288), the Thames and Lee
conservators, and, in London and adjacent areas, in the councils of the metropolitan
boroughs, counties, and county boroughs concerned. There is a similar Act for
Scotland under which nine river purification boards have been set up to promote
the cleanliness of the rivers in their areas.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research is engaged in investigating problems connected with the treat¬
ment of water for domestic and industrial supply, the treatment and disposal of
sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention of pollution of
surface water and underground water. The laboratory maintains close contact with
other interested Government departments, with municipal and other public authorities
and with industry. Research is carried out with general supervision and advice from
the Water Pollution Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research. The board was set up in 1927 and its members are appointed by the Lord
President of the Council.
The Standing Technical Committee on Synthetic Detergents (appointed by the
Minister of Housing and Local Government after consultation with the Secretary
of State for Scotland) issued its third progress report in April i960. The report gives
an account of a large-scale experiment being carried out in Luton with the help of
manufacturers of synthetic detergents. An alternative material, more readily decom¬
posed in treatment of sewage than the material now in general use, has been incorporated
in most of the synthetic detergents on sale there. It is tentatively concluded from the
experiment that general use of the alternative material would reduce substantially
the difficulties of water pollution associated with synthetic detergents. Further research
is being undertaken.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industries are concerned primarily with the construction and
repair of houses, hospitals, schools, offices, shops and factories, and with civil engineer¬
ing works such as bridges, docks, harbours, railways, roads, airports, power stations,
hydro-electric schemes, irrigation systems, and atomic energy establishments. The
industries employ some 1^ million persons (including about 70,000 women) and provide
over 6 per cent of the gross domestic output of goods and services. They also make an
important contribution to overseas development.
Structure
Over four-fifths of all constructional work is done by private concerns. The majority
of firms are small or medium sized. Nearly 30 per cent of the firms in the industry are
one-man businesses engaged in such trades as house painting or plumbing, and over
60 per cent employ fewer than nineteen persons. At the other end of the scale there
are fewer than a dozen firms of building and civil engineering contractors employing
more than 5,000 persons each on the permanent staff. Some of these are integrated
concerns owning quarries as well as workshops, extensive stocks of mechanical plant,
and the standard stores and tackle of builders’ yards; they also undertake large-

scale constructional contracts overseas. Some firms are prepared to offer a ‘package’
service comprising complete responsibility for projects from design to finished
building.
There are also about 200 United Kingdom firms of consulting engineers which
undertake detailed investigations of constructional projects, report on the type of
work recommended and materials required, provide estimates of the time and cost of
construction, obtain competitive tenders from contracting firms and supervise the
carrying out of the work by the contractor. In addition, there are hundreds of firms of
architects and quantity surveyors which are concerned with the design, planning and
costing of building and civil engineering projects.
A growing proportion of construction work, in Britain and overseas, is being under¬
taken by ‘consortia’, i.e. organisations in which several firms group together to secure
large contracts—such as the building of nuclear power stations—which are beyond
the technical or financial resources of a single firm. One example is the consortium
of 13 firms engaged in manufacture or construction set up to build a steelworks at
Durgapur, India, which will have an annual capacity of million tons.
Value of Output
The value of the annual output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily since
1945, and the total for Great Britain in 1959 is estimated to amount to £2,394 million.
Of this total £418 million represents work carried out by the staffs employed directly
by the public authorities (including Government departments, local authorities and
certain public utilities), while the balance of £1,976 million represents the output
of private firms (new work, £1,514 million, and other work, £462 million).
Housing Construction
In the post-war period most new houses in Britain have been built by private
firms working under contract to local authorities, but the proportion built by private
firms for private owners has increased appreciably since 1951. About 15 per cent of
local authorities employ direct labour in housing construction, while about 70 per
cent use their own labour for repair and maintenance. In 1959, the value of new
housing built in Great Britain by private firms was £568 million, of which £245
million was for private owners and £323 million for public authorities.
Between 1945 and the end of 1959, some 3,470,000 new permanent houses and other
dwellings were built in the United Kingdom (including over 80,000 in Northern
Ireland), besides some 160,000 temporary houses constructed in the immediate
post-war years with extensive use of prefabrication techniques.
Civil Engineering and Industrial Building
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale modern
industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment to carry out
major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent figures in the
early development of civil engineering included: James Brindley (1716-1772), builder
of canals; John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), pioneer in road construction; Thomas
Telford (1757-1834), builder of roads, docks and bridges; and George Stephenson
(1781-1848), Robert Stephenson (1803-1859), Joseph Locke (1805-1860), Isambard
Kingdom Brunei (1806-1859) and Thomas Brassey (1805-1870), builders of railways.
Within the United Kingdom the industry has been occupied since the war with
large-scale reconstruction and development schemes. These have included work

326
on the repair, modernisation and electrification of railways, road and dock develop¬
ment schemes, airports, sea defence works, thermo-electric and hydro-electric power
stations, improved water supplies, and drainage and sewerage systems.
Among the important civil engineering projects under construction in the United
Kingdom in i960 were: the Whiteinch Funnel, under the river Clyde at Glasgow,
the Dartford-Purfleet Tunnel under the Thames; the road bridge over the Firth of
Forth; a 5 million ton capacity oil refinery at Milford Haven and large steelworks in
Wales’and Scotland. Some £75 million will be spent in 1960-61 on new motorways
and road reorganisation (see pp. 374~5)- Investment programmes of the nationalised
industries in coal, hydro-electric development, nuclear power stations and rail transport
also involve constructional work on a large scale.
In Great Britain since the war, more than 20,000 industrial buildings of over 5,000
sq. ft. (with a total area of almost 447 million sq. ft.) and many smaller factories have
been erected.
Output in Northern Ireland
Developments in the building and civil engineering industries in Northern Ireland
have followed much the same pattern as in Great Britain.
The output of these industries has been relatively higher in Northern Ireland
since 1946 than before the war, as considerable leeway had to be made up. Progress
has been particularly marked in housing, hospitals and schools, water supply and
sewTerage, road reconstruction schemes, arterial drainage and harbour schemes. An
extensive programme of factory construction has been under way since 1947 with the
object of attracting new industries to Northern Ireland.
Overseas Constructional Work
Constructional work carried out overseas by British firms has included railways
in most parts of the world; large-scale irrigation works in India, Pakistan, Egypt
and Greece; and canals, roads, docks, harbours, power stations, airfields, hydro¬
electric schemes and industrial and housing estates in several countries. British
conditions of contract for international civil engineering work have been widely adopted
as standard throughout the world.
Examples of large contracts in recent years include: hydro-electric schemes at
Owen Falls (Uganda), and Hirfanli (Turkey); dock extensions at Calcutta and Bombay
(India); harbour works at Takoradi and Tema (Ghana), and Aden (one of the largest
bunkering stations for oil in the world); a new port at Salaverry (Peru); thermal
power stations at Pretoria and Johannesburg (South Africa); a geothermal pow'er
station at Wairakei (New Zealand); dry docks at Karachi (Pakistan); houses, airfields,
roads and bridges, and the drilling of oil wells to the value of £25 million in Iraq;
modernisation of the trunk road system, the construction of a natural gas pipeline
and the building of a fertiliser factory in Iran; industrial estate development in
Annacis Island (Canada); 12-storey office blocks in Toronto (Canada); irrigation
schemes for sugar and citrus estates in Southern Rhodesia; an oil refinery at Rio de
Janeiro (Brazil); a pharmaceutical products factory in Iran; the Auckland harbour
bridge (New Zealand), opened in May 1959; the Adomi bridge across the river Volta
(Ghana); a mile-long road bridge costing million over the river Niger, and the
construction of a breakwater costing £8 million (Nigeria).
It has been estimated that the value of work done during the year ended March
i960 by some 67 principal British building and civil engineering firms, operating
in some 70 countries, was nearly ^124 million, compared with ^120 million in the
INDUSTRY
327
previous year; and the value of contracts obtained rose from £115 million in 1958-59
to £131 million in 1959-60. Most of the work done was in the sterling area, although
about 30 per cent was in the dollar area.
Among the major projects on which British consulting engineers have been engaged
in recent years are the hydro-electric scheme at Kariba and the power development,
irrigation and flood control project in Shire Valley (both in the Federation of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland), the Kai Tak airport at Hong Kong, and the trans-Iranian pipeline
survey.
In 1959, Britain exported prefabricated buildings to the value of £3-8 million.
Research and Development
The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) set up the Building
Research Station in 1921, and thus made Britain the pioneer of organised building
research. Work affecting the construction industries is also carried on in other research
laboratories connected with the DSIR, including the National Physical Laboratory, the
Road Research Laboratory, the Forest Products Research Laboratory, the Geological
Survey and Museum, the Water Pollution Research Laboratory, the Fire Research
Station and the Hydraulics Research Station. Other bodies concerned with such research
include the Admiralty, universities and colleges of technology, trade associations and
individual firms.
The largest building firms’ practice of maintaining their own research and develop¬
ment groups has developed chiefly during the past decade. These groups are mainly
concerned with the control of site operations and the development of particular
systems of production. Advances in the design and construction of special types of
building have been made by specialised development groups such as the Ministry
of Education’s development group on schools. Such groups work in close collaboration
with the Building Research Station.
An example of fruitful collaboration is the research on concrete manufacture
conducted over more than twenty years by the Building Research Station and the
Road Research Laboratory in conjunction with United Kingdom universities and the
Cement and Concrete Association.
Some major advances in technology and materials have been made in recent years,
for example, in the mechanisation of earth excavating and site clearance, in the develop¬
ment of mobile hoists, in road-making techniques, in methods of welding, in concrete
mixing and by the introduction of unit construction processes for bridge building.
New materials and new techniques, including prefabrication, are being developed and
applied in the construction of schools, hospitals, factories, offices and shops, as well
as in the building of permanent houses. ... . . .
The principal professional body in the civil engineering industry is the Institution
of Civil Engineers, incorporated by Royal Charter in 1828.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The United Kingdom’s manufacturing industries provide an exceedingly wide
range of products, many of which play a major role in world trade. In terms of net
output and exports the most important groups of industries are those concerned
with the manufacture of metals and metal products, though the textile and chemical
industries are also of considerable significance. Some impression of the relative
importance of the different groups in terms of the value of net output is given in

The pattern of manufacturing industry has changed markedly in response to
technological progress, new demands from home and export markets and the intro¬
duction of new and improved materials. The rate of expansion has been especially
rapid in electronics and in most sections of electrical engineering, in almost all branches
of the chemical industry and in the aircraft and motor vehicle industries.
Expansion has been particularly marked in those industries which are in a position
to make use of automation equipment, for example, transfer machines, the linking
of machine tools in automatic production lines, the use of electronic control equip¬
ment and electronic data-processing machines. In several industries, such as oil refining,
steelmaking, motor vehicles, electronic components and chemicals, automation has
been introduced on a wide scale.
METAL MANUFACTURE
The metal manufacturing industries employed nearly 600,000 persons at the
end of 1959. Nearly three-quarters of these were engaged in the iron and steel industry,
including iron founding.
Iron and Steel
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the seven¬
teenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the series of
discoveries which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half of the
nineteenth century. Today, Britain is one of the world’s four largest producers of
steel. Production of crude steel, which in 1946 totalled 12-7 million ingot tons, rose to
21*7 million ingot tons in 1957, falling back to 19-3 million ingot tons in 1958 and to
INDUSTRY
329
-20-2 million ingot tons in 1959; capacity is available to produce about 25-5 million ingot
tons. Pig iron production rose from 7-8 million tons in 1946 to 14-3 million tons in
1957; output in 1959 was 12-6 million tons. In 1959, direct exports of steel amounted
to 3-7 million ingot tons valued at ^172 million, in addition to indirect exports, esti¬
mated in 1959 to amount to the equivalent of 4-1 million ingot tons, in the form of
sales by the steel-consuming industries; exports of the machinery industry (other
than electrical machinery), and of the shipbuilding and vehicle industries, which are
major consumers of steel, were valued at over £1,000 million in 1959.
South Wales and the north-east coast of England are the United Kingdom’s two
largest steel-producing areas, together responsible for an annual crude steel production
•of nearly 8-4 million ingot tons, or more than 40 per cent of the total output. South
Wales is engaged mainly in the production of flat products, and is especially noted for
tinplate. In the north-east coastal area of England, production is concentrated on
heavy sections and rails, and plates for the shipbuilding and other industries. Scotland,
with an annual production of over 2 million ingot tons, finds its chief internal markets
in the shipbuilding and engineering industries of the Clyde valley. Sheffield is known
throughout the world for its special alloy steels. Two other areas with a substantial
share of output are north Lincolnshire and Lancashire. Britain possesses some of the
most up-to-date steel plants in Europe; for example, the £18 million universal beam
mill near Middlesbrough, in the north-east of Yorkshire, for the production of structural
steel, which came into operation in 1958, the steelworks at Ravenscraig near Motherwell,
Scotland, completed in 1957 at a cost of £22-5 million, and the integrated strip mill
at Margam in South Wales.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932, when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory Com¬
mittee, gave special attention to the reorganisation of the industry. In February 1951,
the greater part of the industry came under public ownership by virtue of the Iron and
Steel Act, 1949. The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which
established an Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency with the duty of return¬
ing the companies, which had continued to operate as separate units, to private owner¬
ship. By March i960, there remained 11 companies, of which two are major companies,
in which the agency had direct holdings.
The 1953 Act also provided for the establishment of the Iron and Steel Board to
exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry. The board is responsible
to the Minister of Power and includes, in addition to the chairman and one other full¬
time member, a number of part-time members drawn from steel producers, steel
consumers and trade unions. The major trade association in the iron and steel industry,
excluding iron founding, is the British Iron and Steel Federation.
It is estimated that by 1962, over £1,000 million will have been spent on develop¬
ment and modernisation since 1945- Expenditure in 1959 was about £100 million and a
substantial increase was expected in i960. Crude steel capacity by 1962 should approach
29 million tons. The growing demand for flat-rolled products is being provided for by
the construction of two new wide-strip mills in Wales and Scotland, and it is estimated
that these, together with extensions to existing mills, will raise production to 4-9
million tons of sheet and tinplate by 1962, rising to 6-i million tons by 1965. The
industry plans to increase its consumption of home-produced ore from nearly 15
million tons in 1959 to 21 million tons by 1962, and that of foreign ores from nearly
13 million tons (in 1957, nearly 16 million tons) to between 21 and 23 million tons.
The industry’s long-term programme provides for a fleet of 72 special ore carriers,
50 were in service at the end of 1959*

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some 300,000 people were employed in 1959 in iron and steel manufacture (exclud¬
ing iron foundries). Of these, about 150,000 are process workers and 100,000 general
and maintenance workers.
Notable recent developments in steelmaking include the increasing use of oxygen,
not only in its application to conventional steelmaking processes, but also in the
pneumatic processes. The relatively new process of continuously casting steel, which
removes the necessity for the primary rolling plant, is to be installed on a commercial
basis by several firms.
Iron Founding
Iron castings are required by most branches of the engineering industry, and
especially in the manufacture of motor vehicles, tractors, machine tools and power
units of all kinds; they are also used by the steel industry. There are some 1,500
firms in the industry, ranging from small units to foundries employing over 1,500
people. About 128,000 people were employed at the end of 1959. Iron foundries are
found in all parts of the United Kingdom, but there is some concentration in the
Midlands and other engineering centres.
Output of iron in castings fell back to 3-5 million tons in 1959 (compared with
3-93 million tons in the peak year of 1955), as a result of a reduced demand in some
trades. Over one million tons are used annually in the general engineering industry,
nearly 700,000 tons in the motor vehicle industry and 400,000 tons in the steel industry;
about 550,000 tons are required by the building industry.
Non-ferrous Metals
The non-ferrous metals industry in Britain, employing some 128,000 persons,
is the largest in Europe and in 1958 contributed over £142 million to the net
national output.
Nowadays the mining in Britain of non-ferrous ores is confined to the working
of lead, tin and tungsten ores on a small scale. However, the United Kingdom is a
large consumer of non-ferrous metals, being second only to the United States among
Western countries in its consumption of aluminium, copper, lead, tin and zinc.
Production in 1959 included the following: aluminium, 25,000 tons of virgin metal
and 107,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 96,000 tons of virgin copper
and 97,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 89,000 tons of refined metal; zinc, 73,000
tons of slab metal; and tin, 28,000 tons. In almost every case, output in 1959 was well
below the peak level of previous years.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include South
Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. It consists mainly of factories for smelting,
casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing of the metals mentioned
above, and of nickel and magnesium. The techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure
diecasting are also employed where appropriate. Some of the non-ferrous metals such
as nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium are largely used in the making of high
speed and tool steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have
emerged with the growth of new industries having their own particular requirements,
as, for example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium, beryllium),
jet aircraft (niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium,
silicon, germanium, tantalum), and the United Kingdom industry has some of the
most advanced plants in the world for the preparation of zirconium and beryllium.
In 1959, direct exports of non-ferrous base metals (including semi-fabricated
products) were valued at £113 million, of which copper and its alloys accounted for
INDUSTRY
331
^50 million, aluminium and its alloys for £16 million, nickel for £16 million and tin
for £25 million. The United States (£23-5 million) and Western Germany (£14-2
million) were easily the largest purchasing countries. In addition there were further
substantial exports of finished products incorporating non-ferrous semi-manufactures
and of non-ferrous metals in many fabricated forms.
SHIPBUILDING, SHIP REPAIRING AND MARINE ENGINEERING
Britain has for centuries been one of the most important shipbuilding countries.
Modern shipbuilding dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
iron-clad steam-driven vessel replaced the earlier sailing ship. Britain led the way
in the substitution of steel for iron and in the development of the steam turbine.
Between 1890 and 1913 Britain produced more than half the world’s new tonnage,
and in 1920 launched over two million tons, still the peace-time record for the industry.
In the inter-war years the problem of surplus capacity, common to all shipbuilding
countries, caused a substantial fall in activity and periodic heavy unemployment.
During the second world war the industry was fully occupied in building and repairing
warships and merchant ships and a high level of activity in the building and repair of
merchant ships has been maintained since 1945. At the end of June i960, 1-9 million
gross tons were under construction.
Well over three-quarters of the tonnage of ships built in the United Kingdom
comes from four areas: on the river Clyde in Scotland (where the Queen Mary and
Queen Elizabeth, the world’s largest ships, were built in the inter-war years; on the
north-east coast of England—along the lower reaches of the rivers Tyne, Wear and
Tees, and at West Hartlepool, and Blyth; on the north-west coast of England—on
the river Mersey, and at Barrow-in-Furness, where the Oriana was launched in
November 1959; and at Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where the largest individual
shipyard is situated.
In each of these areas there is capacity for building warships and all types of merchant
ships from large passenger liners and tankers to small sea-going ships such as coasters
and cross-Channel steamers. Ships are also built in the Southampton area, in the
Isle of Wight, and along the estuaries of the rivers Forth and Tay, in Scotland, while
numerous places along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts, harbour craft and barges.
Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the great ports. The majority of the
fourteen largest firms engaged in repair work also carry on shipbuilding work, and
about one-quarter of ship repairing activity is concentrated on the north-east coast
of England. The recession in shipping in 1958 and 1959 led to reduced activity in
ship repairing, and the numbers employed fell to about 64,000 by February 1959-
In 1959, there were about 205,000 persons employed in the shipbuilding and ship
repairing industries, including those employed in naval dockyards, and about 82,000
in marine engineering.
Between 1945 and 1959, British shipyards launched over 18 million gross tons oi
shipping, including more than 4 million gross tons for foreign owners.
Output had been held back on account of shortages of steel, skilled labour and
components, and launchings in i959> at approximately 1-4 million gross tons, did
not represent the industry’s full capacity. Of the ships launched in i959> 39 Per
cent were oil tankers. The value of exports of ships and boats in 1959 totalled ^48 million.
Over the past twenty years, traditional methods of shipbuilding have undergone
radical changes, primarily due to advances in welding technique. These ha\e led
to the production of ships in large units, 50 to 60 tons in weight, prefabricated under
cover and rapidly assembled for launching. The industry is spending large sums on
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
332
the modernisation and mechanisation of shipyards: £50 million was invested in the
period 1946-57 and it is planned to spend about £70 million in the following five years,,
including the construction of berths for the building of tankers of up to 100,000 gross
tons. In 1959 and i960, United Kingdom shipyards launched several liners of more
than 20,000 gross tons, including the 46,000 gross ton Canberra (built at Belfast),
the largest liner to be built in Britain since the Queen Elizabeth, launched in 1939.
The British Shipbuilding Research Association (BSRA) is engaged in all aspects
of shipbuilding research, and the Parsons and Marine Engineering Turbine Research
and Development Association (Pametrada) are developing gas turbines and improving
the efficiency of diesel and steam units. The Government has invited tenders for
two types of nuclear reactor suitable for installation in a tanker of 65,000 d.w.t.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Mechanical engineering comprises a very wide range of industries, including agri¬
cultural machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools and gauges, industrial
engines, textile machinery and accessories, office machinery, refrigerating machinery,
industrial plant and steel work, ordnance and small arms, construction plant and
quarrying machinery, mechanical handling equipment, scientific, surgical and photo¬
graphic instruments, and watches and clocks. The total number of persons employed
in mechanical engineering in 1959 was about 1,200,000, and the value of exports
exceeded £625 million.
Agricultural Machinery and Tractors
The agricultural machinery industry employs about 37,000 people and in 1959.
its annual output, including both machinery and tractors, was valued at the record
level of ^163 million, of which over half was accounted for by tractors. Britain has
some of the most up-to-date tractor manufacturing plants in the world, and three of
the five largest manufacturers are also makers of motor vehicles. In i959> production
of tractors, almost all of which were diesel-powered, totalled 216,000 and exports
amounted to 116,000. The United Kingdom exported more tractors in that year than
the rest of the world together.
Agricultural machinery and implements are manufactured in several areas, with
some concentration in Lincolnshire, East Anglia, and the north of England. In 1959,
4,400 combine harvesters and 23,800 mouldboard ploughs were produced, while the
output of pick-up balers totalled 13,940, an increase of 75 per cent over 1957-
Exports of agricultural machinery and tractors in 1959 totalled £103 million a
record; of this total, ^65-5 million was accounted for by tractors, ^21-1 million by
tractor parts and £15-9 million by machinery and implements. The largest markets
for British tractors are the Scandinavian countries, North America, Australia and
South Africa.
Metal-working Machine Tools
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the early
1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and screw cutting lathe,
as well as other machine tools. The industry’s output today ranges from watchmakers’
lathes weighing a few pounds to transfer lines for motor vehicle manufacture and
electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one ten-thousandth
part of an inch.
There are some 350 separate firms making machine tools, but the greater part of
the industry’s output comes from about 150 firms. The high degree of specialisation
INDUSTRY
333
makes it possible for the small firm to flourish. About 42,000 workers are employed.
The industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, and to
a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. The Machine Tool Trades Association
of Great Britain is the representative body of most of the machine tool manufacturers
and importers and is responsible for the International Machine Tool Exhibitions
held in Britain every four years; the most recent exhibition took place in i960.
The value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose from £6-5 million
in 1935 to £95 million in 1957, falling back to ^79 million in 1959, owing to recession
in home and export markets in the previous two years. Deliveries for export in 1959
amounted to j£i8-6 million, while orders on hand at the end of 1959 totalled nearly
£56 million, of which nearly 30 per cent was for export. A substantial expansion in
total output and in exports is expected in i960.
Substantial expenditures on plant and buildings have been made in recent years;
it is estimated that the value of the capital employed in the industry trebled between
1948 and 1957, and by i960 will amount to some £93 million.
Industrial Engines
United Kingdom manufacturers have a world-wide reputation for small marine
and industrial internal combustion engines, in particular for lightweight diesel engines.
The value of deliveries of industrial engines, including small marine engines, rose
from £27 million in 1948 to the record level of about £56 million in 1959, including
about £20 million for direct export. In addition, indirect exports accounted for a
further £9 million. The number of engines delivered in 1959 was 372,000. Production
of parts and accessories accounted for a further ^16 million.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry, which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. The industry
now gives employment to about 53,000 people and comprises about 450 firms, situated
mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Dundee, Leicester and Nottingham,
making a wide range of machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing
of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres, including bast and
leaf fibre machinery of which the United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest
supplier.
The industry enjoys a world-wide reputation, not only for the high quality of
its products but also because its offers a complete and modern range of equipment
consisting of: spinning machinery, including machinery for all the preparatory
processes; winding machinery and machinery for other processes prior to weaving;
weaving machinery; knitting, hosiery and lace machinery; printing, dyeing and
other finishing machinery; and all types of mill stores and textile machinery accessories.
In 1959, deliveries (including accessories) totalled ^72 million. Exports were valued
at £41 million, with India, the USSR, Australia and Western Germany as the largest
markets.
Construction Equipment and Quarrying Machinery
Production of construction equipment in the United Kingdom before the second
world war was mainly concerned with small excavators, concrete mixing machinery and
road surfacing plant, including road rollers. But today many new machines, expeciall^
machinery for earth-moving, are in production; examples are crawler tractors, motor

.334
graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers and rooters. About
24,000 people are employed in the industry.
Whereas output in 1935 was valued at only £2 million, in 1959 it reached nearly
£91 million, of which about half was for export. The most important items were
earth-moving machinery, about 30 per cent of the total value, and excavators and
parts (about one-quarter of the total). Excavators are the largest single export product
by value.
Office Machinery
The United Kingdom office machinery industry is now second in size only to
that of the United States, and since 1946 has expanded at a remarkable rate. In 1959,
the value of deliveries of office machinery (such as accounting machinery, punched-
card machinery and some types of electronic computers, typewriters, dictating machines,
and duplicating and copying machinery) was £60 million, of which £2^ million
worth was exported, including £3-3 million worth to Canadian and United States
markets: over half of the value of output is from accounting and similar machinery.
Output of portable typewriters, which has increased by 40 per cent since I955> an<^
of standard machines are at about the same level, 130,000 and 145,000 respectively
in 1959; more than half the typewriters manufactured are for overseas, and exports
in 1959 were valued at about £3-2 million. British subsidiaries or associates of United
States firms are prominent in the office machinery industry.
Refrigeration Machinery
The United Kingdom industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances,
extending from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial
use to industrial refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals
and other products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships. Production
of commercial and industrial refrigeration machinery was well established before
the second world war, but the present large production of domestic refrigerators has
been built up since 1946.
The value of deliveries of refrigeration machinery in 1959 totalled over £59 million,
an increase of about one-third above the previous year’s figure; more than half con¬
sisted of domestic refrigerators which numbered 934,000, against only 360,000 in
1957. Export deliveries were valued at £i2-(i million, and represented about one-fifth
of the output.
Industrial Valves
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital component
in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil and electric power
industries. About 90 per cent of the United Kingdom production is made by 63
firms, mainly situated in the Midlands, Glasgow and the north of England; some 15,000
persons are employed in this branch of the engineering industry. The value of deliveries
in 1959 was estimated at about £35 million.
Exports more than doubled between 1949 and 1959, when they were valued at
;£ii-3 million. The United Kingdom ranks third to the United States and Western
Germany in world exports of industrial valves, and accounts for about one-fifth
of the total.
Boilers and Boilerhouse Plant
Boilers and boilerhouse plant manufactured in the United Kingdom have many
industrial applications. Water tube boilers of advanced design and large steam-raising
INDUSTRY
335
capacity are produced by the industry for home power stations and for export. Firms
in the industry are members of the groups formed for the purpose of building nuclear
power stations, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Shell boilers are used for
steam raising and heating purposes in factories and in buildings. Items of steam-raising
plant accessories produced include plain and corrugated boiler furnaces, forced
draught boiler furnaces and grates, stokers, fuel economisers and preheaters, super¬
heaters and desuperheaters, pulverisers, coal and ash handling plant, soot blower
equipment, steam pipework, and feed water heaters.
In 1959, production of shell boilers and boilerhouse plant, much of which is used
in the construction of complete installations, was valued at £25 million, and production
of water tube boiler installations at £59 million. Exports in the same year were valued
at £15-1 million, of which £5-7 million was accounted for by water tube boilers.
Over half the exports went to Commonwealth countries, South Africa being the
largest market.
Nuclear Power Station Plant
The design and construction of nuclear power stations is one of the outstanding
present-day enterprises of British industry. Five major groups of firms were formed
for this purpose, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical engineering, civil
engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries. Some of the original groups
have since joined forces, and for practical purposes there are now only three. In
addition to the nuclear power stations being built for the United Kingdom electricity
authorities, these groups are building such stations in Italy and Japan. Design teams
from the companies concerned have been trained by the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority in the design of gas-cooled graphite-moderated reactors, and the
authority grants them non-exclusive manufacturing licences and keeps them informed
of the results of further research and development work. Industrial firms themselves
are also engaged on research into a range of problems relating to nuclear energy.
Other concerns have also joined together to carry out research into nuclear develop¬
ments and to supply nuclear power plant. Several companies have designed, or have
designs under study for, small nuclear power stations of 11 to 60 MW capacity to be
used for electricity generation. A number of designs have also been produced for
reactors for marine propulsion. Companies have also been established for the manu¬
facture, machining and preparation of graphite for use in reactors. The services of
United Kingdom firms of consulting engineers are being utilised for specification
planning, inspection and advice.
The Nuclear Energy Trade Associations’ Conference (NETAC) was formed towards
the end of 1956 to establish a permanent means of liaison and to pool more effectively
the experience of nuclear development among the firms and trade associations concerned.
Iron, Steel and Non-ferrous Metal Works Plant
As a major steel-producing country, Britain has an expanding industry for the
manufacture of steelworks plant. Up to i939> production fell considerably short
of internal requirements. The post-war modernisation and expansion of the United
Kingdom steel industry have led to the rapid development of the steelworks plant
industry, which today provides about nine-tenths of Britain s requirements for steel-
making equipment and can supply complete plant as efficient and economical in
operation as any in the world.
Some 40 firms produce equipment for making steel in all its stages. In 1945, six
of these firms, together capable of supplying the entire range of steel-making plant.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
336
formed the Metallurgical Equipment Export Company Limited (MEECO) to
co-ordinate export operations and to facilitate the placing of foreign orders in the
United Kingdom for complete steelworks. This group of firms has carried out a
number of large contracts for equipping steelworks in Sweden, Norway, Spain
and France. It forms part of the consortium of British engineering firms constructing
the £100 million steel plant at Durgapur, in India.
The value of deliveries of steel and non-ferrous metal works plant, including rolling
mills, amounted in 1959 to about £51 million, of which over one-quarter was exported.
Petroleum Equipment
Before the second world war, the production of specialised equipment for the
oil industry was on a small scale, but the rapid expansion in oil production and refining
throughout the world has given rise to a substantial export business in British fittings
and plant. The range of products supplied by the engineering industries include
specialised equipment for oil drilling, valves, pumps, meters and gauges, equipment
for oil refineries, and storage tanks. Britain ranks second to the United States as a
supplier of equipment for the petroleum industry.
Chemical Plant
Some 250 firms are engaged in the highly specialised chemical engineering industry,
which designs and supplies all types of plant and equipment for use in the manu¬
facture of chemicals. The range of activities includes the manufacture of distillation
columns, heat exchangers, high vacuum drying equipment, and plants for the manu¬
facture of fertilisers, petroleum chemicals, sulphuric acid and other basic chemicals.
The value of deliveries of chemical plant in 1959 was about £37 million.
Scientific and Industrial Instruments
Scientific instruments have been made commercially in Britain for over three
centuries, early products being chiefly navigational and optical instruments. The last
twenty years have brought a large-scale expansion of capacity in every branch of the
industry to meet defence needs during the war and, later, the expanding world demand
for all types of instruments (optical, mechanical, pneumatic, electrical, electronic and
nucleonic), for both pure and applied science. The sector which is expanding most
rapidly is that making industrial instruments—an essential element in the movement
towards full automation in industry. British scientific instrument manufacturers can
supply all types of instrumentation for research, and of control or automatic devices.
In 1959, total deliveries from scientific and industrial instrument manufacturers
amounted to £94 million, representing an increase in volume of 17 per cent since 1956.
Deliveries for export were worth ^22 million, one of the largest items being aeronautical
instruments. The value of deliveries of industrial process control instruments, including
those made by the manufacturers in the electronics industry, totalled £37 million.
Manufacturers in the office machinery and electronics industries contributed a sub¬
stantial proportion of the deliveries of electronic computers, which amounted to ^8
million in value in 1959.
Clocks and Watches
Britain was at one time the world’s leading producer of clocks and watches, but, by
the end of the nineteenth century, production had virtually died out. The present
industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about 15,000 people, the
great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of the factories are located in the develop-
INDUSTRY
337
ment areas (see p. 256), and particularly in Scotland. In 1959, 8-6 million clocks and
watches, including 2-6 million watches and over 5-0 million mechanical clocks, were
produced, and together with time switches and recorders had a total value of j£i2-8
million. Exports were valued at about £2 million.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The United Kingdom electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manu¬
facture and installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, ranging from giant
generators to domestic appliances and the smallest components of radio receivers. The
total value of its output has risen from about £155 million in 1938 to nearly £1,400
million in 1959, and the volume of production was about 39 per cent higher than in
1954. It exports large quantities of power-station equipment and other electrical
machinery and appliances to all parts of the world. In terms of monetary value it is
one of the two largest exporters of electrical goods in the world, and sends overseas
about a quarter of the value of its output, compared with less than one-eighth in the
immediate pre-war period. The value of exports of all types of electrical equipment in
1959 exceeded £285 million, compared with a previous record of £279 million
in JQS?-
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of more than 770,000, including
213,000 engaged in the manufacture of electrical machinery, and 230,000 in the
production of radio and other electronic equipment. The central organisation of the
industry is the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers’ Association.
Heavy Electrical Plant
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic advances
in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experiments of Michael
Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity as a source of cheap and
abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and patented the first turbo-dynamo,
the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating sets of today. The industry has provided
the plant required for the large-scale post-war expansion programme of the United
Kingdom electricity authorities, and has built all types of equipment for overseas
countries, including the United States. In order to meet the growing volume of orders,
extensions to capacity have been carried out by the principal manufacturers. Manu¬
facture takes place in many areas, among the most important being Manchester, Rugby,
Tyneside, and Stafford. Among the orders on hand are a 275,000 kilowatt (kW)
generating set for commissioning in 1962 and one of 550)000 kW in 1963-
In 1959, more than 1-2 million kW of steam turbine plant of 10,000 kW and over
was exported, an increase of about two-fifths on the 1957 export total, it was also a
record year for output of hydraulic turbines and the total capacity of deliveries exceeded
1-7 million b.h.p. (0-82 million b.h.p. in 1957), almost all of which was for export.
The value of exports of electrical machinery in 1959 totalled £68 million, and included
£37-3 million worth of generating sets, generators and motors, £18-3 million worth of
switchgear, and £ii,2 million worth of transformers.
Radio and Other Electronic Apparatus
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of Britain’s
industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many basic contribu¬
tions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of radar (a British firm
has fitted nearly half the world’s radar-equipped ocean-going ships), the first public
transmission television service, and the ‘printed circuit’ which has led to far-reaching
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
338
changes in methods of production in the radio industry. The volume of the industry’s
output is estimated to have risen by over 50 per cent between 1954 and 1959. Its range
of activities extends from consumer articles, such as television and radio receivers, and
sound reproduction equipment, to complex industrial equipment, including machine-
tool controls, radio and television transmitters (British companies have equipped
television transmission systems throughout the world), air and marine navigation aids,
nucleonic control instruments and data-processing machines. There are eighteen
manufacturers producing some 600 different types of transistors and semi¬
conductor devices.
It is estimated that about 230,000 people are employed in the electronics industry
and that the value of its gross output in 1959 was about ^260 million (excluding
telecommunications equipment). In that year production included 2-84 million tele¬
vision receivers (half as many again as in 1958) and 1-83 million radio receivers
and radiograms.
The value of exports reached the record level of £55 million in 1959 and, in recent
years, exports of capital equipment (for example, marine and air navigation aids)
have tended to expand faster than consumer products. In the same year, exports
of navigational aid equipment were worth ^21-5 million, exports of electronic valves
and cathode ray tubes over £6 million, and those of sound-reproducing equipment and
accessories were valued at ^’9 million. The largest markets include the United States,
Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. Indirect exports in the form of equipment
in other products, for example in aircraft, ships and machinery, are also considerable.
Insulated Wires and Cables
This industry is concerned with the manufacture of cables and wires (including
submarine cables) for the distribution of electric power, for the telephone and telegraph
network and for many other purposes.
In 1959, workers employed in the industry totalled about 62,000. As a result of
recent amalgamations, the two largest firms account for about three-fifths of the total
output. The value of deliveries of insulated wires and cables totalled ^120 million in
1959. The value of exports increased by 88 per cent to over £36 million between
1954 and 1957, falling back to 5^24-9 million in 1959; in some degree, the fall reflected
lower prices. The United States, India and Hong Kong are the largest markets.
Domestic Electrical Appliances
There are some 200 firms, many of them small and serving local markets, in the
United Kingdom manufacturing a wide range of electrical appliances for use in
the home. The removal of controls on hire-purchase transactions in the autumn of
1958 and reductions in purchase tax in the Budgets of 1958 and 1959 brought domestic
sales up to record levels in 1959. In the same year deliveries of domestic washing
machines totalled 1,230,000, valued at £51 million, compared with £24 million
in 1957; exports were worth ^4-9 million. Deliveries of electric irons, nearly one-third
for export, numbered 2,484 million; those of electric cookers 474,000; and those of
vacuum cleaners about 1,651,000, worth over £21 million. Other important products
include electric blankets and pads (£2-6 million) and dry shavers. The value of output
of domestic appliances was about £140 million in 1959.
VEHICLES
Of the engineering and allied industries, the vehicles group (comprising motor
vehicles, cycles, aircraft and railway vehicles) makes the largest contribution to the
INDUSTRY
339
export trade (about £488 million in 1959). In 1959, it employed about 900,000 people,
including 420,000 in the manufacture of motor vehicles and cycles, 280,000 in the
manufacture and repair of aircraft, and 145,000 in the manufacture and repair of
locomotives, railway carriages and wagons. There are also some 300,000 people
employed in garages on motor repairs.
Motor Vehicles
In size and value the vehicles industries are headed by the motor vehicles industry,
which comprises the manufacture of cars, commercial vehicles and tractors (see p.
332). The industry at present is located mainly in the Midlands and the London
area; it consists of a relatively small number of assembly firms—headed by the ‘Big
Five’ (British Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes, Standard, and Vauxhall), backed by a
large number of specialist body and component manufacturers. It has been estimated
that over 50 per cent of the ex-works value of passenger cars consists of components
purchased from the latter. The ‘ Big Five ’ are responsible for about 90 per cent of the
output of complete vehicles of all kinds; the balance of the industry’s motor production
(other than tractors) consists of heavy commercial vehicles, and sports and other
specialist cars.
The industry has expanded very rapidly since 1945, and in 1959 produced the
record number of 1,190,000 passenger cars, 353,000 commercial goods vehicles and
17,400 omnibuses, coaches and trolleybuses. In the first half of i960, output of passenger
cars had risen to an annual rate of i-6 million. Exports of passenger cars in 1959 were
the highest so far reached, 569,000 (including chassis); those of commercial goods
vehicles at 123,000 were 13,000 below the 1955 peak, but in terms of value were the
highest ever recorded. The value of exports of passenger cars totalled ^223 million,
and that of commercial vehicles ^87 million. Exports of parts and accessories (exclud¬
ing rubber tyres and tubes) were valued at £126 million. Bhe largest market for cars
was the United States, which took some 208,000 cars (over one-third of total exports),
followed by Canada, Australia and South Africa. The largest European market
was Sweden.
Research is carried out at Lindley, Warwickshire, by the Motor Industry Research
Association, an autonomous body founded in 1946 and partly financed by the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research, but mainly by the industry itself. Individual
firms also have their own research and development facilities.
The industry, having recently completed a series of large-scale investments costing
^150 million, embarked in i960 on a further substantial expansion of capacity,
provisionally estimated to cost even more than the previous programme. In addition
to developments in existing centres of production, new plants are being established on
Merseyside and in Wales and Scotland.
The principal trade association in the industry is the Society of Motor Manu¬
facturers and Traders (SMMT), founded in ip02, which holds a Motor Show annually
in London, and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Motor Cycles and Pedal Cycles
In 1959, output of motor cycles, including motorised bicycles (mopeds), three¬
wheeled motor vehicles, and scooters, totalled 249,000, of which 43,000 (compared
with 60,000 in 1955) were for shipment overseas, over one-quarter to the United
States. Output of mopeds increased threefold to 79,000 and that of scooters by 10,000
to 29,000, following the introduction of additional models in I95^> The total value of
United Kingdom production of complete machines was about ^25’6 million, and that
34°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of exports about ^5-2 million (about two-fifths to the United States), plus
million worth of parts and accessories.
Production of pedal cycles is likely to be concentrated mainly in a single group
of manufacturers, as a result of an important merger in i960, and this group accounts
for over three-quarters of total production. In addition, there are several smaller
companies, some of which specialise in particular types, such as racing cycles. Output
in 1959 totalled 2,213,000, of which over half were exported. In the peak year of 1955,
nearly 3-6 million were manufactured. The value of exports of pedal cycles, parts and
accessories in 1959 amounted to ^18 million; the United States, Nigeria, Iran and the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, were the largest overseas markets.
The British Cycle and Motor Cycle Industries Association Limited holds a biennial
exhibition in London, usually in the autumn.
Aircraft
The development of the aircraft industry in the United Kingdom, as in other
countries, has been strongly influenced by defence requirements, and at the peak
of war-time activity it employed nearly 2 million people, compared with some 35,000
in 1935. Following the adjustments to peace-time conditions, the industry has under¬
gone a further period of marked expansion, with the numbers employed increasing
from 162,000 in 1951 to 280,000 in 1959. (This represents a drop of some 35,000 from
the post-war peak.) The numbers are tending to fall as a result of changes in defence
policy.
Britain’s achievements in developing aviation and the aircraft industry have been
notable. The science of aerodynamics was founded by Sir George Cayley in the early
nineteenth century; more recently, Sir Frank Whittle developed the gas turbine
aircraft engine, and its first applications to scheduled airline service were the turbo-jet
Comet and the turbo-prop Viscount, the latter probably the most successful post-war
civil aircraft now in service all over the world, about 425 having been sold by June
i960. The larger Britannia, which entered into scheduled service in 1957, was the
first gas turbine airliner to be used on North Atlantic services and has also been ordered
by several overseas airlines. The Comet 4, which went into service in 1958, is being
used by several British and foreign airlines. The Vanguard, a turbo-prop aircraft with
exceptionally low operating costs, entered into service with British European Airways
(BEA) in i960. Other new gas turbine aircraft in production in Britain are the Armstrong
Whitworth Argosy, the Handley Page Herald and the Avro 748. The British Overseas
Airways Corporation (BOAC) has ordered the Vickers VC10 and BEA the Airco
DH121; both aircraft are expected to enter into service in the early 1960s. Britain is
also the largest producer in Europe of rotary wing aircraft, and more than 500 British
helicopters are in service in the world. Orders have been placed for the world’s first
vertical-take-off airliner, the Rotodyne, which made its maiden flight in 1957.
As a result of mergers and reorganisation at the end of 1959 and early in the following
year, the industry is now dominated by five large groups, two being mainly concerned
with airframe manufacture, two with aero-engines and one with helicopters. There are
also a few smaller companies outside these groups. Chief centres for the industry are
London and the Home Counties, Derby, Coventry, Bristol and the West of England
and Scotland. The aircraft industry is also engaged on the development of guided
missiles, some of which have been delivered to the Services.
The British aircraft industry makes an important and growing contribution to
export earnings. The record 1959 total of ^156-1 million brought the total export
earnings in the last five years to £600 million; it included ^64-5 million for aero-engines
INDUSTRY
341
and 5^84-3 million for aircraft and parts. The largest markets for aircraft were India,
Canada, the United States, and Western Germany. Patent and royalty payments from
abroad are also important. Licence agreements have been made for fifteen to twenty
types of British aero-engines to be built abroad, and a number of foreign aircraft have
been designed to use British aero-engines and equipment.
The representative body of the aircraft industry is the Society of British Aircraft
Constructors, founded in 1916. Its annual exhibition and flying display at Farnborough
is one of the most important events of its kind.
Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a substantial scale
on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by the Ministry of Aviation,
chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establish¬
ment, both at Farnborough. This work is done in collaboration with the industry
and results are made known to manufacturers, who are in close touch with the ministry’s
establishments. In addition, the National Physical Laboratory undertakes research
on aerodynamics.
Railway Vehicles
Britain was the first country to build railways, and British engineers pioneered
railway development in most parts of the world.
Locomotive production in the United Kingdom is derived from two separate
sources. British Railways have their own main railway workshops, engaged in the
production and repair of locomotives and other rolling stock and in the production
of miscellaneous railway components exclusively for their own use; and private firms
build locomotives and carriages and wagons of all types for both British Railways
and industrial users in Britain and for export markets. The gross value of annual output
is about £220 million.
The industry is organised to meet the conditions resulting from the change-over
from steam to other forms of traction by most of the world’s railways and by 1959
output of steam locomotives had been reduced to a negligible level. British Railways,
as part of their modernisation programme, had taken delivery of 420 main line diesels
and 85 electric locomotives by the end of i959> anc^ on or<^er at>out 800 and no
respectively. The building programme is being shared between private firms and
British Railways workshops, the latter using engines supplied by electrical equipment
manufacturers.
About 70,000 people were employed in 1959 making locomotives and railway
track equipment and about 75,000 in making and repairing railway carriages and
wagons. In that year the two industries exported 294 diesel and diesel-electric loco¬
motives, 145 electric locomotives, 230 coaching vehicles and nearly 5,000 wagons. The
total value of the industry’s exports was £34 million, a decline of £12 million from the
previous year. South Africa was the most important market by a large margin, follow ed
by India and Pakistan.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL PRODUCTS
The group of industries falling within this classification comprises some 9>500 firms>
according to the 1954 Census of Production, and in 1958, they had a net output valued
at £434 million. The group employs about 530,000 persons. It is composed of some
firms making intermediate products, such as wire, nuts, bolts and screws, drop forgings,
pressings, metal window frames, cans and metal bottles, and others manufacturing a
great variety of finished products ranging from hand tools, cutlery, metal hollow-ware
342
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of all kinds and metal furniture to pins and needles. Its annual capital investment is
about £30 million.
Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Cutlery and Flatware
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred in the city of Sheffield. The
industry has been built up on the high degree of skill of its craftsmen; and while
modern machinery has largely replaced hand forging, and mass production methods
are used today by some firms in producing the cheaper range of products, the highest
quality wares are still produced by skilled craftsmen. Although in recent years there
has been some increase in the size of the production units, they remain mainly small
and, of some 400 establishments manufacturing cutlery and flatware, over 200 still
employ fewer than ten persons.
The annual output of the cutlery and flatware industry is now valued at nearly
j£i2 million, of which nearly ^4 million represents exports, mainly to Australia, the
United States and South Africa.
Domestic Hollow-ware
This industry, with some 250 establishments, is mainly located in the Midlands,
Lancashire, Yorkshire, South Wales and London. About 60,000 people are employed.
It produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets, and dust¬
bins, mainly from wrought steel. There is increasing competition from plastic
hollow-ware.
The value of annual production approaches £20 million, of which nearly one-fifth
represents exports. The principal markets are the United States and Commonwealth
countries, especially West Africa. Aluminium manufacturers comprise the largest
single group, both in the value of total production and in exports.
Hand Tools
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest industries of the United Kingdom.
Over 400 different kinds of hand tools—in many thousands of sizes and patterns—are
made in British factories, with Sheffield, Birmingham and other towns in the Midlands
as the most important centres. The exact number of manufacturers is not known,
but there are believed to be about 400 important producers. They include large
manufacturing firms, some of which have more than 1,000 employees, including
research and design staffs. The ‘do-it-yourself’ movement has given rise to a keen
demand for tools for use in the home and for woodworking.
In 1959, hand tools to the value of £16-5 million were exported. The five largest
markets are Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States and India.
CHEMICALS
It is difficult to define the chemical industry since, with the increasing dependence
of industry generally on synthetic raw materials, its scope is continually widening.
But on the broadest definition the industry includes the manufacture of such products
as acids, alkalis, alcohols, industrial gases, explosives, fertilisers, dyestuffs, soaps and
detergents, petroleum chemicals, plastics materials, paints and pharmaceuticals.
Manufacturing these and other products, the chemical and allied trades (other than
mineral oil refining) employ some 450,000 people and contribute over 8 per cent
of the total net output of all manufacturing industry. Exports of chemicals are also
substantial and increased in value by nearly one-half, and in volume by more than

half between 1954 and 1959, amounting in 1959 to £293 million, or 9 per cent of
total United Kingdom exports. Capital investment in the industry (excluding mineral
oil refining) totalled nearly £900 million in the ten-year period 1948-57, and averaged
nearly £150 million a year in 1958 and 1959.
The British chemical industry has expanded considerably during the present
century. More particularly, recent years have seen a rapid growth which has brought
the industry’s production up to about three times its pre-war level. The volume of
production has doubled since 1948, and the number of employees during that period
rose by about one-fifth. Between 1954 and 1959 output went up by over one-quarter.
This post-war expansion has been most marked in two fields (apart from mineral oil
refining)—production of plastics materials generally, and the large-scale manufacture
of a wide range of organic chemicals from petroleum.
Heavy Chemicals and Dyestuffs
The heavy chemicals sector covers a wide range of acids, alkalis, alcohols, industrial
gases and other basic chemical substances, many of which are fundamental to other
branches of the chemical industry as well as to other industries. Output in 1959 of
sulphuric acid, one of the most important products, at 2-4 million tons, was about two
and a half times the immediate pre-war figure.
Since the war, there has also been a greatly expanded production of raw materials
for the manufacture of synthetic detergents, while trichlorethylene has been in big
demand in the engineering trades for mechanical degreasing plants. Exports of
chemical elements and compounds, which in 1954 were valued at £50-6 million,
had risen to fjo-T, million in 1959; about half were inorganic products and included an
increasingly valuable trade in carbon black. The largest market was India, followed by
Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, Italy, Western Germany and Canada.
The dyestuffs industry also continues to add to the already comprehensive range
of its products, many of them developed from British discoveries in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. Exports of synthetic organic dyestuffs and pigments in 1959
were valued at £12-8 million; production in the same year totalled 34,000 tons.
Petroleum Chemicals
The petroleum chemicals industry in Britain, based on the use of petroleum products
and refinery gases, is the largest in Europe. It provides raw materials for the plastics,
synthetic detergents, solvents, synthetic rubber and other branches of the chemicals
and associated industries. The principal plants are adjacent to the oil refineries at
Fawley (on Southampton Water), Stanlow (in Cheshire) and Grangemouth (in
Scotland), and at Wilton (in Yorkshire). A new centre at Severnside, near Bristol, is
being constructed in stages, and will be linked to Fawley by pipeline. The value of
investments in plant and equipment completed or in hand in t e post PerJ° °
the end of 1962 has been estimated at about £200 million, nearly £150 million fa g
in the period since 1955. The oil companies have a large stake in the industry, re¬
duction in 1959 totalled nearly 380,000 tons (carbon content), over double the 1955
quantity and an increase of 27 per cent over 1958. Hants designed to add substantially
to supplies of basic materials are being brought into production.
Pld.sti.cs
The first plastic, celluloid, originally known as ‘Parkesine’, was produced m Britain
in 1865 by Alexander Parkes. Modern plastics originating in Britain include Perspex
and polyethylene. Since 1939, there has been a very large increase in the total production
M
344
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of plastics materials. Expansion during the last few years has been concentrated mainly
on thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene (used in cable coverings, packaging—
notably for foodstuffs—and domestic mouldings), polystyrene (a cheap non-inflam¬
mable material used for toys, light mouldings and, more recently, for durable consumer
goods), and polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC, and made into industrial conveyor
belting as well as a variety of other consumer goods such as raincoats and curtains).
Britain was the first country to manufacture plastic-coated steel, in 1957.
In the period 1948-59, net sales of plastics materials have multiplied more than
fourfold to a total of 501,000 tons in 1959; compared with 1954, net sales have increased
by over 50 per cent. Thermoplastic materials, which in 1959 accounted for 308,000
tons, have multiplied to nearly two and a half times the 1954 level. Exports have also
grown rapidly, and (including waste and scrap) 157,000 tons, valued at £40 million,
were exported in 1959; over two-fifths of exports go to European countries. The industry
is undertaking large extensions to its productive capacity and is also spending con¬
siderable sums on development of improved materials. Commercial production of
polypropylene began in Britain in 1959 and capacity is being expanded considerably.
Fertilisers
The production of fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of the British scientists,
Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert, and the research now carried on at Rothamsted,
Hertfordshire, and at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen, is of world-wide importance.
Two firms predominate in the production of fertilisers, and both have established in
recent years new large-scale manufacturing facilities. In addition, there are about
seventy firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—
nitrogen, phosphates and potash. To encourage use, sales on the home market are
assisted by Government subsidies. Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of
nitrogen content) in 1959 totalled 350,000 tons, three times the pre-war volume, and
371,000 tons of phosphatic fertilisers were produced (in terms of phosphate content),
more than twice the pre-war figure. Sales in the form of compound fertilisers in
granulated form are increasing; production of these was 2-6 million tons (gross
weight) in 1959.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, almost all in the form of ammonium
sulphate, totalled £3-4 million in 1959, the principal markets being Ceylon and other
Commonwealth countries.
Pesticides and Weedkillers
Important British discoveries in recent years have led to major developments in
the production of selective weedkillers such as methyl-chloro-phenoxy-acetic acid
(MCPA), and of insecticides based on benzenehexachloride (BHC). Overseas markets
take the major proportion of United Kingdom production of these and other well-
known pesticides, such as systemic insecticides; exports reached a value of some £7-4
million in 1959. New products for plant protection, notably new forms of synthetic
hormones, are being developed.
Pharmaceuticals and Toilet Preparations
Many of the pharmaceutical products sold today have been introduced in the
past twenty years. These products include sulphonamides, antibiotics (e.g., penicillin,
whose properties were first discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928), hormones,
anti-malarial drugs (e.g., ‘Paludrine’), liver extracts, anti-histamines and anti-tubercular
drugs. Recent British discoveries include the isolation of the basic molecule of penicillin,
INDUSTRY
345
and a new drug for the treatment of leprosy. Some ^5 million a year is spent on
research, and the value of annual output of pharmaceutical preparations is some ^150
million. About half of the larger drug manufacturing firms in Britain are subsidiaries
of overseas concerns. Total exports of drugs and medicinal preparations and druggists’
wares in 1959 amounted to a value of ^4° million, of which ^8 million worth consisted
of antibiotics.
The toilet preparations, soap, detergents and polishes industries have shown a
steady expansion since the war, and the value of exports was ^26-3 million in 1959,
about one-quarter being detergents and a further quarter, soap. Although many
firms are subsidiaries of American and French companies, there are several wholly
British firms whose products have world-wide sales.
Paints
About 46,000 people are employed in the paint industry. In recent years, the
application of improved techniques has resulted in rapid development, in particular
the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and various types of titanium
dioxide pigment. Production has risen steadily—from about 69 million gallons in
1953 t0 9° million in 1959. The value of direct exports of pigments and paints rose
by nearly a half between 1954 and 1959 to a total of ^26-4 million, of which 9 per cent
represented shipments to Canada, the largest single market. About one-third of the
exports are in the form of ready-mixed paints, which command a growing market
overseas. The industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of surface
coatings for finished goods is also very considerable.
TEXTILES AND CLOTHING
The value of exports in the textiles and clothing group as a whole, including manu¬
factures of wool, cotton, linen, jute, silk, rayon and other man-made fibres, lace,
hosiery, woven apparel and carpets, amounted in 1959 to about £295 million or about
10 per cent of total United Kingdom exports. Nearly 1^ million people were employed
in these industries at the end of 1959, including about 250,000 in the spinning and
weaving of cotton and man-made fibres, 205,000 in the wool textile industry, 85,000
in textile finishing and associated processes, 120,000 in hosiery and knitted goods,
and about 470,000 in clothing (excluding footwear).
Cotton
The invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the second half of the
eighteenth century led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief consumer goods industry
and cotton piece-goods its largest export during the nineteenth century.
In the twentieth century, increasing foreign competition and the tendency of
many countries, notably India, to set up their own textile industry cut progressively
into British markets. During the second world war, numbers of mills were closed
and, while many were brought back into production in the early post-war years, the
industry has recently again been declining in size, although it remains one of the
largest consumer goods industries. The labour force has dropped to under 50 per cent
of the 1937 level, and at the end of 1959, there were about 100,000 persons employed
in the spinning and doubling section of the industry, and 93,000 in weaving. Two-
thirds of the workers in the industry are women.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county being
mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning. Manchester is the
346 BRITAIN : AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
commercial centre. The Cotton Exchange, which deals in raw cotton, is situated
in Liverpool.
Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was introduced in 1959.
Exchequer funds are paying for two-thirds of the cost of removing surplus capacity,
and will also provide a grant of about one-quarter towards the costs of modernisation
and re-equipment. The estimated cost to the Government is about £30 million,
spread over five years. The reorganisation schemes, which have been introduced for the
spinning, doubling and weaving sections of the industry, are administered by the
Cotton Board, a statutory body with the constitution and powers of a development
council. A similar scheme for the finishing sections of the industry came into operation
in August i960. The scrapping of machinery under these schemes has left the industry,
before re-equipment, with about 8| million ring equivalent spinning spindles, i|
million doubling spindles and 160,000 looms.
Production rose steadily from 1945 until the end of i95I> since when the level of
activity has been subject to marked fluctuations. Technical advances, notably the
introduction of new finishes for cotton goods with drip-dry, crease-resisting and
other properties, have helped to widen the industry s markets, but the rising scale
of duty-free imports of grey cloth (352 rnillion square yards in 1959) ^as caused concern.
Agreements have been negotiated with certain other Commonwealth countries to
fix temporary ceilings for such imports. Production of cotton, man-made fibres
and mixture cloth in the industry in 1959 was about 5° Per cent of the 193? level>
and consumption of raw cotton totalled some 284,000 tons, against about 639,000 tons
in 1937. The United States in 1959 supplied about one-quarter of Britain’s imports
of raw cotton, and the second largest supplier was the Sudan, which provides the
bulk of the long-staple varieties.
Exports have suffered as a result of the highly competitive state of the world market
and the tendency for industries, protected by restrictions, to be established in former
markets. In 1959, the value of exports of yarn, thread and woven fabrics amounted to
£63 million. About 347 million square yards of cotton fabrics valued at £45-4 million
were sent overseas, two-thirds to Commonwealth countries, the largest markets
being Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.
The British Cotton Industry Research Association (Shirley Institute), founded
in 1919, undertakes scientific and technical research for the industry.
Wool
The United Kingdom wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most
ancient of Britain’s staple industries and has been an important source of wealth
since medieval times. There are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While
about 85 per cent of woollens and 95 per cent of worsteds are made in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, Scotland and the West of England have retained their importance
as specialised producers of high quality woollen cloth. The woollen side of the industry
is normally organised on a vertical basis, with each firm undertaking the full process of
manufacture from raw material to finished product, but for a variety of reasons the
worsted industry is organised horizontally—combing, spinning and weaving being
done by separate firms. In recent years, however, there has been a tendency in the
worsted industry towards the formation of holding companies controlling a number
of subsidiary combing, spinning and weaving firms, all the worsted processes being
carried out within the one organisation. Small firms, often family concerns, employing
fewer than 300 workers, predominate in the industry. Output reached a post-war
peak at the end of 1950, but this was followed by the recession of 1951-52, which
INDUSTRY
347
reached the lowest point in the middle of 1952. Production subsequently recovered,
and output in some sections in 1957 and again in 1959, exceeded the level of 1950,
although in 1958 the industry experienced a sharp fall in orders. Persons employed in
the industry in December 1959 numbered 205,000.
The United Kingdom’s annual consumption of virgin wool is about 500 million
lb. (clean weight), equivalent to about one-fifth of total world consumption (excluding
Eastern Europe and China), and about 600 million lb. if re-used and re-processed
wools are included. Blending of wool with man-made fibres has been expanding
steadily and accounted for some 10 per cent of total consumption of all fibres used in
the industry in 1959.
The wool industry continues to be one of Britain’s leading export industries, with
about one-quarter of its total output shipped abroad, despite the obstacles in the form
of widespread import restrictions which it has to face. The total value of exports of
woollen and worsted yarns and woven fabrics in 1959 was about £83 million, of which
£23 million represented exports to the United States and Canada and £13 million to
Western Germany; export of wool tops was to the value of £40 million. In addition,
there were considerable exports of wool in other forms, including carpets and clothing.
Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association, which
is financed partly by a statutory levy on the industry and partly by a grant from the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The National Wool Textile Export Corporation, which is financed by a statutory
levy on the industry, is responsible for assistance to exporters and for developing
overseas markets.
Man-made Fibres
Exports of all types of man-made fibres in 1959 totalled £27-1 million (slightly less
than in 1958), of which £16 million was accounted for by yarns and over £10-5 million
by fabrics. Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa were the largest markets.
Rayon is produced from cellulose, in the form of either woodpulp or cotton Enters.
Its early development took place to a large extent in Britain. Production is spread
throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas. There are
seven companies engaged in the production of rayon, four producing only viscose,
two producing only acetate, and one both viscose and acetate. One company accounts
for over four-fifths of total output, and also has extensive manufacturing interests
throughout the world. Annual average production has in recent years been of the
order of 420 million pounds (lb.), of which about 240 million lb. was in the form of
staple fibre—about ten times the pre-war average. The central research station of the
industry is that of the British Rayon Research Association at Wythenshawe, Manchester.
Nylon is produced from a combination of chemical substances, most of which
are obtained from indigenous raw materials. Production of nylon yarn started in
Britain in 1941 for military uses, such as parachutes. Large-scale production began
at Pontypool, in South Wales, in 1948. Capacity at this plant has been greatly increased
and other factories came into operation at Doncaster, in Yorkshire, in 1955, an
Brockworth, near Gloucester, in i960. Nylon is used extensively for clothing fabrics
and stockings and has wide industrial uses, including the manufacture of tyre cords,
fishing nets, fire hose, ropes and conveyor belts. Annual productive capacity is expected
to reach 60 million lb. by 1961.
‘ Terylene’ polyester fibre, a product of research in the laboratories of the Calico
Printers’ Association, Manchester, is made on a large scale at Wilton, Yorkshire,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
348
by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. Annual productive capacity was increased to
30 million pounds weight in 1959, and a new plant under construction, also at Wilton,
will raise this to 50 million lb. A plant for the manufacture of ‘Terylene’ has been
set up in Canada, and the British patent holders have licensed its manufacture in
other countries, including France, the German Federal Republic, Italy, the Netherlands,
and Japan.
‘Fibrolane' is a British-made protein fibre, with wool-like properties, derived from
casein. Other man-made fibres at present produced in Britain include ‘Courlene’ (a
polythene fibre), and ‘Alginate' (derived from seaweed).
‘Courtelle', an acrylic fibre, has been manufactured on a commercial scale at
Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, since early in 1959. Annual productive capacity is being
doubled to 22 million lb. by 1961. A plant to manufacture another acrylic fibre,
‘Acrilan', started operating at Coleraine, in Northern Ireland, early in 1959.
Since the advent of rayon in its various forms and, more recently, of the new man¬
made fibres, British textile manufacturers have been developing a number of ways of
blending these with natural fibres and with each other. By this means they can produce
economically fabrics and garments with attractive and useful new combinations
of texture, colour and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-wearing, drip-dry
and crease-resisting properties.
Hosiery and Knitwear
The hosiery and knitwear industry employs about 120,000 workers, of whom two-
thirds are women. About 80 per cent of the 1,100 firms in the industry employ fewer
than 50 workers, and only three manufacturers have more than 4,000 employees. The
industry is widely distributed throughout Great Britain, with Scotland and the east
Midlands as the two most important centres. Annual consumption of yarns totals
about 80,000 tons, nearly half of which are woollen yarns, and a growing proportion
are of fully synthetic fibres. Exports of stockings and socks in 1959 were worth £3-5
million, Canada being the largest market; while those of knitted underwear and outer¬
wear totalled £7-4 million, sales to the largest buyer, the United States, totalling over £2
million. Exports of knitted fabrics amounted to £2-8 million, mainly to Commonwealth
countries.
The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research Association, with laboratories at
Nottingham, undertakes collective research, and is particularly concerned with the
improvement of quality.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was already being practised during the seventh century.
Today it is an industry mainly of comparatively small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland
(the greatest linen manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder
in Scotland. The principal raw material of the industry is flax, which is almost wholly
imported (the chief supplier is Belgium), but considerable quantities of man-made
fibres and cotton are also used, and a certain amount of soft hemp and jute, particularly
in Scotland. Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on the
lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely, but not exclusively, of
coarse linens and canvas. In the ten years to i960, the industry’s investments in new
plant and machinery amounted to £12 million. The Northern Ireland Government
has given financial aid for re-equipment. Exports were valued at £16 million in 1959,
INDUSTRY
349
including j£8-6 million worth of linen fabrics, £2 million of flax linen yarns and
£955,200 of damask table linen. Technical problems are investigated by the Research
Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in 1919.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee—the centre of the world’s oldest
jute industry. About 40 per cent of jute yarn production is utilised in the manufacture
of carpets, cordage, ropes and other products. The balance is woven into fabrics for a
wide range of uses, but principally for packaging material. Annual production of jute
tissues averages about 80,000 tons. Some 18,000 workers are employed. The value of
exports in 1959 totalled about £4 million (including second-hand sacks and bags).
Research facilities are concentrated at the laboratories of the British Jute Trade
Research Association. About £11-5 million has been spent on a post-war modernisation
programme, and productivity in the industry is estimated to have risen by 40 per cent
in the past ten years.
Silk exports were valued at about £07 million in 1959. Raw silk is supplied mainly
from Japan, China and Italy. Production has been expanding, and deliveries of silk
and silk mixture woven piece-goods in 1959 totalled 3-2 million square yards, an increase
of one-quarter over the previous year. About 750,000 square yards were exported
in 1959-
Clothing
The clothing industry in Britain, the largest in Europe, is one of the most important
employers of labour with about 450,000 workers, three-quarters of whom are women
and girls. It had a gross annual output valued at over £500 million (including hats
and other millinery) in 1958. Although there are some large firms employing mass
production methods on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. Unofficial estimates
suggest that five-sixths of the concerns in the industry employ fewer than too workers.
The principal manufacturing centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several
firms are also situated on the industrial trading estates.
Both the textile trades and the ready-to-wear clothes industries are engaged in
promoting British fashions. The fashion industry, principally through the Apparel
and Fashion Industry’s Association and the Fashion House Group of London Ltd.,
and the textile trades, through the Textile and London Fashion Organisation, arrange
fashion shows. In the haute coutuve branch of the trade, models are shown by the
Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers.
Carpets
There are some 70 manufacturers in the United Kingdom of the traditional
Axminster and Wilton carpets, ranging in size from enterprises with several thousand
employees to very small firms with only a few workers. In addition, there is also an
expanding branch of the industry engaged in making tufted carpets, a form of carpeting
in which the pile, usually containing a high proportion of artificial fibres, is inserted
into a pre-woven backing. Over 30>000 workers are employed, and the principal
manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in Worcestershire), Halifax and
Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire), Durham, Glasgow and Kilmarnock
(in Scotland). Wool accounts for about 90 per cent of the raw materials used in the
surface yarns in carpet manufacture, and, in fact, more than two-thirds of the traditional
carpets produced are of a pure woollen or worsted pile.
According to the Federation of British Carpet Manufacturers, 1959 was the most
successful year in the history of the industry. Sales (at ex-factory values) totalled
71-4 million square yards, valued at £89-9 iffiffi°n> compared with £85-6 million in
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
35°
1958. Exports, however, have been faced with import restrictions in overseas markets,
and the 1959 total at a value of £6-9 million was the lowest for several years.
FOOD, DRINK AND TOBACCO
The industries coming within the food, drink and and tobacco group employ more
than 900,000 people, and the annual value of their exports averages about £200 million.
Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Bread and Flour Confectionery and Biscuits
The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population in
Great Britain in 1959 was about 3 lb., about ^ lb. less than in 1954. In England
and Wales particularly, the small ‘family’ type of baker, producing bread by hand or
by semi-mechanical methods, is still numerous, but there has been an uninterrupted
trend towards concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries; about two-thirds
of the bread is made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves;
four firms have a dominant position. In the smaller bakeries, numbering about 12,000,
production of cake and other flour confectionery is usually allied to bread production.
Some 186,000 people are employed in the bread and flour confectionery industry.
Production of biscuits, of which there are about 220 manufacturers with some 55,000
employees, is estimated to be about 75 per cent higher than in the immediate pre-war
period. Annual output has been about 520,000 tons in recent years. Weekly consumption
of biscuits per head in Britain was about 5^ oz. in 1959- British biscuits have gained a
world-wide reputation, and despite the problem of import restrictions in several over¬
seas markets, exports in 1959 were valued at £5-8 million.
Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which employs some 105,000
persons, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and many hundreds
of medium-sized and small manufacturers. The industry’s products are highly
competitive and highly advertised. Over 90 per cent of the production of chocolate
and sugar confectionery is in the hands of about 100 firms, while the more specialised
products—cocoa powder, cocoa butter and chocolate covering—are manufactured
by about 50 firms.
The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk,
nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and sugar confectionery for home and export
sale totalled about 620,000 tons in 1959, the lowest total since I952- There are virtually
no restrictions on imports of chocolate and confectionery, but these totalled less than
7,000 tons in 1959. Consumption of chocolate and sugar confectionery in the United
Kingdom is far higher than in any other country, being equivalent to about 7! oz.
per head per week in 1959, compared with 7 oz. per head before the war. In 1959*
the value of exports of chocolate, sugar confectionery and cocoa products totalled
^17-7 million, compared with a record level of over £19 million in 1955. About three-
fifths of exports consist of cocoa products and chocolate, and about one-third goes to
dollar markets. Manufacturers’ total annual turnover is well over £200 million.
Jams and Marmalades
The jams and marmalades industry in the United Kingdom is highly competitive,
with the three largest manufacturers accounting for some two-thirds of the total output.
Changes in the pattern of consumer expenditure on food in the past ten years have
led to a gradual fall in production—from 329,000 tons in 1949 to 206,000 tons in
INDUSTRY
351
1959. The value of output in 1959 was about £30 million. Strawberry, raspberry and
blackcurrant jams have the largest sales. There is a sizable export trade in high-quality
products, especially marmalade, and £1-6 million worth was exported in 1959.
Canned Foods and Quick-Frozen Foods
The British Navy was using canned foods as long ago as 1813, but it was not until
the present century that a considerable industry developed. Rapid expansion has
taken place since 1935, and the annual sales of the industry are now believed to be
worth some £200 million.
By far the largest product of the canning industry is vegetables, of which 563,000
tons were produced in 1959; over one-third is processed peas, while output of beans
in tomato sauce is almost as large. About 100,000 tons of fruit are canned annually.
Plums are the most important home-produced fruit canned, but there is also a large
production of fruit salad from imported fruit. Canned soup production has increased by
over three-quarters since 1953, totalling 161,000 tons in 1959, worth about £25 million,
although it is meeting increased competition from packaged soups. Canned meat
production has also risen sharply, the 1959 total of 50,000 tons being double that of
1954. About 75,000 workers are employed in preserving fruit and vegetables. Exports
of canned vegetables in 1959 reached a value of £1-4 million. Basic research is under¬
taken by the British Food Manufacturing Industries Research Association, and the
Fruit and Vegetable Canning and Quick Freezing Research Association.
The quick-freezing of foods has been expanding rapidly in Britain, particularly since
1954, and about 380 million packs were sold in 1959. The most important products are
white fish—some 42,000 tons were quick-frozen in 1959—and vegetables, about two-
thirds being peas. There are about 600 varieties of quick-frozen foods available,
including fruit, poultry, meat and, to an increasing extent, ready-prepared foods.
Whisky
Scotch whisky, which was first distilled at least as long ago as the fifteenth century,
enjoys world-wide popularity. Whiskies are blends of twenty or more different kinds,
some made from malted barley, some from other grains. Whisky requires several years
to mature, and the 57 million proof gallons (a record) produced in 1959 will not be on
sale for some years. Stocks of whisky amount to about 265 million proof gallons, of
which over one-third has been in stock for more than three years. Whisky is one of the
United Kingdom’s largest dollar earners; more than half the annual exports (nearly
three-quarters of the annual sales are to overseas buyers), which in 1959 attained the
highest level so far recorded of £61-9 million, are shipped to the United States. Other
valuable markets are Canada and other Commonwealth countries, Venezuela and
Western Germany.
Gin
Production of gin in the United Kingdom has risen steadily since 1952, and in
1959 amounted to about 7 million proof gallons (an increase of nearly half since I952)>
over one-third of which was exported. The main distilleries are situated in London,
and one group of companies accounts for about half the total output. Although most
of the larger manufacturers also have distilleries overseas, exports have expanded,
and in 1959 were worth £4-2 million, the United States being by far the largest market.
Brewing and Malting
Brewing. There are some 300 separate breweries located throughout the United
Kingdom, of which the main centres are London, south Lancashire, Burton-on-
352
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trent (Staffordshire), Birmingham, and Edinburgh. In the main, brewers distribute
their beer for consumption within 40 miles of the brewery, but some of the largest
firms send their beer all over the country. In recent years there has been a strong
tendency towards the creation of larger brewery units. Much of the beer is consumed in
draught, but in recent years the demand for bottled beer has increased and is now
probably about two-fifths of total consumption compared with one-quarter before the
war. Bottling is carried out by both brewers and independent bottling establishments.
The industry’s raw materials are malt (chiefly made from home-grown barley), sugar
and hops. Consumption of beer has declined appreciably from the exceptional levels
of the immediate post-war years; the drop was, however, largely halted in 1951,
and demand in 1959 was appreciably higher than for some years. Canned beer is
becoming increasingly popular. Substantial capital investment, estimated at about £8
million a year, is being undertaken, together with a similar sum for the installation of
bottling equipment. The excise duty on beer accounts for about one-third of the retail
price. In the year ended 31st March, i960, duty of £219 million was paid on over 26
million bulk barrels. Since the war the industry has maintained a sizable export
trade, which in 1959 was valued at £2-6 million.
Malting. There are several hundred malting units in the United Kingdom. Some
of these are operated by brewers who make all or part of their own malt. The remainder
are operated by maltsters whose product is sold principally to brewers at home and
abroad, but some malt is supplied to distillers and vinegar brewers, and also to the
manufacturers of malt extract for use in the baking, confectionery and textile industries.
The popularity of British malt has been established with brewers throughout the world,
and in 1959 malt exports were valued at £1-7 million. These malting units are mainly
situated in the barley-growing areas which lie east of a line drawn from Edinburgh,
through Burton-on-Trent (Staffordshire), to Lyme Regis (Dorset).
Malting usually takes place in the cooler months following the harvest, but with
the aid of air-conditioning plant and other modern developments some units can
operate throughout the year. Grain is the only raw material used by the industry—
chiefly home-grown barley especially grown for the purpose.
Soft Drinks
The rapid expansion of the soft drinks industry in the years since the second
world war, and especially since 1954, reflects both changes in public taste and rising
standards of living. The industry’s output in 1959 was estimated at 421 million gallons
in terms of ready-to-drink liquid, about equally divided between concentrated and
unconcentrated drinks. The hot dry summer of 1959 resulted in an increase of about
one-quarter in output over 1958, and about 300 million gallons over the 1939 total.
The industry may be divided into three broad groups: several hundred small manu¬
facturers; about 300 larger firms supplying a regional market only; and some 20
firms producing widely advertised brands which are marketed on a national scale.
There is also some degree of specialisation by firms in the production of the various
types—e.g., carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters
and ‘mixers’, and comminuted drinks (in which the whole fruit is used).
Tobacco
The United Kingdom tobacco industry, which employs some 48,000 people,
manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other tobacco goods sold in the country.
I959> personal expenditure on these goods amounted to £1,080 million (of which
over two-thirds was tax revenue) and, in addition, exports worth £19 million (some 90
INDUSTRY
353
per cent of which were cigarettes) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets.
The main centres of production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London,
Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two largest manu¬
facturing groups now account for about 90 per cent of output, compared with 80
per cent some eight years ago.
The tobacco industry uses over 300 million lb. annually of raw tobacco of all types,
all of which is imported. The main sources are the United States, Rhodesia, India
and Canada, in that order. Most of this tobacco goes to make cigarettes (nearly seven-
eighths) and pipe and cigarette tobaccos. Production of cigarettes for the home market
in 1959 is estimated at 106,600 million, about 12 per cent of sales being in the form of
filter-tipped brands, with the demand for ‘king-size’ (i.e. larger) types rising markedly.
Cigars account for less than ^ per cent of tobacco consumption, but sales doubled
between 1954 and 1959 to about 300 million. Although the great majority are made in
Britain, many of the best grades are imported, mainly from Cuba, Jamaica and the
Netherlands.
MISCELLANEOUS INDUSTRIES
This broad heading covers a very wide variety of industries and groups of industries,
from building materials to toys, employing over 1-7 million people at the end of 1959.
Notes on some of these industries are given below.
Brickmaking
Introduced by the Romans, brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, and
something like 2,000 different varieties of building bricks are produced in the United
Kingdom today. These are made in some 800 works which range from small seasonal
yards using traditional hand methods to highly mechanised plants. More than two-
fifths of production consists of the Fletton type of brick, demand for which is steadily
increasing and which is made mainly in the Peterborough and Bedfordshire areas.
The chief producer is the largest brick manufacturing company in the world. The high
level of activity in the building industry in 1959 brought production up to nearly 7,000
million bricks, or 10 per cent more than in I95^'
Refractories
Refractories are essential in the operation of blast furnaces, steel furnaces and other
metallic furnaces and are used extensively in many other industries, including non-
ferrous metals, ceramics, glassware and chemicals, in nuclear energy and jet propulsion.
The chief raw materials required for their manufacture are indigenous except for
magnesite (which is obtained partly from overseas and partly from production of
sea-water magnesia) and chrome ore.
The chief centres of the industry are in the Midlands, west Yorkshire, north-east
England, Scotland, and Wales. Production has averaged about 2 million tons a year
since 1948, mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction materials in 1959
were valued at about ^3-6 million, compared with ^2*8 million in 1955*
Domestic Pottery
The domestic pottery industry is one of the oldest craft industries in Britain;
the making of domestic pottery dates back to before the Roman occupation. The
chief raw materials, china clay, ball clay and china stone, come from Devon Cornwall
and Dorset, where known deposits of high quality are expected to last for at least
100 years.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
354
The Stoke-on-Trent area in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns of Stoke,
Burslem, Tunstall, Hanley, Fenton and Longton, is the centre of the industry and
95 per cent of production capacity is concentrated in that area. Other important
factories are at Worcester, Derby, Bristol and Poole. The industry employs about
35,000 workers, of whom more than half are engaged in the production of table and
ornamental ware.
Of the £32 million worth of pottery produced in 1959, over £14 million worth
was for export. About three-quarters of bone china exports go to Canada and the
United States, and the largest markets for decorated earthenware are Canada,
Australia and the United States.
The modern industry benefits from a tradition of good design and craftsmanship
(made world-famous by a long line of great British potters) which, with the excellent
technical qualities of its products, is the basis of the large overseas and domestic
demand. Among the famous makes of British pottery are: Wedgwood, Spode, Royal
Worcester, Royal Doulton and Royal Crown Derby.
Early in i960, the pottery industry started production of felspathic-type pottery
under the name of English Translucent China.
Glass
Britain has a large and efficient glass industry, the third largest in the world, with
a wide diversity of products, employing some 77,000 workers. The section of the industry
devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various forms is organised
for quantity production, and the development of modern methods has enabled the
industry to cater for an increasing range of requirements. Glass can now be supplied
in sheets of great size and can be made almost unbreakable. Its use for internal decora¬
tion and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years.
Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry. A British firm
has developed, at a cost of £4 million, a revolutionary glass-making process for
producing ‘float glass’.
Rapid technical progress has led to the large-scale production of tubular glass,
optical glass and also glass insulators for use in electricity transmission. Glass fibres,
used for insulating purposes and as reinforcement for plastics, are thought to offer
great scope for further development. They are being used in the manufacture of a
wide range of products including travel goods, boats and perambulators. Bottles and
jars, table ware and lamp bulbs are now made by completely automatic machinery
and the advance of the industry is shown by the increase in exports of all glassware
(including plate and sheet glass) from a negligible level in 1938 to a value of ^18-5
million in 1959; this total included £11 million worth of plate and sheet glass, of
which one-quarter was exported to North America. Exports of vacuum flasks and
illuminating glassware accounted for a further ^1-3 million.
A traditional product is hand-made lead-crystal glassware of very high quality;
a high proportion of output is exported, mostly to Australia, South Africa, New
Zealand, Canada, and the United States.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research Asso¬
ciation, and much research work is also carried on by the Department of Glass
Technology at Sheffield University, the first of its kind in the world.
Cement
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the manu¬
facture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824, this
INDUSTRY
355
material and the methods of its production have been the subject of continuous
technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity of the industry, which
employs about 16,000 people, has increased substantially since the war to meet the
growing demands of the building industry. About one-third of production comes
from plants situated in the Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent. Annual output,
which reached 7-7 million tons in 1938 had risen to 12-6 million tons in 1959. One
group of companies is responsible for about two-thirds of total output. In 1959,
i-1 million tons (valued at £6-5 million) were exported, half to West Africa, compared
with a peak total of 2-06 million tons in 1952; the fall reflects the expansion of production
capacity in overseas countries.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware is an industry in which British
craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. About 30,000 are employed. The quality of
the metal in gold and silver wares made or sold in the United Kingdom is guaranteed
by a ‘hall-mark’. The law requires that gold and silver plate shall not be sold until it
has been hall-marked at one of the six Assay Offices situated in London, Birmingham,
Chester, Sheffield, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. The Birmingham office, located in the
main centre of the jewellery industry, probably hall-marks more gold and silver than
the rest together. A departmental committee has recommended, in a report published
in March 1959, that the number of assay offices should be reduced to four, that hall¬
marks should also be applied to platinum, and that statutory regulations should
be strengthened.
The importance of maintaining definite standards of fineness for wares of gold and
silver has always been recognised, and the Goldsmiths’ Company in London has
carried out the assay and hall-marking of such wares since 1327 when Edward III
gave the company its first charter.
Toys
The toy industry in Britain, the largest in Europe, has expanded greatly in the last
ten years. There are over 300 manufacturers, most firms being small; the dozen largest
are responsible for half the output which, in 1959, amounted in value to just over £36
million. Exports in that year were valued at about £8 million, compared with ^0-5
million in 1938; Australia, Canada and the United States are the leading markets.
The industry estimates that annual expenditure in the United Kingdom on toys
averages £5 per child. Current trends are towards increased production of small-
scale precision models of equipment and vehicles and a greater use of plastics materials,
but demand for traditional lines, such as toy soldiers, train sets and dolls, remains
unaffected.
Leather
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. I anneries are situated in most
parts of Britain, but there are important concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire,
Yorkshire, the north Midlands and the London area. Many different types of leather
are produced, ranging from the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery
belting to car upholstery leather, high quality leather for footwear and for leather goods,
and also gloving and clothing leather.
At the end of 1959, about 31,000 persons were employed in the leather tanning
and dressing and associated industries, and 24,000 in the leather goods industries.
The United Kingdom is the world’s leading leather exporter, with exports valued
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
356
in 1959 at j£i8-9 million, of which lyq million worth went to the United States, £2-3
million to Canada, £2-1 million to Western Germany and £1-4 million to Italy.
Research into tanning processes and the improvement of the quality of finished
leather is undertaken by the British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association, the
foremost research association of this type.
Leather Footwear
The British footwear industry is among the most important in the world, and
factories are located throughout the United Kingdom. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types, e.g., the Rossendale Valley region of Lancashire for
slippers, Bristol for heavy industrial footwear for miners and agricultural workers,
Northampton for men’s and youths footwear, and Leicester and Norwich for women s
and girls’ shoes. There are about 430 firms in the industry, producing footwear of all
types. The British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world¬
wide reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
At the end of 1959, some 116,000 persons were employed in the manufacture of
footwear (excluding rubber footwear); in that year, output totalled 147 million pairs,
of which 125 million pairs represented boots and shoes made mainly of leather. The
United Kingdom is the world’s second largest exporter of leather footwear, and in
!959> 7‘5 million pairs, valued at over £10-5 million, were exported. The United
States took over one-fifth of these exports and Canada over one-tenth.
Paper and Board
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until 1678,
but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year 1492.
About two-thirds of the many different materials, totalling some 3-8 million tons
a year, used by the industry come from abroad. The balance consists mainly of waste
paper recovered from domestic sources.
Total production in 1959 of all types of paper and board (including newsprint)
amounted to 3-66 million tons—the highest ever reached—compared with a pre-war
figure of 2 million tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 669,000 tons, against 800,000
tons pre-war; since i953> output of board has risen by one-third, mainly as a result
of its growing use as packaging material. Exports in 1959 amounted to 198,000 tons,
valued at £25-3 million, including 81,000 tons of newsprint, valued at £4-9 million,
and £5-8 million worth of other printing paper. The bulk of the export trade is to
sterling area countries, mainly Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Irish Republic,
and India.
The industry comprises some 200 mills producing almost every type of paper and
board. There were over 90,000 employees at the end of 1959 and the gross value of
output exceeded £300 million. There are also many firms engaged in the conversion
of paper and board for various purposes. Considerable interests are held abroad,
including pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada and other parts
of the Commonwealth, and in Europe.
Domestic Furniture
Although the domestic furniture industry in Britain still contains small firms,
in the last decade, the total number of firms has dropped by about one-third to under
2,000, and the tendency is for the large units to grow even larger. London is the largest
centre for furniture manufacturing, but nearly one-tenth of the total output comes
from High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire. Some 70,000 workers are employed.
INDUSTRY
357
The value of output of firms with over 10 operatives totalled nearly ^123 million in
1959- ^ Furniture Development Council was established in 1949, under the Develop¬
ment Councils Act of 1947* to improve the efficiency of the industry. It undertakes
research, training and education in technical and artistic subjects, provides a technical
information service and publishes statistics.
Printing and Publishing
Printing is essentially an industry of small enterprises. At least two-thirds of the
6,000 firms have fewer than 25 employees. The main sections of the industry are concen¬
trated in the larger towns, notably London, although firms engaged in more general
printing are also located in smaller centres. The shortage of skilled workers has
led firms to introduce the latest developments in high-speed printing equipment,
including electronic engraving machines and advanced processes of photographic
reproduction. Capital investment on plant and machinery is approaching £20 million
a year. The annual turnover of the general printing, bookbinding and publishing
industries, in which about 253,000 people are employed, exceeds £300 million. About
127,800 are engaged in the printing and publishing of newspapers and periodicals,
with an annual turnover of about £300 million.
Book publishing1 is predominantly an industry of small firms, mostly concentrated
in London. Excluding H.M. Stationery Office, which is responsible for Government
publications, only 10 of the several hundred publishing firms bring out more than 200
new titles each year, and a further 13 between 100 and 200. Amalgamations have
led to the establishment of larger units in recent years. Popularity of paper-backed
books has increased rapidly, and sales, some 70 million copies in 1959, have more
than trebled since 1953.
In 1959, total sales of books amounted to about million, and the value of
exports reached the record level of £25-4. million. Australia, the United States, and
South Africa are the most important overseas markets.
Rubber
The United Kingdom rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world,
dating from 1819 when Hancock, the inventor of the first method of processing
raw rubber on a commercial scale, set up a factory in London. He afterwards collaborated
with Macintosh, the inventor of waterproof garments, and it was another Scotsman,
Dunlop, who in 1888 devised the pneumatic tyre. At the present day, tyres and tubes
represent more than half the total output of the industry. More recently, British
firms have pioneered cellular rubber and latex foam products, and they also make
a great variety of other rubber manufactures, the most important being rubber footwear,
conveyor belting, cables, hose and thread.
The industry is second in size only to that of the United States. There are some
600 firms located throughout the country, employing about 121,000 people and, in
1959, their consumption of rubber totalled 295,000 tons, including 35,600 tons of
reclaimed rubber. There are 14 tyre manufacturers, including several subsidiaries of
United States companies. In 1959, they produced some 30 million tyres, of which 11
million were for cars and 13 million for bicycles. Exports of manufactured goods in
the same year were valued at £29'7 million, two-thirds in the form of tyres and tubes.
This figure does not take into account the large indirect exports on motor vehicles.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
358
The large manufacturers undertake research on a considerable scale into new methods
and materials and, in addition, advanced research work is carried out at the Shrewsbury
Laboratories of the Research Association of British Rubber Manufacturers.
Synthetic Rubber
A synthetic rubber plant at Hythe, near Southampton, using raw materials from
the nearby oil refinery at Fawley, started operating in Its annual capacity by
the end of i960 will be 90,000 tons of styrene-butadiene rubber. There are also several
smaller plants supplying special-purpose synthetic rubbers, the largest of these was
opened in Northern Ireland in i960 to make neoprene rubber.
XI. TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
About 17 per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage of 100 gross tons and over is
registered in the United Kingdom, which has the largest merchant marine in active
employment. If the tonnage in the United States reserve fleet and the tonnage
employed on the Great Lakes is excluded, the United Kingdom’s proportion of world
shipping tonnage is about 19 per cent. United Kingdom ships are estimated to carry
nearly one-fifth of the world’s international sea-borne passenger and goods traffic,
and ply regularly on the routes linking the countries of the Commonwealth and also
to most of the main ports throughout the world. The amount of the United Kingdom’s
own sea-borne trade carried in British ships is not known exactly, but it has been
estimated that about 60 per cent of its imports and 75 per cent of its exports, by
value, are carried in British registered ships. Shipping provides one of the largest
net contributions to the balance of payments; a survey by the General Council of
British Shipping showed that in 1958 the total net overseas earnings by all types of
United Kingdom shipping was £135 million.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
A total of 20-8 million gross tons of merchant shipping (steam and motor vessels of
100 gross tons and over) was registered in the United Kingdom at 30th June, 1959, the
largest tonnage ever recorded.
Recent trends in the composition of the merchant fleet have been the reduction
of tramp tonnage, the growth of tanker tonnage, the increasing size of tankers, and the
commissioning of vessels specially built to carry ore, sugar and other commodities in
bulk. Including Admiralty and other tankers, the United Kingdom accounts for over
6 4 million gross tons or nearly 17 per cent of the world’s total tanker tonnage.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage stood at some 600,000 gross tons in 1959 and
continues to fall. Oil has taken the place of coal in steamships, while steam has con¬
tinued to give place to the diesel engine, more than 47 per cent of all tonnage being
diesel-driven in 1959. The first new ocean-going cargo ship to be powered by free piston
engines was launched on Clydeside in January 1959- The Ministry of Transport,
with the co-operation of shipowning, shipbuilding and marine engineering industries,
is investigating the possibility of applying nuclear propulsion to mere ant s ips.
Age and Size
Over 2C per cent of the total gross tonnage is under 5 years old and a further 20
per cent is between S and 9 years old. Of the tanker fleet, 3+ per cent is under 5 years
old and a further 29 per cent is from 5 to 9 years old. An analysis of the merchan.
fleet by size is given in Table 23.

In 1959, the four liners of 30,000 gross tons and over were the Queen Elizabeth
(83,673 g.t.), the Queen Mary (81,237 g.t.), the Mauretania (35,673 g.t.), and the
Caronia (34,173 g.t.), all operating on transatlantic passenger services. Proposals made
by the Cunard Company to replace the two Queens (launched more than 20 years ago)
were considered by a small committee set up by the Government; in June i960, it
recommended that a 75,000 ton liner to maintain British express passenger services
across the Atlantic should be built with Government assistance in the form of a
substantial loan. An extensive programme of replacement of their fleets of passenger
liners is being carried out by other shipping lines, and the two largest liners to be built
in Britain since 1939 were launched in 1959 and i960, the Oriana (40,000 g.t.) and the
Canberra (45,000 g.t.); both are for the services from Britain to Australia and across the
Pacific to North America. Several oil tankers of more than 40,000 d.w.t. have been
built in British yards for the United Kingdom oil companies.
Employment of Shipping
In June 1959, 17-5 million gross tons of trading vessels of 500 gross tons and over
were owned and registered in the United Kingdom.1 The usual employment of this
fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping as follows:
8-6 million gross tons were employed as ocean-going passenger and cargo liners;
2-8 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 5 million gross tons as ocean-going
tankers; and 1 • 1 million gross tons as coastal and home trade.
SHIPOWNERS
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom consists
of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter. Practically all
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Admiralty
vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of cargo, and shipping
registered in the United Kingdom but owned in other Commonwealth countries (including
nearly half a million gross tons of tankers).
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
361
these ships are owned by large liner companies or groups of liner companies. Many
of them operate wide networks of scheduled freight and passenger services which,
between them, cover every ocean. The 2-8 million gross tons of ocean-going tramp
ships are operated by a large number of private owners, some of them having only a
small number of ships and some with only one ship.
The British shipping industry is composed of some 270 companies, but about half
the tonnage is owned by nine or ten main groups controlling over fifty companies.
The many world-famous British shipping lines operating services on international
routes include: the Cunard, to North America; the Royal Mail, to South America;
the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far East; the Peninsular and Oriental (P. and O.)
and the British India lines, to India and Australia; the Orient line to Australia; the
Union Castle, to South Africa; Elder Dempster, to West Africa; Furness Withy, to
North America and the West Indies; the New Zealand line to North America, Australia
and New Zealand; and Shaw Savill and Albion, to Australia.
About two-thirds of the total United Kingdom tanker fleet belongs to the oil
companies, although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—is now
coming into use on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly owned
by companies in the steel industry, but are managed and operated by shipping
companies.
Unlike ship-owning companies in many countries, the United Kingdom ship¬
owners receive no subsidies or other direct financial assistance from the Go\ ernment.
The Government has, however, recognised that the United Kingdom shipping
industry is faced with severe competition in a world market (especially from ships
sailing under 'flags of convenience with small tax liabilities) and that the industry
has found it increasingly difficult to build up finance for the replacement of ships.
In 1956 the shipping industry was the only industry allowed to retain the 20 per cent
investment allowance in respect of taxation, which was withdrawn from industry
generally (but restored in 1959)- The allowance was raised to 40 per cent in 195?
capital expenditure on the construction of new ships.
SHIPPING ORGANISATIONS
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
The Society of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the late seventeenth century, is an incorporated
society of underwriters whose main business is marine insuiance (see p. 4I^)‘
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s) which
surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational
efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on
vessels of all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their
service, and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an
underwriter that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Society of Lloyd’s.
Shipowners' Organisations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
362
Steamship Owners’ Association. The General Council of British Shipping co-ordinates
the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all matters of major policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners’ Association, the London General
Shipowners’ Society, and the North of England Shipowners’ Association. Others represent
companies specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.
Employers’ Organisations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers’ Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations and the regula¬
tion of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the
administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which
shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons and above engage them through
the Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to offer
two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation is also responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the National Sea Training Schools set up for the
purpose of training ratings for the deck and catering departments and as firemen.
Seafarers’ Organisations
Shipmasters are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association’, navi¬
gating officers, engineer officers, apprentices, cadets, pursers and ships’ surgeons by
the Merchant Navy and Airline Officers’ Association] and radio officers by the Radio
Officers’ Union. Some uncertificated engineer officers are represented by the Amalga¬
mated Engineering Union. The interests of the deck, engine-room and catering ratings
are represented by the National Union of Seamen.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrangement,
National Maritime Board agreements do not apply to vessels of under 200 gross tons,
or to certain other ships, including tugs and salvage vessels. Detailed working of the
board is carried on by a number of ‘panels’ representing the various interests of those
forming the seafarers’ part of the board.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other and
with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series of
‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates, and to maintain
frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a conference is the
establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares from each port of
departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review and revise existing rates,
or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or
have joined together to form wider groupings.
The Baltic Exchange
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of London’s
seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market for the chartering of
ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’ representatives meet here to
arrange the chartering of ships, or space in ships, for the carriage of all kinds of goodt
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
363
to and from all parts of the world. Other classes of business transacted on the Baltic
Exchange include the chartering of air transport (see p. 387) and the purchase and
sale of grain and oilseeds.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The Ministry of Transport is the Government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894
and subsequent legislation it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare,
for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that ensures that a ship is not
overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship construction;
ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment;
and dealing with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of
seamen. Most of the work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the officers
of the Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is also a Registrar-
General of Shipping and Seamen in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all
British ships and seamen is kept. The ministry is represented on the Merchant Navy
Welfare Board (see p. 365) and on the Merchant Navy Training Board (see p. 364).
The ministry fosters the development and use of modern navigational aids.
The ministry is responsible for transporting by sea the men and materials of the
armed forces and looks after ships that it owns or has chartered. It is concerned with
general shipping policy and the strategic implications of the Merchant Navy; and it is
also the sponsoring department for the shipbuilding, ship repairing and marine
engineering industries.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those provisions
dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the United Kingdom,
are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of the Commonwealth and
Colonial Governments.
The United Kingdom is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention
of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations which
have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets from discharging
oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in extensive areas of the Atlantic Ocean and
the North Sea. British ships registered in the United Kingdom were already prohibited
from discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around the United Kingdom
under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, i955> which is administered by the Ministry
of Transport. The discharge of oil from any source into United Kingdom territorial
waters and harbours was first prohibited in 1922.
Lighthouses, Pilotage and Rescue
The Ministry of Transport administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily
a life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast for
vessels in distress and renders assistance either by rocket life-saving apparatus or by
informing other authorities who may be able to give help. There is close liaison
between the Coastguard Service and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The latter
maintains lifeboats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is supported entirely
by voluntary subscriptions, and depends largely for its operation on voluntary workers.
From its foundation in 1824 to the end of i959> R°yal National Lifeboat Institution
rescued 82,474 people. Lifeboats were launched 866 times in i959> an<^ rescued 551
people; on nearly 1,200 occasions in the twelve months to March i960, life-saving
action was taken by the Coastguard Service.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
364
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first Royal
Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board of ten Elder Brethren
elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. It is also the chief pilotage
authority in the United Kingdom, licensing some 600 pilots in 41 districts in England
and Wales, including London. In some cases the harbour authority is the pilotage
authority. Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of
the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.
The Ministry of Transport also has certain responsibilities in connection with light¬
houses and pilotage.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
The number of masters, officers and men serving in 1959 in British ships on articles
of agreement opened or closed in the United Kingdom was about 141,000.
Training
Nautical training in the United Kingdom has tw'o distinct objectives: first, to give
intending entrants into the Merchant Navy an introductory training before going
to sea—this is commonly known as ‘pre-sea training’—and secondly, to prepare
those who have already performed the requisite sea-service, qualifying them for
admission to the examinations, for the various statutory and other certificates granted
by the Ministry of Transport. Pre-sea training is not compulsory for those who go to
sea as apprentices or cadets but most shipping companies will, in practice, accept
only those who have undergone such a course. There are a number of residential and
non-residential training establishments.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies at sea
of apprentices and cadets who are preparing for their examinations for certificates
of competency as second mate.
The Ministry of Transport holds examinations for, and issues certificates of com¬
petency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of foreign-going
ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first class engineer and second
class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships in these grades unless
they hold the appropriate, or a higher certificate.
Sea-going engineer officers usually receive their basic training in engineering by
serving a suitable apprenticeship of not less than four years in engineering work¬
shops ashore, although part of this period may be spent at approved courses in mechanical
engineering. An alternative scheme of training has been introduced, however, under
which shipping companies themselves select apprentices for a special course of training
consisting of a two-year diploma course in a technical college, followed by eighteen
months’ training at sea and finally twelve months’ training in an engineering work¬
shop ashore. Sea-going engineer officers are first employed as junior engineers:
they become eligible to take examinations for second and first class certificates of
competency after performing periods of qualifying sea-service.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio telegraphy
issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open examination.
All boys who wish to join the Merchant Navy as deck or junior catering ratings must
undergo a course of pre-sea training. The majority receive their training at the National
Sea Training Schools but courses are also provided by certain private organisations
and by a number of local education authorities.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered

ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate a seaman must,
among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on deck, have obtained a
certificate of proficiency as lifeboatman and have passed a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a second
mate’s certificate.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers and
ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, introduced by
the board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty formerly associated
with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year contracts, not only with
individual shipping companies but with the industry as a whole, and get special
benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance benefit wffien they are
ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and seamen’s
unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries of Transport,
Labour and Pensions and National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been respon¬
sible since 1948 for the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant
seamen in the United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. The eleven largest are shown
in Table 24, which lists them in order of tonnage of shipping arriving and departing
and does not relate to the volume of cargo handled. Most ports, other than those
owned by the British Transport Commission, are represented on the Dock and Harbour
Authorities' Association, formed in 19 W represent the common interests of port
authorities in their relations with Government, shipowners and traders.
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway, over 2,000 acres of dock estate
and 43 miles of quays, is the largest port in the Commonwealth, and with New York
and Rotterdam is one of the three largest ports in the world. Goods of every kind, from
meat to marble, from plywood to perfume, pass through the docks; in the year which
ended on 31st March, 1959, 52 million tons of cargo were handled. Imports are distri¬
buted all over the United Kingdom, though the port supplies, primarily, Greater
London and the home counties. In April i959> an information service, installed at a
cost of nearly ^80,000, was opened at Gravesend to assist ships masters entering the
river Thames.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of the United
Kingdom. The port handles one-fifth of Britain’s grain imports, and has one of the
largest grain-handling plants in Europe. There are tobacco warehouses with a capacity
of 70,000 casks, and for wool imports, a warehouse with a capacity of 30,000 bales.
Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship Canal.
Petroleum is both the main import and the main export. At Eastham is the largest oil
dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton, largest of the Channel ports, is the chief port for ocean passenger
traffic, and the principal port for imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton s

value as a port is enhanced by its double tides and its easy access to London. A
considerable volume of oil for the refinery at Fawley (see p. 368) is handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north-east of
England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship repairing
centre in the country.

Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of Yorkshire
and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in the world.
Middlesbrough is the largest iron-ore port in Britain, and exports mainly steel and
engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As well
as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate neighbour¬
hood, but its rapidly increasing importance derives largely from the oil which it
imports and exports for local refineries.
Bristol and nearby Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the city of
Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 7 million tons of cargo are
handled annually, including one-third of Britain’s banana imports and a quarter of its
tobacco imports. There are also extensive oil installations.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the industrial
area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of Scotch whisky.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and the main i
export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main traffic across
the Irish Sea.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
367
Ownership
The ports, in some cases docks only, previously owned by the main-line railway
companies are now under public ownership and are administered by the British
Transport Commission (see p. 369). The commission owns and manages, through
British Transport Docks Division, some 30 per cent of Britain’s dock accommodation,
with a total of over half a million feet of quays. A few of the commission’s ports are
docks developed by former canal undertakings, such as the Aire and Calder Navigation
which developed Goole. The rest are those formerly owned by the railways. In some
cases—e.g., at Southampton and Middlesbrough—the railways owned the main docks
in ports where the statutory authority was a harbour board. In other cases—e.g., at
Grangemouth, Garston and Grimsby—the port was largely developed by the railway
company which was itself the statutory harbour authority. Some railway-owned ports
were, and still are, mainly used for the railways’ cross-Channel services: Folkestone,
Harwich, Newhaven, Fishguard, Holyhead, and Heysham are in this category.
Among other ports owned by the commission are Hull, Swansea, Newport, and Cardiff.
In 1959, shipping arrivals and departures at the commission’s docks, harbours and
wharves, at which 20,000 were employed at the end of that year, totalled over 101
million net tons, and the total cargo handled was about 56 million tons.
Other ports are controlled by a public trust on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies such
as Government departments and local authorities. Examples are London (controlled
by the Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation Trust),
the Port of London Authority has 28 members, nominated by Government departments,
local authorities, port users and the Corporation of Trinity House. A few ports
Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town or city council and
controlled entirely by a committee of the council. Finally, there are about 100 ports
which are privately owned. Manchester is the only major port so owned by the
Manchester Ship Canal Company—and here the Manchester City Council exercises
considerable control by appointing 11 of the company s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set own
in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with many of the detai s
is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Act, 1847.
Labour
There are about 140,000 people employed in the operation of ports in the United
Kingdom. Just under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff,
and pilots, lightermen and customs officials. Over half are the dock workers (popularly
called ‘dockers’) who do the physical handling of cargo. . .
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, wi
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casua a our unti I941’
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers o emp oyers
and workers. The war-time arrangements were superseded in 1947 by a permanen
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board, whic consists o a c airman,
vice-chairman, and eight members appointed by the Minister o a our, our
represent employers and four to represent employees. Workers on the board s registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage for attendance, even when there is no work
available. The National Joint Council for the Port Transport Industry has agree o a
pension scheme which, it was hoped, would come into operation at t e en o 190.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Tanker Terminals
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude oil are
berthed at special tanker terminals near the oil refineries which are owned and operated
by the oil companies. The deadweight tonnage capacity of some of the most important
terminals is: Finnart (on the Firth of Clyde) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames estuary)
42,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Canvey Island (London) 21,000; Coryton
(London) 45,000; Thameshaven (London) 60,000; Tilbury Reach (London) 47,000;
Eastham (Manchester) 32,000; Milford Haven 100,000; Fawley (Southampton)
65,000; and Swansea 20,000. The terminal at Finnart was the first in Europe capable of
handling fully loaded tankers of 100,000 tons deadweight at any time; a 57-mile
pipeline connects the terminal to the refinery at Grangemouth, on the Firth of Forth.
A new terminal was opened at Tranmere, on Merseyside, in June i960 and one at
Milford Haven, in south-west Wales, will be completed shortly. At Cardiff and
at Granton, on the Firth of Forth, new terminals are planned, each costing
£500,000.
The capacity of existing terminals on the Thames and at Southampton is also to be
increased by dredging. As some of the larger existing tanker terminals are unable to
berth fully laden oil tankers of more than 32,000 d.w.t., these new projects have
assumed greater importance in handling the largest tankers.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly by road
and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland waterways play
an important part in carrying freight, particularly bulk cargoes.
In 1959, the number of passenger journeys made by public transport (road and
rail) in Great Britain was 15,500 million, of which 1,600 million were made on British
Railways and London Transport railways. In addition, in the summer of i960, some
5 million motor cars and if million motor cycles (including about half a million scooters)
were licensed for use on the roads. The average annual mileage of most of the cars is
estimated to be between five and ten thousand. Journeys by public transport are mainly
short and a great many of them are to and from places of work. The resultant concen¬
tration of travel in the morning and evening ‘rush hours’ constitutes a formidable
problem in London and other large centres of population.
A general picture of the domestic goods transport system in Great Britain is provided
by the results of a sample survey of goods transport by road made in April 1958 by
the Ministry of Transport, the first such survey for six years. According to this survey,
76 per cent of the total tonnage carried in 1958 (estimated at 1,320 million tons) went
by road, while in terms of ton-mileage2 the proportion was 45 per cent. The railways
accounted for 19 per cent of all tonnage carried and 35 per cent of ton-mileage. The
proportions for coastal shipping were 4 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, and
for inland waterways 1 per cent of the total tonnage. Although the volume of goods
transported by the railways in 1958 was reduced considerably by the fall in demand
for coal and for iron and steel, the survey affirmed that it was clear that, whatever
unit of measurement was used, road transport was now the major means of inland
carriage of goods. The 1952 survey had shown that the railways were responsible in
that year for 43 per cent of the ton-mileage and road transport for 37 per cent.
1 For an account of inland transport in Northern Ireland, see p. 380.
2 Ton-mileage is calculated by multiplying the tonnage carried by the actual distance it was
transported.

THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION
Today the British Transport Commission has an annual turnover of ^730 million
and is the largest single employer of labour in the country, employing some 736,000.
Its present role and structure are the result of the Transport Act, 1947, and
subsequent Acts.
The Transport Acts of 1947,1953 and 1956
On 1st January, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act
of 1947, most of Great Britain’s inland transport system passed into public ownership.
On that date, the railways, all railway-owned steamships, docks, hotel and road
transport interests, most of the country’s canals (including all those owned by the
railways) and the whole of London’s passenger transport system came under the control
of the British Transport Commission, a newly created public authority, which was
given the duty of providing an efficient, adequate and integrated system of public
inland transport and port facilities for passengers and goods. In addition, the com¬
mission was to arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance
road haulage firms. Road passenger transport outside London was not taken over, but
the commission was given powers to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger
services by road and rail, including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for
this purpose. A considerable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many
docks were left outside the commission’s scope.
The Conservative Government which took office in 1951 announced a new policy
for the operation of public transport, including decentralisation of the railway
administration, greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice (particularly
in charging), the partial return of long-distance road haulage to private enterprise,
and the revocation of the commission’s power to make schemes for the co-ordination
of road and rail passenger services. The policy was put into effect by the Transport
Act of 1953, and the actual reorganisation of the British Transport Commission was
completed by 1st January, 1955. A further Act, the Transport (Disposal of Road
Haulage Property) Act, 1956, brought to an end the denationalisation of road haulage.
Today the British Transport Commission resembles in organisation, purpose and
status a large-scale commercial corporation. It is in keen competition with public
and private transport by road, sea and air.
Present Organisation
Under the 1947 Act, the British Transport Commission is responsible to the
Minister of Transport who, in turn, is responsible to Parliament. The minister appoints
the members of the commission (with the maximum membership of 14 members
and a chairman) and is empowered to give general directions to the commission in
the national interest and to approve the outline of programmes of major development
and of training, education and research.
The commission itself is a policy-making and not a managing body. It works
through six policy-making committees,1 each dealing with one particular subject
in relation to all the commission’s activities, and through sub-commissions1 which
are not policy-making but each of which takes a special interest in the activities of
one of the seven divisions which carry on the various activities of the commission.
1 These committees and sub-commissions are mainly composed of members of the British
Transport Commission.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
370
These seven divisions are: British Railways, British Road Services, Tilling (bus)
Group, Scottish Omnibus Group, British Transport Docks, British Waterways,
and British Transport Hotels and Catering Services.
In the London area, road passenger transport and the underground railways are
operated by the London Transport Executive (see p. 379), which was established as
an agent of the British Transport Commission by the Transport Act, 1947.
Consultation with coastal shipping operators is provided by the Coastal Shipping
Advisory Committee, which was set up under the 1947 Act to consider, and from time
to time to report to the minister on, all matters jointly affecting the interests of the
British Transport Commission and those of coastal shipping. The 1953 Act extended
the scope of the committee’s work to include road haulage. The members of this
committee are appointed by the minister from the commission and from among
representatives of coastal shipping, after consultation with interests concerned. The
commission also consults with the operators of coastal liners on questions of rates and
charges at the Coasting Liner Conference.
In April i960, the Minister of Transport appointed an advisory body to examine the
structure, finance and working of the British Transport Commission in the light of
the Government’s proposals for an extensive reorganisation of the Commission,
announced by the Prime Minister in March i960.
Finance
An annual report and statement of accounts is submitted to the minister, who
lays it before Parliament. The British Transport Commission is under obligation
to cover its outgoings, taking one year with another, but during the present period of
railway modernisation it is permitted to carry forward the deficits arising on British
Railways. For the four years 1956-59 the accumulated deficit was £300 million.
For the calendar year 1959 the deficit was some £74 million, including interest
on British Transport stock; of this, £42 million represented an operating loss on the
railways. The commission hopes that the various corrective measures that it has
in hand, particularly projects that will be completed early in the railway modernisation
programme, will bring the financial position into approximate balance by 1963 or
1964. Meanwhile, in order to meet financial needs during the critical years of recon¬
struction, the Government, under the Transport (Railway Finances) Act, 1957,
and the Transport (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959, is making special advances to
the commission of up to £400 million to meet the annual revenue deficits for this
limited period. The advances made are liable to interest and will be repaid in instal¬
ments. The commission’s ordinary borrowing powers (i.e. excluding those to meet
deficits) are limited to £1,200 million. Further changes in the arrangements for both
short and long-term finance are at present under consideration.
Gross receipts from the commission’s principal carrying activities in 1959 were:
passenger traffic, £288 million; freight traffic, £368 million; and miscellaneous,
£16 million. In addition, gross receipts from other principal activities amounted to
£55 million. Interest on British Transport Stock and other interest charges amounted
to £83 million. Fixed assets at the end of 1959 were valued at £1,857 million, of which
£1,621 million related to British Railways.
Transport Tribunal
The Transport Tribunal, set up under the 1947 Act, has jurisdiction over the charges
schemes which govern the maximum charges which the British Transport Commission
may make on British Railways, on the road and rail services provided by the London
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
371
Transport Executive, at its docks, and by tolls for the use of inland waterways. The
Transport Tribunal replaced the Railways Rates Tribunal and has also taken over
responsibilities from certain other statutory bodies. Appeals arising from applications
for road haulage (goods vehicles) licences are heard by the tribunal and it has other
duties relating to harbours and canals.
Transport Users* Consultative Committees
There are eleven Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committees and a Central
Transport Consultative Committee for Great Britain, which were set up, under the
1947 Act, to give transport users an opportunity of putting forward criticisms and
suggestions for improving the commission’s transport services. The members of
these committees are appointed by the Minister of Transport (after consultation with
the various organisations concerned) to represent commerce, industry, agriculture,
labour, local authorities and the British Transport Commission itself. The conclusions
of the nine area committees in England are subject to confirmation by the Central
Committee, which reports its findings to the Minister of Transport and the British
Transport Commission. If the Central Committee makes a formal recommendation
to the minister he may, if he thinks fit, give a direction to the commission on the matter
and the commission must give effect to it. The Scottish and Welsh area committees
send their conclusions directly to the minister. Matters dealt with include the British
Transport Commission’s proposals for closing branch railway lines, withdrawing
passenger train services and closing stations, and complaints by the public of
inadequacy of services or facilities.
RAILWAYS
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when George
Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century of widespread
railway development. The great period of railway building was from 1840 to 1875)
with a short lull following the collapse of the speculative railway boom, in 1846.
In the same year, an Act of Parliament prescribed a standard gauge of 4 feet 8£ inches
for all new railway lines except extensions of the Great Western Railway, which then
had a gauge of 7 feet and was not converted to the standard gauge until much
later. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888 drew up a standard freight
classification and schedules of maximum freight charges which came into operation
in 1893.
During the first world war, the railways came under centralised Government
direction through a Railway Executive Committee. This experience emphasised
the need for concentration and a reorganisation of the whole rail system. The Railways
Act of 1921 amalgamated 123 private companies into four large groups, the Lon on,
Midland and Scottish; London and North Eastern; Great Western; and Southern.
In the 1920s and 1930s the railways suffered from the prolonged industrial depression
and the growing competition from road transport. The causes of road competition were
twofold: first, motor transport often offered cheaper and better facilities; secondly,
the statutory regulation of the railways’ charging system resulted in the loss of some
lucrative traffic and the forced retention of unprofitable traffic.
In 1938, the railways made proposals for relief from statutory regulation of charges,
but the outbreak of war in 1939 postponed action and the railways again became
controlled by the Government.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Organisation under Public Ownership
The Transport Act of 1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a
single enterprise; British Railways, grouped in six regional sub-divisions, operated
under the overall management of a Railway Executive established as the agent of the
British Transport Commission.
The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and provided for a
reorganisation of the administration. The operation of British Railways is at present
in the hands of six area boards (the areas corresponding with the former regions),
which leave day-to-day management to the general managers of the areas. Important
matters affecting general policy are reserved to the British Transport Commission and
are dealt with by the British Railways Division and the Railways Sub-Commission.
Rolling Stock and Operations
British Railways operate about 19,000 route miles of permanent way with a total track
mileage of about 50,000 miles. Southern Region services alone carry annually almost
the same number of passengers as all the Class I railways of the United States of
America, although, of course, the average length of journey is much less. The urban
and suburban passenger commuting services for London and other large conurbations
carry about 2J million passengers a day, mainly to and from their work in brief rush
hour periods. These services account for about half the annual total of 1,100 million
passengers on British Railways. The railways are also indispensable to a great part of
the basic freight traffic. Every day British Railways haul a total of nearly 57 million
ton-miles of freight; the flexibility of their operations enables them to deal with sudden
heavy movements of bulk freight such as coal, or crops at harvest time. In 1959 British
Railways carried a total of 234 million tons of freight.
At the end of December 1959, the total staff of British Railways was 518,863,
including 258,608 operating staff. Locomotion was provided by 14,457 steam, 1,800
diesel of various types, and 85 electric engines. There were 31,450 locomotive-hauled
passenger carriages, 3,244 diesel multiple unit1 and 5,843 electric multiple unit1
carriages. British Railways also owned 34,356 road vehicles.
At the end of 1959, the British Transport Hotels and Catering Services owned
refreshment rooms at 345 stations, and also 38 hotels. At 82 of the stations, tenants
operated the refreshment facilities.
Development Plans
By the end of 1959 capital expenditure on British Railways in the twelve years since
the British Transport Commission came into operation, amounted to about ^820
million. Some of this was accounted for by renewals, including arrears inherited
from the past. The difficulties of the 1930s, the strain of the war years and the numerous
post-war claims on national resources had prevented any large schemes of railway
modernisation and the maintenance of an adequate replacement programme. This
past lack of investment is being remedied by a 15-year modernisation and re-equipment
plan, announced by the British Transport Commission in January 1955, which is
designed to transform virtually all the services offered by British Railways.
In July 1959, the cost of the plan was estimated to be £1,660 million, against £1,200
million in the original version. The revised plan envisaged a greater concentration
of expenditure, averaging about £190-210 million a year, in the years 1959-63. By
about the end of 1963 the British Transport Commission expects a working surplus of

between £50 million and j£ioo million a year, against which interest charges will
amount to about £85 million. The programme is being financed partly from internal
sources and partly by borrowings.
Major features of the programme include the re-modelling of passenger operations
to ensure fast, clean, regular and frequent services (electric or diesel) in all the great
urban areas, to accelerate inter-city and main-line trains and to provide economic
services on other routes. Freight services are being completely re-cast to increase
efficiency, for example, by means of express freight trains with vacuum brakes and
special services for export goods between manufacturing centres and the London docks.
By 1963, freight mileage will have been reduced by 15 per cent, and the wagon fleet
of 750,000 will be about a quarter fewer than in 1959.
The plan heralds the end of steam traction and aims at carrying out as much electri¬
fication as possible within the 15-year period. Electrification is going ahead much
faster than originally expected, chiefly due to the adoption of the 25kV a.c. system
a revolutionary change. The plan provides for electrifying the route from London
(Euston) to Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool by 1964, and later, the route
from London (King’s Cross) to Leeds; extending electrification from London
(Liverpool Street) as far as Ipswich and Harwich; extending the existing third rail
electrification system of the Southern Region east of a line from Portsmouth to Reading
and carrying out additional suburban electrification for London and Glasgow.
On other main lines, diesel locomotives are being introduced as rapidly as possible.
About 900 main-line diesel locomotives are expected to be in service by the end of
i960, and 1,200 by the middle of I96i> with a further 600 on order or authorised. It
was expected that some 4,000 multiple-unit diesel vehicles would be operating on branch
lines and stopping services by the end of i960.
A co-ordinated effort to improve the permanent way is being made in all regions.
As an example, on the Southern Region a magnetic track automatic warning system
is in use over 85 route miles as the first stage of a three-year scheme costing £500,000.
Big new marshalling yards, each of which takes over the functions of several smaller
yards, are being constructed: for example, the new Margam (South Wales) marshalling
yard, opened in April i960, is the most modern in Europe and can handle over 4,000
wagons a day. New or modernised freight depots are being built at Liverpool, Lincoln,
Barking and Peterborough. Some existing depots and marshalling yards and several
hundred small stations are being closed.
Passenger coaches of improved design and construction and with a better range
of amenities are being introduced. In i960, five diesel-electric de luxe trains came
into operation on routes from London to Manchester, to Birmingham and
Wolverhampton, to Leicester and to Bristol. The plan has allocated some £55 million
for modernising some of the many passenger stations (there are over 5,000 stations in
Great Britain). Banbury, Barrow-in-Furness and Plymouth are examples of passenger
stations that have been or are being rebuilt. New signalling devices (including high-
intensity colour-light signals and automatic warning control) are being introduced
to increase safety on the railways.
ROADS
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to set up a
central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established by the Develop¬
ment and Road Improvement Funds Act of 1909. In 1919, the board’s responsibilities
were taken over by the newly established Ministry of Transport.
374
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1959, Great Britain had 193,072 miles of public highway, over two miles for every
square mile of territory. There were 8,334 miles of trunk roads, 19,735 miles of Class I
roads, 17,595 miles of Class II roads, 48,875 miles of Class III roads and 98,533
miles’of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic value, those
of purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. On maps and signposts the
trunk and Class I roads can usually be indentified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route
number, and Class II roads by the letter ‘B\ Trunk roads are the mam arteries of
national’traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The
Minister of Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and Wales
and on these roads he administers expenditure, which is provided wholly from central
Government sources, although for many purposes he employs local authorities as his
agents. The highway authority for Class I, Class II and Class III roads is, in general,
the council of the county or county borough in whose area the road lies. The minister
makes grants towards approved expenditure on construction and maintenance of
these roads at the rate of 75, 60 or 50 per cent according to the class of road. The
Secretary of State for Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland.
Unclassified roads are entirely the responsibility of the local authority in whose area
they lie.
Development
While it was impossible in the years immediately following the second world war
to spend much more on the roads than was required for their essential maintenance, a
large road-building programme has now been undertaken. Central Government
expenditure on new construction and major improvements has been rising steadily
over the past few years: for the whole of Great Britain in the year which ended with
March 1959 it was £50-5 million, while in the year 1959-60 it was £64 million and in
the year 1960-61 it is expected to be £75-5 million. The current programme includes
Britain’s first motorways constructed for the use of limited classes of traffic under the
powers granted to the ministers by the Special Roads Act, 1949 (now consolidated in
the Highways Act, 1959). , . ., . .
These motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national net¬
work of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this programme will
eliminate the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and thus give free outlets from the big
cities and from other main sources of traffic to the trunk routes, while smaller road¬
works will be undertaken to the maximum possible extent all over the country. Priority
is being given to five major routes: a trunk road from London to Newcastle, based on
the Great North Road; a motor road from London to Birmingham and thence to the
north-west; roads from London to the south-east by-passing the Medway towns and
Maidstone and Ashford; a road from the industrial Midlands to the South Wales
ports; and a road from London westwards to London Airport, the west of England
and South Wales. In Scotland, the programme includes the reconstruction of the
Glasgow to Stirling and Glasgow to Carlisle trunk roads. Dual carriageways for about
two-thirds of the length of the Great North Road are completed or under construction.
The London-Birmingham motorway was opened in November 1959. Progress has
been made on two connecting stretches of the motor way from the Midlands to
South Wales: the 20-mile Ross Spur was ready in the autumn of i960 and work started
early in i960 on the 12^-mile stretch between Birmingham and Worcester. In the
summer of i960 the Maidstone by-pass on the London to Folkestone trunk road was
completed. By-passes at Lancaster and Preston built to motorway standard will form
part of the 110-mile motorway from Birmingham to Lancaster, and work is starting on

other sections of the road. The £11 million Dartford-Purfleet road tunnel under the

began in May i960 on a £6 million scheme which will improve traffic flow at Hyde
Park Corner, the busiest road junction in the capital.
In Scotland, the building of the Whiteinch tunnel under the river Clyde, at a cost
°f j£6-4 million, began in 1957 and is due to be completed in 1962; a twin tunnel,
authorised in 1959, is due to be completed in 1963 at a cost of £3-4 million. The
construction of a new road bridge across the Firth of Forth began in 1958 and is
expected to be completed in 1963, at an estimated cost of £16 million. It is to be
followed by a road bridge across the Firth of Tay.
ROAD TRANSPORT
In 1959, there were 8-6 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great Britain’s
roads. Of these, 1-3 million were goods vehicles and 93,000 were public road passenger
vehicles (i.e. buses, trolleybuses, trams and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles, and
road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the railways. The
first step towards Government regulation of public road transport was the passing
of the London Traffic Act of 1924, which gave the Minister of Transport power to
control the number of buses and their journeys in London; this was followed, in 1933,
by the setting up of the London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 379). In 1928, a
Royal Commission was appointed to examine the problems that had arisen out of the
growth of motor traffic. The recommendations of this commission led to the introduction
of further legislation.
The Road Traffic Act, 1930, ended the licensing of public service (i.e. passenger)
vehicles by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas, of which there are now
eleven, covering the whole country and each under the control of three traffic com¬
missioners (except for the London metropolitan area which has one) appointed by
the minister. The commissioners regulate, by means of a licensing system, all public
road passenger transport services, and sanction routes and time-tables in order to
secure proper co-ordination of services and to eliminate unnecessary competition;
they also control fares. Competing operators and local authorities are entitled to raise
objections concerning applications to the commissioners for new licences or the renewal
of existing licences.
Organisation of Road Haulage
The Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, based upon the recommendations of the Royal
Commission and of an experts’ report (the Salter Report) of 1932, established a
system of licensing for road haulage vehicles, which is still in operation, designed
to restrict vehicle operations to approved needs and to eliminate wasteful competition.
A licence has to be secured from the licensing authority (who is, in fact, the chairman
of the appropriate body of traffic commissioners) before a goods vehicle can be used
on the road. There are three types of licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage;
the ‘B’ licence for public haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering
also the carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by
traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are examined
by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary in view of existing transport
services already available, and competitors may raise objections. There is a right of
appeal to the Transport Tribunal against the decision of the licensing authorities. The
N
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
376
‘C’ licence is granted on application, as of right. All goods vehicle operators are bound
by regulations concerning the fitness and loading of vehicles, the keeping of records
and the pay and hours of their employees.
Under the Transport Act of 1947, the British Transport Commission took over
‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage. Vehicles
operating under ‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialised traffic
were not affected by the Act. After the change of Government in 1951, the Transport
Act of 1953 required the commission to dispose of the bulk of its road haulage under¬
taking. In 1956, this process was halted by the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Property) Act, which enabled the commission to retain under its control more vehicles
than were permitted under the 1953 Act. Altogether, the commission disposed of 20,000
vehicles. Since September 1956, British Road Services (BRS) have been conducting
their business through the medium of five companies which together own about 16,000
vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general haulage); BRS (Pickfords) Ltd. (special
traffic and some contracts); BRS (Contracts) Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd., and BRS
(Meat Haulage) Ltd. The shares of all these companies are owned by the British
Transport Commission; those of BRS (Parcels) Ltd. and BRS (Meat Haidage) Ltd.
are still subject to disposal at some later date. All the commission’s vehicles are subject
to the licensing system.
The road haulage industry consists of about 1-3 million licensed vehicles, and of
these some 1 • 1 million are operated under a ‘C’ licence by 600,000 carriers, for their
own goods. Of the other 200,000 vehicles, with ‘A’ and ‘B licences, about 15,000 are
operated by British Road Services and the rest are operated by some 45,000 hauliers.
There are only a few operators with large fleets of vehicles in any of the licence categories.
‘C’ licence vehicles include a large number of small vehicles used locally in the delivery
of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles in this class are engaged in long-distance
haulage of traders’ own goods. A sample survey made by the Traders Road Transport
Association in 1958 indicated that ‘C’ licence operators with fleets of over 100 vehicles
were probably fewer than 3 per cent of the total number of operators, but accounted
for over half the ‘C’ licence vehicles in use in the country.
Public Passenger Transport by Road
Local authorities own and operate over ninety urban bus systems (but not that of
London). The largest of these is in Glasgow, where 611 trams and 1,329 buses and
trolleybuses carried some 552 million passengers in 1959. Birmingham city transport
system carried 454 million passengers in 1959 and the Manchester system about 411
million. (London Transport Executive’s operations are described on p. 379.)
The bus services throughout the country are operated by some 4,736 local concerns,
nearly all of which belong to three main groups—British Electric Traction, the Filling
Group and Scottish Omnibuses. Tilling’s and Scottish Omnibuses are owned by the
British Transport Commission; British Electric Traction is a private concern, the
commission having substantial shareholdings in a number of companies in this group,
but no controlling interest.
Road Safety Measures
Britain has the highest density of traffic in the world, giving rise to pressing problems
of road safety. In 1959, 6,520 people were killed on the roads and 32^>933 injure^‘
This compares with 7,343 persons killed and 231,603 injured in i934> when there were
only 2^ million motor vehicles on the roads—an indication that the problem has, to
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
377
some extent, been held in check by road safety measures introduced under the Road
Traffic Acts of 1934 an<^ Among these are a speed limit of 30 miles an hour in
built up areas, modified later by the introduction of a 40 m.p.h. limit on certain
main roads on the outskirts of London and an experimental 30 m.p.h. limit on certain
roads in the summer of i960; the requirement that all new drivers must pass a driving
test; the provision of pedestrian crossings, including some illuminated by flashing
beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes (zebra crossings); and a new system
of road markings, including double white lines at dangerous bends, to keep traffic to
its own side of the road and prohibit parking.
All drivers of motor vehicles—including motor cycles, motor scooters and powered
pedal cycles have to pass a driving test before being granted a substantive licence to
drive1; until they pass the test they must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates
their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates and, in all cases where vehicles are constructed
to carry passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied
by a qualified driver. By regulations now in force, made under the Road Traffic
Act, i960, private motor cars, motor cycles and goods vehicles up to 30 cwt. unladen
weight which are ten years old or more must be submitted for an annual test, at an
approved testing station, of the condition of their brakes, steering gear and lighting
equipment. Vehicles of these types may not legally be used on public roads after
specified dates without a valid test certificate. It is expected that regulations will
be made during 1961, under which the grant of a licence permitting a vehicle to
be used on the roads will, in appropriate cases, be conditional on the production of a
valid test certificate.
In addition, vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authorities
with the aid of Government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,
which acts as the Government’s agent in this connection, assists and co-ordinates
these campaigns. The police and education authorities are actively at work in the
cause of road safety. The standard of conduct for all road users—pedestrians and drivers
—is set out in the Highway Code. A failure to observe the code does not of itself render
a person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any such
proceedings.
The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act, i960, permits the employment of
traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for fixed penalties (the
‘ Ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the Act, designed to reduce
traffic congestion, include the granting of greater powers of action to the Minister of
Transport within London and to local traffic authorities in other areas. In London,
and in some other local authority areas, parking meters have been introduced to
regulate the length of time vehicles are parked; and increased off-street parking facilities
are being provided. Several extensive schemes for the improvement of road safety
and the relief of traffic congestion are being undertaken: these include ‘fly-overs’
at road junctions; new outlet roads from cities; and, as an experiment, the designation
of certain stretches of trunk roads as ‘clearways’, on which waiting on the carriageway
is (with certain exceptions) prohibited.
In February i960, a London Traffic Management Unit was established, charged
with securing the maximum use of London’s streets as traffic arteries by applying
modern traffic engineering techniques.

INLAND WATERWAYS
In 1761, James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This marked
the beginning of canal building in modern Britain which played an important part
in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. As railway competition developed, about one-third of the canal
mileage passed to the control of the railways. During the first world war, Government
control of railways included railway-owned canals and, under the Transport Act,
1947, most of the country’s canals passed from Government control, which had been
re-established in the second world war, to that of the British Transport Commission
in January 1948.
The System
There are some 2,600 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain, some
2,150 miles of which now belong to the British Transport Commission, the remainder
is still in the hands of local authorities or private companies. About 1,000 miles of the
commission’s canals are narrow waterways which can generally be used only by boats
not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load varying from 25 to 30 tons;
the remainder are broad waterways and canalised rivers which can be used by craft of
up to 400 tons capacity. The canals in Scotland are all broad waterways.
Of the 2,170 miles of inland waterways which originally came under the control
of the British Transport Commission, 283 miles have been closed to navigation or
abandoned, leaving 1,887 miles sti11 0Pen> of which 1’338 miles are in commercial
use. Since 1955, the canals have been managed separately by the waterways division
of the commission, known as British Waterways. For administrative purposes the
canals in England and Wales are grouped into four divisions, based on the main navigable
river estuaries, each group under a divisional manager. In Scotland, the Caledonian
Canal and the Crinan Canal each have a separate manager, and the Forth and Clyde,
Monkland and Union Canals are grouped together under another manager.
In 1959, total traffic on British Waterways amounted to 9 million tons, of which 3-7
million tons were coal, 2-2 million tons liquids in bulk and 3-1 million tons general
cargo. Some three-quarters of the total traffic is carried on 325 miles of the broad
waterways, which are mainly canalised rivers.
Although British Waterways is the largest single operator, most of the traffic is
handled by independent carriers, or by traders in their own craft. The British Transport
Commission at the end of 1959 owned 19 tugs and 1,101 carrying craft with a carrying
capacity of 45,611 tons, including 189 power-driven craft with a carrying capacity
of 9,276 tons.
Development
Since assuming control, the British Transport Commission has strengthened
the commercial organisation; it has improved dredging methods and equipment,
brought better types of craft into service, established a research organisation and
undertaken various development works. Following the report, issued in i955> ^7 a
specially appointed Board of Survey, a comprehensive five-year development plan
was begun in 1956. Under this plan, nearly j£6 million is being invested in the improve¬
ment of navigation and the provision of modern equipment on the seven major
waterways that carry most of the traffic—the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Sheffield
and South Yorkshire navigation, the Trent Navigation, the river Lee, the river

Severn, the river Weaver, and the Grand Union Canal (on the stretch below
Berkhamsted). In addition, since 1955, British Waterways have spent over £750,000
in extending and improving warehousing and terminal facilities, building new traffic
craft and modernising existing vessels. Annual maintenance expenditure on the other
canals of commercial importance has increased from £582,000 in 1954 to over
£880,000 in 1959.
The future of the country’s system of inland waterways was the subject of a report
published in 1958 by a committee of inquiry appointed by the Minister of Transport.
Among the recommendations of this committee were proposals for the separation of
waterways no longer of commercial value from the rest and for their redevelopment
for other purposes. In February 1959, the Government drew attention to the extensive
legislation that would be needed if the main recommendations of the report were
adopted, and stated that its intention was to introduce experimental measures designed
to gain experience which would be of help in framing future legislation. The Govern¬
ment has, therefore, set up an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Committee to
consider and advise upon schemes for the redevelopment of inland waterways no
longer of commercial value.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from Charing
Cross, contains over 8 million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829 when
the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared in the London streets. The first regular
tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863, the first underground steam
railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing
it over. In 1870, the world’s first tube railway, the Tower Subway, was constructed
under the river Thames; it was cable-operated and ran for only a few months. In
1890, the first electric tube railway in the world was opened, the City and South London
line, and this was followed in 1900 by the Central London Railway, then followed the
electrification of the steam-operated underground lines. Meanwhile, horse-drawn
buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and electric trams.
Until 1933, there were many separate undertakings providing passenger transport
facilities in London, but in that year these were all vested in a single public
corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with the establishment
of the British Transport Commission, the London Transport Executive took over
control.
The London Transport Executive
The London Transport Executive, which consists of a chairman and seven members,
three of whom are part-time members, operates and manages, on behalf of the British
Transport Commission, all bus, coach and underground railway services in the
London area in conjunction with British Railways, which provide the main-line and
suburban railway services. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets are
privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the
metropolitan police.) London Transport’s operations extend beyond Greater London
to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known as the London Passenger Transport
Area) with a radius of about 25 miles from Charing Cross and with a population of
some 10 million. In 1959, 3,425 million passenger journeys were made on the London
Transport system.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
38°
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south, 32
miles from east to west, and 49 miles from north-west to east. The total length of
the railway over which London Transport trains operate is 259 miles, of which 90
miles are underground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, 17-J miles
long. London Transport trains serve 280 stations.
At the end of 1959, London Transport’s diesel buses and coaches travelled over
8,744 miles of roads, and trolleybuses (which are operated by electricity) over
421 miles.
To carry traffic over all this area, the London Transport Executive in December
1959 owned 4,050 railway cars, 7,273 buses and coaches and 1,070 trolleybuses.
The total staff employed at the end of 1959 was 77,460, of whom 10,710 were women.
Since 1945, all tramcars have been replaced by buses, and by 1962 all the trolley¬
buses will be replaced, after more than 20 years’ service, by diesel buses. The under¬
ground railways have been extended, and a new j£i million station linking two lines at
Netting Hill Gate was opened in March 1959. Since the beginning of 1958, the London
Transport Executive has placed orders worth over £20 million for new rolling stock, to
be completed by 1962 at the latest, and has undertaken £5 million worth of further track
improvement schemes, which should also be completed by 1962. These are part of a
general modernisation scheme for the Underground, on which over £30 million, includ¬
ing replacement of rolling stock, is expected to be spent in the four years to 1963.
Proposals are under consideration for a new tube railway, estimated to cost £55
million, between Victoria Station and Walthamstow, in north-east London.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NORTHERN IRELAND
With the exception of passenger transport in Belfast, which is provided by the
city corporation, public road passenger and freight transport and rail services within
Northern Ireland are provided by the Ulster Transport Authority, a public body
which was established under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948.
The road passenger section of the authority’s undertaking operates a wide network
of omnibus services and an extensive programme of coach tours. The road freight
section provides a comprehensive service for the carriage of merchandise of all
descriptions (including heavy indivisible loads and livestock) and can supply vehicles
under contract for the exclusive use of traders. A chain of first class hotels is also
owned and operated by the authority.
The following figures relate to the authority’s undertaking during the year ended
30th September, 1959; they cover mileage on the Great Northern Railway system
and the traffic on that system taken over by the Authority on 1st October, 1958.

Roads
On 31st March, 1959, there were 13,735 miles of public roads in Northern Ireland,
comprising 348 miles of trunk roads, 961 miles of Class I roads, 1,756 miles of Class II
roads, 2,867 miles of Class III roads and 7,803 miles of unclassified roads. The Ministry
of Commerce is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the trunk
roads and makes grants from the Road Fund (which is derived from such sources as
the proceeds of taxation of mechanically propelled vehicles registered in Northern
Ireland and from driving licence fees) to help the local authorities who are responsible
for the other roads. During the year ended 31st March, 1959, a total of £7 million was
spent on work on all types of public roads in Northern Ireland.
CIVIL AVIATION
United Kingdom civil air services are provided by the two public corporations,
British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA),
and by some eighteen independent air transport companies. The development of
United Kingdom civil air services since 1949 is shown in Table 25.
Growth of Air Services
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation
of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular mail and passenger
services, which were inaugurated on 25th August, 1919, when a daily passenger service
was opened between London (Hounslow) and Paris (Le Bourget). The year 1919 was
also marked by notable pioneer flights including the crossing of the Atlantic by John
Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June (both were later knighted for their achieve¬
ment) and the first flight between England and Australia by Captain (later Sir) Ross
Smith and his crew.
In April 1924, four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a Government grant of £1 million spread over the next ten
years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was represented on the board
of directors.
Imperial Airways Limited pioneered the commercial development of inter¬
continental air routes (including the organisation of ground services), following up,
in many cases, the exploratory work of the Royal Air Force. By 1929* there was a
through service from England to India. In 1931, the first service was established
to Central Africa. The first mail service to Australia started in December 1934,
followed by a passenger service in 1935- During a part of i939> Imperial Airways
operated an experimental transatlantic service for mail.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation (see p. 385),
was established by the British Overseas Airways Act, i939> an<I took over the under¬
takings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited in 1940. During
the second world war, BOAC operated essential overseas air services in support of the
war effort. By the end of the war, it was carrying more than twice as many passengers
as in 1939 and more than three times as much freight. The routes, moreover, had
efficient radio and radar systems which had been installed for war purposes and which
were adapted for civilian use.
After the war, British European Airways was established, under the Civil Aviation
Act, 1946, as a separate public corporation, to cover the United Kingdom and
Europe.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
382
The one serious obstacle to a continued expansion of British civil air transport after
1945 was the absence of any new British civil aircraft to replace the pre-war types.
Throughout the war the British aircraft industry had concentrated entirely on the
production of fighters and bombers for the Allied Forces, leaving the production
of transport aircraft to the United States. Although this was a period of rapid expansion
for the two corporations, it was the entry into service of the first jet powered aircraft,
and particularly the prop-jet Viscount, that brought about a faster rate of development
of civil aviation in the United Kingdom. The prop-jet Britannia, the return to regular
service of the pure-jet Comet and the Conway by-pass engines employed in the Boeing
707, have further enhanced the reputation of the United Kingdom aircraft industry
and British airlines.
The Role of the Government
Responsibility for the general development and expansion of United Kingdom civil
aviation, previously a function of the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, is
now vested in the Minister of Aviation, a new office created in the Government
reorganisation of October 1959. The Ministry of Aviation is also responsible for super¬
vising the development and production of civil aircraft and undertakes an extensive
programme of research and development to meet civil as well as Service needs. It also
issues ‘air operations’ certificates, which impose recognised standards of safety on all
commercial operators of air services.
In the international sphere, the Minister of Aviation is responsible for participation
in the work of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) of the United
Nations Organisation and, with the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations
Office, for dealings with other countries relating to civil aviation. He also advises the
Colonial Office on civil aviation matters.
The Government’s relations with the air corporations and with the independent
operators are described on p. 384. Three special bodies advise the minister in the
exercise of certain of his responsibilities: the Air Transport Licensing Board, the Air
Registration Board and the Air Safety Board.
The Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB)
The ATLB was established by the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960,
and consists of six to ten members appointed by the Minister of Aviation.
The board is responsible for granting licences to both the corporations and the
independent operators for the operation of air services. In granting licences the
Board takes into account an operator’s experience, financial resources, equipment,
organisation and staffing arrangements, and the adequacy of existing services. The
Board takes over some of the functions of the former Air Transport Advisory
Council and is an independent licensing authority, its decisions being subject to
appeal to the minister.
The Air Registration Board
The board was set up in 1937, and consists of 18 members, of whom 16 represent
the interests concerned with civil aviation and two are appointed by the minister. It is
an independent, non-profit-making limited company to which the minister has delegated
certain functions relating to the design, construction and maintenance of civil aircraft.
The work of the board includes the investigation, by its surveyors, of aircraft and
associated equipment for the purpose of making recommendations to the minister
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 383
concerning the issue and renewal of certificates of airworthiness. It also conducts the
technical examinations for the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers, flight
engineers and commercial pilots.
The Air Safety Board
The board is a standing advisory body of experts responsible to the minister for
keeping under continuous review the needs of safety in British civil aviation. It
recommends measures to increase safety and efficiency in the operation of British civil
an craft throughout the world and in the system of ground facilities provided for all
civil aircraft operating over the United Kingdom. In exercising his responsibility for
safety, the minister, advised by the board, regulates the operation of aircraft and the
conditions under which passengers and cargo may be carried, the licensing of flight
crews, the effectiveness of air traffic control and of navigational aids (see p. 388).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
384
Scheduled Services: Government Policy
Up to 1949, Government policy was that independent operators should undertake
charter work and the corporations should operate scheduled services. Starting in i949>
independent operators were permitted to operate certain scheduled services as
‘associates’ of the corporations. From 1952, the independent companies became
eligible to develop new routes and new types of scheduled services. The Air Transport
Advisory Council (ATAC), set up by the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, advised the minister
whether permission for these services could be given without materially diverting
traffic from existing services. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, i960, enables the
independent operators to apply on an equal basis with the corporations to the ATLB
for permission to operate scheduled services.
The Corporations: Powers and. Constitutions
The existing powers and constitutions of BOAC and BEA are laid down by the
Air Corporations Acts, 1949 to 1956. Each corporation consists of a chairman, deputy-
chairman and from 5 to 11 members, all of whom are appointed by the minister.
In the case of BOAC, the minister may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy-chairmen.
The annual reports and statements of accounts of the two corporations are laid
before Parliament by the minister. In addition, each corporation must submit, before
the beginning of every planning period (of three years), a programme of the services
it proposes to provide and of any other activities it intends to undertake, as well as
an estimate of its receipts and expenditure on revenue and capital account during
the period.
Finance
Each corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising temporary
loans or by issuing stock carrying a Treasury guarantee. In addition, the Finance
Act, 1956, permitted the corporations to raise money by means of interest-bearing
redeemable loans from the Exchequer, and these powers have been renewed each year
under the annual Finance Act. Under the Air Corporations Act, i960, the borrowing
powers of BOAC and BEA were raised to £180 million and £95 million respectively.
These limits are expected to meet the corporations’ requirements up to 31st
March, 1964.
Ministerial Control
Although the minister is empowered to give general directions on matters affecting
the national interest, for example, the placing of orders for aircraft, these powers are
very seldom used. The corporations function as commercial undertakings, but the
ministry is able to exert its influence by means of frequent but informal exchanges
of views. The minister also keeps in touch with the corporations regarding plans for
new aircraft and new routes, since he has to negotiate the necessary rights with foreign
governments. He also provides most of the aerodromes in the United Kingdom
from which the corporations operate, and the necessary navigational aids and
communications.
Labour Relations
In 1946, the National Joint Council for Civil Air Transport was set up as the body
through which terms and conditions of service between the corporations and the
various trade unions representing the employees are negotiated and matters affecting
safety, health, welfare and efficiency are discussed.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 385
Operations of the Corporations
The services, fleets and results of the two corporations in i960 are summarised below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation
BOAC operates scheduled services to all parts of the world. Its terminals in Australia
the Far East and Middle East are at Sydney, Melbourne, Tokyo, Hong Kong,’
Singapore, Karachi, Delhi, Bombay, Bahrain, Kuwait, Tehran and Aden; in Africa,
at Johannesburg, Nairobi, Accra and Lagos; in North America and the Caribbean,
at New York, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, Montreal and Jamaica; and in South
America, at Bogota, Caracas and Santiago, the service to South American cities
having been resumed, after an interval of six years, in January i960. There are regional
services between New York and Bermuda, Nassau and Jamaica (these services
operate as extensions of the London-New York route), and between Montreal and
Jamaica.
BOAC operates a number of services in close association with other airlines. Associate
arrangements exist between BOAC and Qantas Empire Airways, South African
Airways, Central African Airways Corporation, East African Airways Corporation,
Nigerian Airways, Ghana Airways, Middle East Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways,’
Air India International and Trans-Canada Airlines. In i959> BOAC inaugurated its
first round-the-world service. It was the world’s first such service operated completely
by jet-powered airliners.
This network of services is supplemented by the activities of subsidiary and associated
enterprises overseas in which BOAC participates financially or with which it has
technical or management agreements.
BOAC has a controlling financial interest in airlines operating in the southern
Red Sea area, the Caribbean and the Persian Gulf. It is associated, either financially
or through advisory and other agreements, with airlines providing services in East,
West and Central Africa, Malaya, the Far East, Borneo, Turkey, the Middle East,
and the Bahamas.
In common with other International Air Transport Association (IATA) members,
BOAC makes available two classes of service on its route network—first class, and
either tourist or economy class, according to the route. Additionally, it offers a still
lower fare class of service on certain routes between the United Kingdom and Colonial
Territories.
BOAC’s operational fleet in June i960 consisted of: 19 Mark 4 Comets-, 15 medium-
range Mark 102 Britannias; 17 long-range Mark 312 Britannias\ 10 DC yCs (only used
on non-scheduled services); and 5 Boeing joys. Orders for 10 Boeing yoys., 35
Vickers VCios and 10 Vickers Super VCios were outstanding.
BOAC has many pioneer achievements to its name: they include the world’s first
pure-jet air transport service between London and Johannesburg in May 1952 by
Comet /; the first airliner, the Bristol Britannia, to provide long-range prop-jet travel
(in 1957); and the introduction of the Comet 4 on the North Atlantic route in October
i958, the first transatlantic pure-jet aircraft.
On all its services in the financial year 1959-60, BOAC carried 591,000 passengers,
IO>3^5 short tons of freight and 4,349 short tons of mail, compared with 291,136
passengers, 6,756 tons of freight and 3,407 tons of mail in 1954-55.
In 1951-52, BOAC for the first time had a surplus amounting to £275,000, after
payment of interest on capital and before crediting the Exchequer grant of £1-5
million in that year. Since 1952-53, BOAC has operated without Exchequer grant.
From 1953-54 to I956~57, the annual surplus varied from £1 million to £117,000.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
386
In 1957-58 and 1958-59 deficits of £2-8 million and £5-2 million were incurred, due
to a series of temporary adverse factors. In 1959-60, the corporation itself had a surplus
of ^278,000 after payment of 3^4 rnillion in capital charges, reflecting both increased
traffic and the effects of the change over to turbo-jets; but in respect of its associated
airline companies BO AC incurred a deficit of j£i’2 million.
From 1954-55 to 1959-60, the capacity on BOAC services increased from 209
million to 433 million capacity-ton-miles, traffic revenue increased from £36-6 million
to £70-6 million, and operating costs were reduced from 39-6 pence per capacity-ton-
mile to 33-8 pence.
British European Airways
PEA is the seventh largest airline in the world and the largest in Europe, judged
by the annual number of passengers carried—3-29 million in the financial year 1959-60.
In that year it operated on its own behalf, in conjunction with its associated companies
and subsidiaries, a network of services covering 42,056 unduplicated route miles,
serving 84 airports in the United Kingdom, Europe, North Africa, and the Persian
Gulf, within a periphery on which the farthest points to the north, south, west and
east are Bergen, Doha, Lisbon and Moscow. Its services within the United Kingdom
include a number which cannot be operated commercially but which meet a vital social
need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Tourist fares
have been introduced on all BEA’s routes. BEA maintains a close working relationship
with BOAC, whose aircraft, by agreement, use a number of European stopping points.
BEA also co-operates with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities.
BEA’s operational fleet in June i960 comprised 6 Comet 48s, 24 Viscount jois, 21
Viscount 802s, 19 Viscount 806s, 29 Pionairs, 7 Pionair Leopard freighters, 2 Herons,
3 Rapides and 5 helicopters. At that date 20 Vanguards, 3 Comet 48s and 24 DH 121s
were on order.
The Viscount V 701 ‘Discovery’ class was brought into regular scheduled service
in April 1953, on the routes to Istanbul and Cyprus, thus inaugurating the world’s
first commercial operations with prop-jet aircraft. A larger version, the Viscount 802,
was brought into service in February 1957 between London and Paris. Since September
1958, practically all BEA’s international services have been operated by Viscounts.
The larger, more powerful and highly economical turbo-prop Vanguard entered into
service with the corporation in the autumn of i960. In April i960, BEA started turbo¬
jet services using Comet 4P airliners. These fast jet liners are to be followed by the
600 m.p.h. DH J2J jet airliners which are for delivery starting in 1963.
Experimental scheduled services with helicopters were carried out between 1950
and 1956. In i960, BEA applied for permission to operate services on internal routes
within Great Britain, and between London and Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris.
The first service will probably start in 1961. Two British helicopters the Westland
Westminster and Rotodyne—which may prove suitable for airline service within the
next few years, are being developed.
In addition to 3,289,606 passengers, BEA carried 36,395 short tons of freight and
7,848 short tons of mail in 1959-60. The figures in i954-55 were 1>874,3i6 passengers,
14,884 tons of freight and 6,964 tons of mail.
Over the period 1954-55 to 1959-60, BEA’s capacity increased from 98 million to
192 million capacity-ton-miles and operating revenue increased from £17-1 million
to £36-5 million.
In 1954-55, BEA achieved its first net profit, of £63,000. In i955~5^> ^ earned a net
profit of £603,614, which was sufficient to wipe out its accumulated deficit and leave
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 387
a surplus of £64,528, and it has earned a profit in every subsequent year. In 1959-60,
its profit totalled £2,086,078.
The Independent Airline Companies
In i960, there were about 20 independent airline companies. A merger of the two
largest companies took place early in i960, and other moves to establish larger units
are under consideration. Shipping lines have considerable, in some cases controlling,
interests in the more important companies. Most of the principal independent
companies are members of the British Independent Air Transport Association.
Because the air corporations were already operating services on all the major inter¬
national routes in 1952, most of the opportunities for the independent companies
to undertake scheduled services have been in the operation of secondary routes and the
provision of special types of services. The secondary routes on which the independent
companies provide passenger services at present consist mainly of domestic routes
and routes from United Kingdom provincial centres to Europe and the Channel
Islands. They also operate cheap regular services to certain points in the Colonies, and
to Ghana and Tunis. Other special services are vehicle ferry services from the United
Kingdom to Europe, inclusive holiday tour services to Europe and to Africa, and all¬
freight services, also to Europe and Africa. Some of the larger companies operate
subsidiaries in overseas countries and, in some cases, also provide management services
for foreign airlines.
Passenger traffic on the independent companies’ scheduled services has risen
from 122,000 in 1952 to 940,000 in 1959. The number of cars carried on the vehicle
ferry services has risen from 6,797 in I952 t0 85,000 in 1959.
Charter Services
The greater part of the independent companies’ operations still consist of general
charter work, notably air trooping which accounts for more than half the total passenger
miles flown by independent airlines on all operations, both scheduled and charter.
Other charter work includes the carrying of ships’ crews to and from overseas ports;
transporting the staff of public or private concerns operating overseas; taking parties
to football matches and race meetings in the British Isles; carrying livestock, machinery,
foodstuffs, flowers and other valuable, fragile or perishable cargo. There are also
several firms that specialise in other aerial activities, notably aerial survey and pest
control.
Much charter business is now arranged through the air section of the Baltic
Exchange, the London market for shipping space (see p. 362), where business from
any part of the world is handled between brokers representing the owners of aircraft
available for hire and the prospective shippers of cargo or organisers of passenger
trips. Inquiries for the charter of aircraft were first received on the Baltic Exchange
as long ago as 1925, but it was not until 1947 that an air section was formed. The
Airbrokers Association, formed in February i949> operates, in London, a world
market for chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers.
Aerodromes
The Minister of Aviation is authorised to establish and maintain civil aerodromes,
and so may local authorities, subject to his approval; there are also privately owned
aerodromes. All aerodromes, not operated by the Government, used for commercial
operations are subject to the minister’s licensing, inspection and regulation.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

There are approximately no civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 56 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 24 directly controlled by the ministry, 3 in the Channel Islands and
1 in the Isle of Man (administered by the local island governments) and 26 aerodromes
licensed for public use, of which 17 are owned by municipalities. Customs facilities
are provided at 12 of the ministry’s aerodromes and at 14 others.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in 1959-60 were:
for European services: London, Manchester (Ringway), Renfrew, and
Birmingham (Elmdon);
for North Atlantic services: London, Manchester (Ringway), and Prestwick;
for Middle East, African and Far East services: London.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aerodromes continue to increase.
In 1959, all United Kingdom civil aerodromes handled 8-3 million passengers.
Of this total, London Airport dealt with 4-1 million, and Gatwick, 370,000. Outside
the London area, Manchester (Ringway) handled the largest number, 566,000;
followed by Glasgow (Renfrew), 529,000; Belfast (Nutt’s Corner), 324,000; Ferryfield
(Kent), 262,000; Prestwick, 244,000; and Isle of Man (Ronaldsway), 218,000. The
number of movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport operations in 1959
was 358,000 for all United Kingdom aerodromes.
Development
London Airport, already the largest and busiest airport in Western Europe, will
be strained to capacity within the next few years owing both to the increasing number
of passengers and to the increased size of the new jet aircraft that many international
airlines are bringing into service. The recommendations of a special committee, set
up in 1957, to consider the future of London Airport have been accepted by the Govern¬
ment as the framework of the airport’s development. Most of the European short-haul
services are now handled at the new passenger buildings in the central terminal area
opened in April 1955. For long-distance passengers a £3 million terminal is being
constructed; these buildings will be completed in 1962. The new airport at Gatwick,
25 miles south of London, has been developed as the second airport for London.
Initially it is being used as the main bad weather alternative to London Airport, and
for services to the Channel Islands by BEA and some of the independent operators;
eventually many more European services are expected to operate from this airport.
Built alongside the main London to Brighton railway, it is the first airport in the world
to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit. A privately owned helicopter terminal
(or ‘heliport’) was opened in London, on the south bank of the Thames, in April 1959.
Prestwick (near Ayr, in Scotland), the second international airport in the United
Kingdom, is to be developed so that it can accommodate the new large jet aircraft.
The runways at Ringway Airport, near Manchester, have been lengthened and a new
terminal building is being built.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation Services
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for providing efficient navigation and traffic
control services for all civil aircraft flying over or near the United Kingdom. Meteoro¬
logical information is provided by the Air Ministry. The Ministry of Aviation’s Air
Traffic Control Service is responsible for the safe, orderly and expeditious move¬
ment of all civil airliners flying into the United Kingdom along the corridors of
controlled airspace called airways.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
389
In 1959, the Government established the Air Traffic Control Board, consisting of an
independent chairman and representatives of the Ministry of Aviation, the Air
Ministry and the Admiralty. The functions of the Board are to formulate air traffic
control policy in the United Kingdom, to act as the co-ordinating body in negotiations
with other countries, and with the ICAO. The Board is assisted by an air traffic control
executive, and is responsible jointly to the Minister of Aviation and the Secretary
of State for Air.
In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation introduced a system of
airways covering the main traffic routes and associated with controlled zones around
the major airports. During 1957 and 1958 a revised and extended airways system was
brought into use. There are three main air traffic control centres, operated jointly
by the Ministry of Aviation’s Air Traffic Control Service and by the Royal Air Force,
at London Airport for southern England, at Preston for the north of England and
Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic. The Southern Air Traffic
Control Centre, situated on the boundary of London Airport, is one of the most
advanced control centres in the world.
In order to provide the means by which the air traffic control system can accept
the increasingly heavy load of air traffic, the ministry has provided a variety of radar
installations and equipment. The United Kingdom was the first country to use radar
for the control of civil air traffic. The radar approach system known as Ground Con¬
trolled Approach (GCA) is now in use at all major airports in the United Kingdom,
in addition to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). A series of long-range radar
stations that is being set up will extend radar coverage very widely.
The ministry has provided a number of radio navigational aids to help aircraft to
remain safely within the controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their
time of arrival. In addition, the ministry supports the Decca Air and Marine Navigator
System now operating over a wide area of the United Kingdom and northern Europe
which can be used, by arrangement with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted
with the appropriate receiving equipment. Research is in progress into new landing
aids for use in bad weather. A unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, at Bedford, is
developing an automatic landing system which is expected to be in use within the next
few years.
Radio stations maintained by the ministry provide air to ground communications
for the use of the Air Traffic Control Service. There is also a network of communi¬
cations between ground stations in the United Kingdom and between United Kingdom
and overseas ground stations.
On routes outside the United Kingdom, British airline operators rely upon ground
organisation provided by the countries over which they fly. In January i947> the
airways corporations took the initiative in forming a company, registered in the
United Kingdom, called International Aeradio Limited (IAL), for the purpose of
helping countries in need of assistance by providing radio communications, air traffic
control and navigational facilities for civil aviation. Airlines of other countries have
accepted invitations to become shareholders, and the membership is broadly repre¬
sentative of international civil aviation. IAL operates by entering into contracts with
Governments to provide whatever degree of assistance is required to enable States
or Administrations to fulfil their international obligations under the Chicago Convention
•on Civil Aviation for the provision and maintenance of ground facilities for civil
aviation. In i960, International Aeradio Ltd. was operating, either directly or through
subsidiary or associated companies, in 30 countries. It has over 45 overseas stations
all over the world as well as at London and Cranfield, Bedfordshire, in the United
39°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Kingdom. In all overseas areas, IAL trains locally engaged staff up to the standards
required for the services it provides; this policy has been so successful that more than
85 per cent of overseas staff are locally recruited. At Southall, Middlesex, IAL has
established a School of Air Traffic Control to train its own air traffic control officers
as well as those from other interested organisations.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of some 371,000 is a Government department. It
is also the oldest of Britain’s State undertakings. In 1657, under the Protectorate
of Cromwell, an Act of Parliament was passed which declared that ‘there shall be
one general post-office and one officer, styled the Postmaster General of England
and Comptroller of the Post Office’.1
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General who, with the
Assistant Postmaster General, is responsible to Parliament for his department. Under |
the Postmaster General, the permanent head of the Post Office is the Director General,
who is supported by three Deputy Directors General, one of whom is the Comptroller
and Accountant General, and an Engineer-in-Chief. At the next level there are eight
departmental directors and a Public Relations Officer. The Post Office headquarters is
in St. Martin’s-le-Grand in the City of London.
Six of the main divisions of work at headquarters are carried down into the organisa¬
tion of three directorates—Scotland, Wales and Border Counties, and Northern
Ireland—each under the control of a director of the Post Office, and, in England,
seven regions, each under the control of a regional director; London has two regional
directors, one for postal services and one for telecommunications. In the United
Kingdom there are 475 head post offices, nearly 25,000 subordinate post offices, and
56 telephone areas.
The staff at headquarters and in the directorates and regions is divided into twa
main groups: general Civil Service grades (administrative, executive and clerical)
and special grades recruited directly by the Post Office for its engineering and
operational activities.
The Postmaster General normally presides over meetings of the Post Office Advisory
Council, on which the principal users of the Post Office services are represented.
In addition, there are about 190 local Post Office Advisory Committees, on which are
represented local authorities, chambers of commerce, women’s organisations, the
press and other local interests; these committees are formed on the initiative of, and
are maintained by, the local interests, and are not organs of the Post Office.
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications and remittance business; (2) agency services—
savings services, broadcasting services and business undertaken on behalf of other
Government departments.
Although a Government department, the Post Office is also an immense trading
concern. Its Commercial Accounts for 1958-59 showed that its income that year was
£417 million and its expenditure ^408-3 million, leaving a surplus of £8-7 million.
The postal and telephone services earned surpluses of ^3 million and ^8-2 million
respectively, and the telegraph service incurred a deficit of ^2-5 million.
In i960, the Government proposed, in a White Paper, The Status of the Post Office
1 Charles II declared all Cromwellian Acts null and void at the Restoration, but his Parliament,
passed a similar Act in 1660.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
391
(Cmnd. 989), that more practical recognition than hitherto should be given to the
commercial character of the Post Office, but that direct control by a minister responsible
to Parliament should be retained. Under the proposals, Post Office finances would be
separated from the Exchequer: there would be a separate Post Office Fund, managed
by the Postmaster General, into which all Post Office receipts would be paid and out of
which all payments would be made. Traditional Treasury controls over the expenditure
of money raised by taxation were said to be inappropriate for an organisation whose
aim was to live on what its customers spent on its services. These controls would,
therefore, not be exercised over the Post Office, except in relation to investment and
foreign exchange, and the pay and conditions of Post Office staff, who would remain
civil servants. While not neglecting its social obligations, the Post Office would be
required to ensure that its income would be enough, taking one year with another, to
pay its expenses. Parliament would still be able to satisfy itself about Post Office
policy and management, and the borrowing of money for capital expenditure would
still be authorised by Acts. It was hoped that legislation to give effect to the
proposals would be introduced in the Parliamentary session beginning in the autumn
of i960.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the
time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail
transport. There was a great expansion in the postal services in the eighteenth century
with the introduction of mail-coaches in 1784. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
the Post Office was quick to take advantage of Britain’s early lead in engineering and
railway development, and the first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830 between
Liverpool and Manchester.
The heavy charges, based upon the actual distance a letter was carried, were among
the factors which inspired Rowland Hill in his great work of postal reform that led to
the establishment of a uniform postage rate. In 1840, a uniform inland rate of postage
of one penny per half-ounce payable in advance came into operation, prepayment
to be made by means of adhesive postage stamps. Since the business world found
cheap postage a boon and since it proved ultimately a great financial success, it was
imitated by almost every country in the world.
The inauguration of the penny post (the rate remained unchanged until 1918)1
was followed by a rapid extension of the scope of the postal services, beginning in
1841 with the introduction of the registered post to ensure additional safety for
valuable mail. The money order system, which had operated as a private venture
from 1792 to 1838, was supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed
amounts. Letterboxes had been instituted in London in 1855 to facilitate the increased
postal traffic, and in 1883 the parcel post was introduced. By the end of the nineteenth
century a regular delivery of letters was assured to every house in Britain. In the
twenty-one years from 1938-39 to 1958-59, the parcel post increased from 185
million items a year to 243 million, registered postal traffic from 62 million to 94
million and other postal correspondence from 8,240 million to 9,700 million. Every
day the Post Office handles about 27 million letters and parcels. Each year the
Post Office deals with an ever-increasing volume of Christmas mail; during the
Christmas-New Year season, 1959-60, more than 920 million letters and cards were
posted.
1 The minimum postage rate for inland letters is now 3d. for one ounce.
392
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Post Office’s services have been developed to match the needs of the traffic.
Improvements include the provision of motor mail vans1 and electrical trucks for
parcel deliveries, controlled by walking postmen, postal-sorting carriages on the
railways, special mail trains on certain routes and the ingenious apparatus by which
bags of mail are delivered and collected by trains running at express speed. For
quick transmission of mails within the central area of London, the Post Office has
for 21 years operated an automatically controlled underground railway that runs
for miles connecting Paddington in the west with Whitechapel in the east and
serving six intermediate stations; a seventh station is under construction.
The Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, London, has developed a partly
electronic letter-sorting machine (ELSIE). Twenty machines are being tested at
busy centres, and at Norwich, where postal codes are being used experimentally in
addresses on mail, all the sorting of small letters is mechanised. An experiment with
a fully automatic sorting machine is being carried out at Luton. A parcel-sorting
machine has been developed and installed at Leeds; new parcel offices being erected
in London and Manchester are designed to accommodate units. Field experiments are
being carried out with machines for separating letters and packets, and for automatic
‘letter-facing’ (ALF), i.e. stacking letters with all the stamps in the same corner.
Airmail Services
Railways and motor vans as means of transport for mail are supplemented by
ships and aeroplanes. Each year about 3,000 tons of mail are carried by air within
the United Kingdom. Special night air services for mail are run between Great
Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. In the year ended March 1959,
total overseas correspondence amounted to 450 million items, 65 per cent of which
travelled by air. First-class mail to all European countries is sent by air or by surface
transport, whichever offers earlier delivery, without payment of any air surcharge.
The Post Office dispatches about 35 tons of letter mail a week to European destinations
by this ‘all-up’ service, mainly in aircraft of British European Airways, whose network
of services enables many of the letters posted in London for Europe to be delivered
the following day. The air parcel service now operates to all countries in Europe
except Roumania, and about 12 tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly to Europe
by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. Light-weight air letters
costing 6d. each are popular, and air parcel services are also available to some 150
countries outside Europe.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of the
Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission of inland
telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present automatic
switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most up-to-date
systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the 500 larger telegraph
offices. The Post Office accepted 14 million inland telegrams in 1958-59, of which
nearly a quarter were greetings telegrams; the average time between handing in an
inland telegram and its receipt at the delivery office was 20 minutes.
1 In 1919, the Post Office inaugurated its own motor transport fleet with 48 vehicles;
this fleet now numbers over 37,500, of which about 14,600 are red mail vans, and 19,200 are
green engineering vans.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
393
Telex
The Telex Service provides a communication system which combines the speed of
the telephone and the authority of the printed word. Customers are provided with a
teleprinter and a line to the nearest telex exchange. Calls may be made between the
rapidly increasing number of telex users in the United Kingdom (6,000 in June i960)
and also to some 100,000 subscribers spread throughout the world. To send a message,
the subscriber types it on the keyboard of his teleprinter: it is then reproduced
simultaneously on both the sending and receiving subscribers’ installations.
The service is available day and night except for a few routes outside Europe.
Messages may be transmitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is unattended,
and thus are available for attention when his office reopens. Use of the telex service
is expanding rapidly and the Post Office is planning for a system of 20,000 subscribers
in the United Kingdom by 1970.
For call charging purposes the United Kingdom is divided into 50 charging areas,
each with its telex centre. By the end of i960, all inland telex calls will be connected
automatically by dialling and charged in 2d. units, the amount of time bought for 2d.
ranging from 60 to 15 seconds according to the distance of the call.
Inland and overseas telegrams may be sent to the Post Oftice and to cable offices
by telex. No charge is made for these calls and the telegrams are charged for at normal
rates. Arrangements may also be made for incoming telegrams to be received by telex.
Telephones
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Company
in 1912, it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in the country.
Local authorities wishing to operate their own telephone services were permitted
to do so under licence from the Postmaster General, but the only municipal system
now in existence is that provided by the Corporation of Hull. Local telephone service
in the Channel Islands is provided, also under licence, by their Governments’ telephone
departments. The Hull and Channel Islands local systems, although operated
independently of the Post Office system, are connected to the Post Office trunk network.
At the end of March 1959, there were 6,009 local telephone exchanges in the United
Kingdom. There were some 7-53 million telephones, including 73,000 telephone
call offices for public use. Four-fifths of the telephones are connected to automatic
exchanges and it is planned that by 1970 all the exchanges will be automatically
operated. Telephones are being connected at the rate of about 400,000 a year.
A system of national telephone numbers is planned, which will make it possible to dial
trunk calls. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958; the
system will have been extended to about forty other towns by the end of i960, to 60
per cent of all telephones by 1965 and to 90 per cent of all telephones by 1970. The
introduction of this new group routing and charging equipment (GRACE) will bring
the advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and cheap long distance calls
of short duration, and will constitute the most radical reform of the telephone service
since the Post Office assumed national responsibility for it.
The number of trunk calls made has trebled since 1939; in the year ended 31st
March, 1959, the Post Office handled a total of 340 million, of which nearly a quarter
were at the cheap night rate, available from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and during the whole of
Sundays. The number of local calls handled during the year ended 31st March, 1959,
was 3,700 million, an increase of 74 per cent compared with 1938-39.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of vehicles
fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them from, any
394
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
telephone in the United Kingdom network. Telephones transmitting messages
through loudspeakers instead of through instruments held by hand were made available
to the public in i960.
There are several specialised services available by telephone. Well over 90 per
cent of subscribers served by automatic exchanges can use the ‘999’ emergency
dialling service, which enables them to be connected as quickly as possible, and free
of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade services, and in coastal districts to
lifeboat and coastguard stations. The automatic time service gives over 3 million
callers access to the correct time when they dial the three-letter code TIM or a figure
code which connects them to a speaking clock. A telephone weather forecast service
is available in nine cities. In London, a telephone information service provides details
in English, French and German of important events being held in and around the
capital on the day of the call. There is a similar service in Edinburgh and Glasgow
during the summer months: the announcements are in English only. A test match
cricket score service operates at about 30 centres during the cricket season and a road
weather service is provided in collaboration with the Automobile Association at nine
centres from 1st October to 30th April each year.
Private Telecommunications Services
There are 93,500 circuits not connected with the public exchange networks. These
circuits are rented for private use for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections,
photo-telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of signals which represent
data for computers or operate other devices.
Overseas Telecommunications
All the overseas telephone services from the United Kingdom have for a great
many years been developed and operated by the Post Office. The overseas telegraph
services, on the other hand, were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable
and Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947. The
Post Office, which acquired the United Kingdom services, operates all overseas tele¬
graph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign telegraph
companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd., now a Government agency, continues to operate
its cable and wireless services in many colonial and foreign territories.
The overseas telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated from inter¬
national centres in London.
Telegraphs. Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House,
Victoria Embankment, London. In the year ended 31st March, 1959, 12-2 million
messages were transmitted from London, and a similar number received.
Telex. The International Telex Exchange provides a teleprinter service to nearly 50
countries abroad. In 1958-59, 1-9 million outgoing international calls were made,
and a similar number received from abroad. In mid-1961, facilities will be
provided enabling telex customers in the United Kingdom to dial direct to many
European countries.
Telephones. Telephone service to Europe is through the Continental Exchange in
London, from which some 800 direct telephone circuits give service to all
countries except Albania. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures,
and special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions. In 1958-59, 2-5 million
outgoing calls were made. Automatic dialling by operators to subscribers in
certain European countries has been extended and will be further developed.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
395
Radio circuits which provide service with most countries outside Europe and with
many of the larger liners at sea are connected through the International Exchange
(also in London).
In 1956, the first transatlantic telephone cable—also the first long-distance submarine
telephone system in the world—was inaugurated. The cable provides 43 telephone
circuits with the United States and 13 with Canada. Six circuits are used to provide
direct telephone communication between the United States and six continental
countries. In addition to the telephone circuits, the cable carries some 60 telegraph
and telex channels to the United States and 24 telegraph channels to Canada, the
latter supplementing the existing telegraph cables and improving communications
with Australia and New Zealand via Canada. The system provides a secure service
that is dependable day and night and free from the distortions and fadeouts
that affect radiotelephone circuits. The whole project was undertaken jointly by
the United Kingdom Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, which jointly
maintain it. TTTx/rrrc
Another transatlantic cable is to be laid by the Post Office cable ship HM1S
Monarch, between Scotland and Newfoundland, by 1961, at a cost of ^8-5 million,
and will provide capacity for at least 60 simultaneous telephone conversations. It will
form part of the projected round-the-world Commonwealth telephone cable agreed
in principle at the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference held in Montreal
in 1958. It is expected that the £26 million section across the Pacific ocean, between
Canada and New Zealand, will be laid by 1964, the New Zealand-Australia section
having been laid by 1962. This will complete the first half—some 14,000 route miles
 of the network round the world. Completion of the second half, via Singapore,
East Pakistan, India, West Pakistan, South Africa and thence to Britain, is expected to
take a further five years after 1964. The cost of the whole project is estimated at
about /80 million; the United Kingdom will contribute about 50 per cent of the
capital cost, the remaining 50 per cent being shared by other Commonwealth countries.
In i960, the United Kingdom Post Office and the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company concluded an agreement to construct a third transatlantic telephone cable,
by 1963, at a cost of £12 million. This will be the largest ocean cable in the world
and will carry 128 telephone circuits between the United Kingdom and the United
States, providing for the rapidly increasing telephone traffic between the two countries.
Before the first transatlantic cable came into use in 1936, the weekly averages of radio
calls between London and Canada and between London and the United States
were 530 and 2,320, respectively. By March i960, traffic had risen to weekly
averages of 2,400 and 6,800, and was growing at the rate of about 500 calls a
month. The first telephone cable between the United Kingdom and Sweden was
laid in i960, and one between Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland is to e
laid in 1961; later, this will link with a cable from Iceland via Greenland to
Canada
A new cable ship of 4,000 tons is being built for the Post Office, at a cost of about
/i-c million; it will be used mainly for the maintenance of cables in the noith Atlantic.
A second new cable ship, of 7,000 tons, which will be used in laying the Commonwealth
cable, is to be built at a cost of over £2 million. „ . . .
The United Kingdom is a member of the European Postal and Telecommunications
Administration and of the International Telecommunication Union which is the
co-ordinating body for telecommunications throughout the world, and has its head-
quarters at Geneva.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ship-to-Shore Radio Communications
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post Office
has ii coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations provide for radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of up to
some 300 miles. There is also the long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead-
Radio, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take immediate
action to obtain assistance for any vessel in distress. During 1959, the stations handled
205 urgent and SOS calls from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships, connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
ashore and suitably equipped ships, broadcast navigational warnings and weather
bulletins, and operate direction-finding services for ships.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities on
the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During 1959 the
stations dealt with 374 medical inquiries in this service.
The Post-Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family allowance,
buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his car
licence and buy national insurance stamps and premium savings bonds. In most of
these and many similar transactions the Post Office is an agent for other Government
departments or local authorities. Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation
and the widening scope of the social services, the volume of work measured on a time
basis at post office counters has increased greatly compared with the total for 1938-39.
In the twenty-one years to 1958-59, the value of transactions with the public increased
from just over £1,000 million to £5,825 million. In 1958-59, the Post Office paid out
37 million postal drafts in payment of benefits under the National Insurance Scheme,
and sold £53 million worth of premium savings bonds.1
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 3lsl March, i959> about 694 million postal orders were issued
by post offices. The work of the Post Office Savings Bank is described in Chapter XII.
Post Office engineers were responsible for the development of ERNIK, the electronic random
number indicating equipment used for selecting winning premium savings bond numbers.
XII. FINANCE
A detailed description of the financial system of the United Kingdom may be found
in the comprehensive report of the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System
(Cmnd. 827), published in August 1959. This committee was set up by the Govern¬
ment in April 1957, under the chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe; the inquiry was the
first of the kind since 1931.
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (i.e. the central Govern¬
ment and local authorities) finance their activities—how their expenditure is decided
upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into two
categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but also
in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in accordance
with the proposals of the Government, as approved by Parliament (principally
the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central Govern¬
ment departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts which
do not come from the Exchequer. The only important one is the National
Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Pensions and National
Insurance, used for the payment of benefits under the National Insurance
Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes on
dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property and trading
receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer, and partly rom
loans raised in the open market (see p. 75).
The following broad account of Government finance will be concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other public
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom. , m • 1
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gra ua ^ ev°
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the Stu
period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the K g
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, e was ree o spen 1
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of Commons gradu y
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that of the

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
398
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation, which was embodied in the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed to
both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to modify
financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus, to minimise the
chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of embodying the main financial
provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since the passing of the Parliament
Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords is no longer needed for a Bill
certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see p. 39).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all expenditure
by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by taxation or borrowing.
AJl Government revenue, other than sums received by Government departments in
the course of their normal activities (known as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the
Government account with the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account
or the Consolidated Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously
stated, being National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come
out of this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and the
sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Classification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
!• Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Act of Parliament without
limitation to any particular year. This expenditure includes the interest,
sinking funds and cost of management of the National Debt, the financial
provision made for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions
of judges and certain high officers whose independence of the Government
is thought to be better guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
These Consolidated Fund Services represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorised from year to year1
and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply Services
because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting to the
Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy ... the pecuniary
necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some of this expen¬
diture may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health Service
Acts, which relates to a specific object of expenditure.
1 The financial year in the United Kingdom runs from xst April to 31st March.
FINANCE
399
Authorisation of Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of Commons
in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with the Chairman
of Committees, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The committee usually discusses
public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate could be examined in
detail if members wished and if time allowed (see also p. 40).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April are
submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding November and
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the
Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes. Inside each
Vote, a ‘virement’, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
The Service departments may spend money on one Vote instead of another, but only
with Treasury sanction which, in turn, requires the retrospective authorisation of
Parliament. Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they
please subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An insufficient estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or a virement
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to the
attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The Treasury exercises
the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons
and by the Select Committee on Estimates.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the responsibility
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments, the Treasury
has to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the monetary and
economic cost, taking into account current Government policy, to decide the relative
merits of expenditure proposed by different departments and to eliminate any over¬
lapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, throughout
the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates of pay and the
aggregate size of the staff in all Government departments, in addition to exercising a
general supervision over all departmental expenditure. The I reasury also lays down
general rules of financial and accounting procedure for departments and prescribes
the principles on which departmental contracts shall be made and the limits within
which losses may be written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is exercised
by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appointment as
an officer of Parliament. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller of the
Exchequer he controls entries and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer
400
BRITAIN.' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Account; and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts and submits his
report on the Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure
that all expenditure is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made which go
beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been obtained
wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged by successive
Committees on Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to examine departmental
expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any cases of apparent waste or
extravagance.
The Public Accounts Committee
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by the
Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee called the
Public Accounts Committee (PAC). This was first set up in 1861, on the motion of
Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred
in accordance with the way it was voted and with any relevant Acts of Parliament.
The terms of reference of the committee are to examine the accounts and these terms
have been widely interpreted by the committee, which investigates whether full value
has been obtained for the sums spent by departments and examines cases in which the
administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee has therefore
become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies
its findings in reports which may be debated in the House of Commons. Its recom¬
mendations are considered by the Treasury in consultation with departments and put
into effect, so far as they are accepted, according to Treasury instructions. If the
recommendations are not acceptable, a reasoned reply is submitted to the committee
of the following session, which may either accept the objections or return to the charge
in subsequent reports.
Select Committee on Estimates
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed annually
except during the war years. The committee’s functions are to examine the Estimates,
to report whether there are any economies which could be made without altering the
policy implied in the Estimates and to suggest the form in which the Estimates should
be presented. Usually, the committee selects each year a few Votes, or aspects of
Government-voted services, for review.
Since 1945, the committee has functioned through the medium of four, later five,
sub-committees, which carry out extensive investigations into the departments under
consideration. In practice, the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the
committee’s recommendations produce changes in future Estimates and strengthen
Treasury control.
THE BUDGET
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The use
of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor of the
Exchequer opened his Budget, which was applied in Parliament to the annual speech
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals for balancing revenue and
expenditure.
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation, and its formal basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising
money by taxation. By the time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Esti¬
mates of expenditure under various headings will have been presented to Parliament
FINANCE
401
and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for the year will be
known. The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis of existing
taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as will provide whatever surplus or
deficit he considers desirable on economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied
in detail in a Finance Bill. The gap between the Budget Statement and the Royal
Assent to the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the Provisional Collection
of Taxes Act, 1913, whereby changes in income tax and customs and excise duties1
have immediate statutory effect if adopted by Resolution of the House of Commons.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to certain payments of a capital
nature for which the Government has statutory power to borrow and which are there¬
fore excluded from the Budget expenditure met from revenue. These items and others
are set out in the part of the Budget which lies ‘below the line’.2
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of expendi¬
ture on particular goods and services. At a later period it was realised that taxation
also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general level of economic
activity. Since the second wTorld wTar, Budgets have been consciously designed in
greater or lesser degree to bring the total demand for goods and services into balance
with the supplies which could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a high
income taken in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one; at the
same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or kind) are
generally available to all, irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are specially
designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect, or outlay taxes (see p. 404)
do not affect the distribution of income; their main purpose has always been the
raising of revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular
goods they can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the total demand
for goods and services, in the following way: if there is an increase in Government
expenditure without an increase in taxation then total demand for goods and services
will tend to rise; the same thing will happen if there is a decrease in taxation without
a decrease in Government spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter
unemployment. On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
in Government expenditure or a decrease in Government expenditure without a
decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will tend to fall.
In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to avoid
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or the defence programme. Between 1953 an<^ I955>
Budgets were aimed particularly at encouraging higher investment and production.
The Supplementary Budget of October i955> an<^ succeeding Budget, had the
object of curtailing excessive internal demand and of strengthening the balance of
1 In 1957, the Act was extended to include purchase tax.
2 Items ‘below the line’ are: (1) receipts applicable by statute to debt interest which would
otherwise be paid out of revenue; (2) receipts applicable to debt redemption; and (3) payments
for which the Treasury has power to borrow.
402

payments position. After some reductions in taxation in 1957 and 1958, the aim of the
Budget of April 1959, which provided for further important reductions in taxation
and an increased rate of repayment of post-war credits, was to give a further stimulus
to economic activity and to encourage the utilisation of spare industrial capacity while
ensuring that price stability was maintained. The i960 Budget was designed to con¬
solidate and fortify the progress of the United Kingdom’s economy; it was also the
occasion for a number of technical reforms in the system of taxation, aimed at
minimising tax avoidance.
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the central
Government is in normal years derived from taxation. Taxes can be divided into
two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond roughly to the duties collected
by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Board of Customs and Excise. The
most important inland revenue duties—income tax (including surtax), profits tax
and estate duty (death duty)—are levied directly on the income or property of those
who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on individual (though not on corporate)
incomes and estate duty are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates
bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. Stamp duties, although not a direct tax, are
also collected by the Board of Inland Revenue. Taxes on motor vehicles are collected
by the principal local taxation authorities, which are the county or county borough
councils in England and Wales and the corresponding councils in Scotland; the
proceeds are paid by the local authorities to the Exchequer.
Income Tax, Surtax, and Profits Tax
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. The standard rate for the year 1960-61 is 7s. 9d. in the £ (38-75 per
cent). The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances
and reliefs, by reduced rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income,1 and by the
surtax.2 In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated
and are treated as one income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a single
person.
Examples of the amounts of income tax paid yearly by people with different incomes
and family responsibilities are shown in Table 26.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (Tay-as-you-
earn’) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling them to keep up
to date in tax payments.
Companies are liable at the standard rate of tax on their total income irrespective
of its amount; they are also subject to profits tax, the rate of which was increased from
10 per cent to 12^ per cent from 1st April, i960.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the United
Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including companies) resident
in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that interest on certain United
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and reliefs
is taxable income. For 1960-61 the reduced rates are: is. pd. in the £ on the first £60; 4s. 3d.
in the £ on the next £150; and 6s. 3d. in the £ on the following £150. The remainder is charged
at the standard rate.
2 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal incomes
exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess of the single
person’s basic allowance. It is imposed at rates which increase progressively until (for 1960-61)
on all income above £15,000 a year, income tax and surtax combined amount to 17s. gd. in the £.

Kingdom Government securities belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in
the United Kingdom is exempt; income from certain classes of possessions abroad is
chargeable not on the amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted
to the United Kingdom; and the trading income of specified overseas trade corporations1
is not charged so long as it remains undistributed. The United Kingdom has entered
into agreements with many countries providing for relief from double taxation;
where such agreements are not in force, the United Kingdom allows unilateral relief.2

(a) Age Relief. Where the taxpayer (or his wife) is 65 or over and his total income does not
exceed £800, age relief is given; this reduces the tax payable to that chargeable on the earned
income scale. Where the total income exceeds £800, marginal relief is given so that the full tax
on the investment income scale is not payable until marginal rehei runs out.

£275; a married couple is exempt if either of them is aged 6S or over and their joint income
does not exceed £440 There is marginal relief where the income slightly exceeds these limits.

Estate Duty
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or not)
which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to property owned
by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds to the income of which
the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to gifts made by the deceased within
five years of his death (one year in the case of a gift for public or charitable purposes).
Estates with a net capital value of £3,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates
of a higher value there is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
Indirect Taxes
Most indirect or outlay taxes are customs and excise duties and are levied on
commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer, manufacturer,
wholesaler, or provider of commodities or services pays them first and then adjusts
his prices to his customers accordingly.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and excise duties on goods produced,
and services provided, at home. The purchase tax, which is also collected by the
Board of Customs and Excise, applies equally, and at the same rate, to home-produced
and to imported goods.
The system of customs duties is twofold in its purpose: it has the function of provid¬
ing a measure of protection for British industries or preference for products imported
from Commonwealth countries overseas and it has also the function, in association
with the excise system, of providing revenue.
The principal revenue duties collected by the Board of Customs and Excise are
those on tobacco, alcoholic drinks and hydrocarbon oil (mostly petrol and diesel
fuel for road vehicles). There are a number of smaller revenue duties, e.g., on betting,
television, matches and sugar. The protective customs duties cover a wider field, but |
their contribution to the yield of indirect taxation is relatively small.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them consumer
goods, at rates varying from 5 per cent to 50 per cent of the wholesale value. Articles
subject to revenue duties of customs and excise are in general exempt from this tax;
other goods free of purchase tax include food, fuel, books and newspapers, young
children’s clothing and footwear, certain non-proprietary drugs and medicines, some
household appliances and textiles.
THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS, 1960-61
In the Budget of April i960, total current expenditure for the financial year ending
31st March, 1961, was estimated to reach £5,676 million, while the estimate for total
current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £5,980 million, making a
surplus of £304 million. These figures exclude self-balancing revenue and expenditure
such as Post Office trading. ‘Below the line’ total payments were estimated at £1,054
million, while total receipts were estimated at £432 million, leaving a deficit, to be
borrowed or met from the surplus on current account, of £622 million.
Table 27 shows the Budget estimates for 1960-61 in comparison with the out¬
turn (Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year. The diagram on p. 406
illustrates the pattern of Government estimates of revenue and expenditure on current
account in 1960-61.
CAPITAL PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS

other nationalised industries; loans to local authorities; loans under the Export
Guarantees Acts; and loans for house purchase. Capital receipts have come mainly
from the repayment of loans to local authorities and nationalised industries. If, on
balance, there is a deficit, it is met from the proceeds of Government borrowing or
from the surplus, if any, in ‘Ordinary ’ revenue and expenditure, i.e., ‘above the line’;
while if there were a surplus it would go to reduce the National Debt.
Apart from the use of surpluses, repayments and extra-budgetary funds such as the
National Insurance Fund, Exchequer payments ‘below the line’ are financed by
direct borrowing from the public either through the National Savings Movement (see
p. 410) or by borrowing on the stock market by means of new issues of securities.
New issues of Government securities are made from time to time for the purpose
of refinancing maturing issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues for
cash). Since 1956, capital requirements of the nationalised industries have been met by
the Exchequer, while most of the requirements of the local authorities since 1955 have
been met by direct borrowing from the public by mortgages or stock issues; net
Exchequer lending {via the Local Loans Fund) to local authorities has steadily
diminished since 1955 and in the last two years local authorities have, on balance,
been repaying debt to the Central Government.
The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in
1914 to ^7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million
in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March, i960, the total National
Debt was £27,735 million, of which £2,043 million was repayable in currencies other
than sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the £25,692
million of internal debt, about £5,803 million was short-term debt, mainly in the form
of 91-day bills on the Treasury, while the long-term loans included a variety of
stocks, bonds, loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from
2\ t0 5? Per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
PUBLIC FINANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main features,
similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under which public
revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the Exchequer, from which no
money can be withdrawn except on the authority of Parliament. That authority is
expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund charges in permanent legislative form,
and in the case of Supply Services by annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates
prepared by departments and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties, purchase
tax, income tax, surtax and profits tax) is imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament
over the whole country, and is paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom
Exchequer. From the amount attributable to Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved’
Revenue, there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under the
Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the sum contributed by Northern Ireland towards
Imperial Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the cost of the administration
of the Supreme Court, the Post Office, and other Reserved Services, and the cost of
collecting Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved
Taxes’, is paid over to the Exchequer of Northern Ireland and joins with the proceeds

of taxes levied and collected by the Government of Northern Ireland, called ‘Trans¬
ferred’ Revenue, and with other non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous nature, to form
the public income. The items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp
duties, pool betting duty, bookmakers’ licence duties, cinemas (entertainments duty),
television licence duty, most excise licence duties, and motor vehicle duties.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry of
Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Government
of Ireland Act, 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and the cost of
Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year, the amount of
the Imperial Contribution and such other questions affecting the financial relations
of the two Governments as may be referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1960-61 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £ 117-47 million and expenditure at £111-4 million. After
allowing for a small Budget surplus of £55,580, the Imperial Contribution was
provisionally estimated at £6 million.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £56 million on 31st March, i960,
is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry of
Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes.
In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal being
those relating to National Insurance and Government loans. The latter constitutes
a pool of capital money available for local and public authority borrowings; on 31st
March, i960, a sum of approximately £81 million was outstanding against such
authorities.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It comprises
a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main banking services;
the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in other countries;
and various specialised banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it also
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate body, and its entire capital stock was
acquired by the Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating the appli¬
cation of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main instruments for this
purpose is the Bank Rate1—the minimum rate at which the Bank of England will
discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in the general pattern of interest
rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of exchange
control which has been in force since 1939.
1 On 25th August, i960, the Bank Rate stood at 6 per cent.
FINANCE
409
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and these
balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under an agreement reached
in July 1958 with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks, the Bank of England
may call on these banks for ‘special deposits’ which, not being freely disposable, do
not rank as part of their liquid assets. This scheme, designed to restrict the liquidity
of the banking system should the need arise, was first put into operation in April i960,
when each of the banks was called upon to deposit, by 15th June, i960, a sum equiva¬
lent to 1 per cent per cent for Scottish banks) of its total deposits. A further
call of 1 per cent per cent for Scottish banks) was made on 23rd June, i960.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, together with
a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and coin being the ‘Fiduciary
Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary control. In practice very little
gold is now held by the Issue Department of the Bank of England, the bulk of the
United Kingdom gold (and foreign exchange) reserves being in a separate Government
fund, known as the Exchange Equalisation Account; this account was originally
established in 1932, for the purpose of checking undue fluctuations in the exchange
value of sterling and is operated by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury.
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of a Government department,
the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the United
Kingdom are limited liability companies which, in the main, are subject to the ordinary
law relating to such companies.
Some of the main features of the United Kingdom commercial banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
United Kingdom banking members of the British Bankers’ Association
include 11 London clearing banks,1 5 banks in Scotland and 3 in Northern
Ireland, and control nearly 13,000 branches and have total assets of over
£9,800 million.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
—are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1959 through the London and Provincial Clearing
Houses was £657 million; and many cheques do not, for various reasons,
pass through clearing houses.
3. It is the practice of the London clearing banks to maintain a ratio of about
8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which about three-
fifths are repayable on demand, the remainder being mainly deposits at interest
and subject to notice).
The banks make advances to customers partly in the form of overdrafts
and partly in the form of loans (with or without collateral security); in either
case, the advance is normally for a short term only, unless renewed.
The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits declined
from about 43 per cent in 1938 to about 17 per cent at the end of the war,
but gradually climbed back to settle down to a level of 26 to 30 per cent for a
1 Three of these banks are members of the London clearing house but have headquarters
outside London (at Liverpool and Manchester).
4io
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
number of years from 1951. After the withdrawal in 1958 of official requests
to the banks to restrict the level of their advances, the percentage again
moved up, and by April i960 was back to the 1938 level of 43 per cent.1 This
increase was accompanied by innovations in bank lending practice, including
the introduction of schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly
instalments over periods up to two years, and facilities for limited service
accounts at low cost. Another development was the acquisition by many banks
of share capital in hire purchase finance companies.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by legislation for
each bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.
United Kingdom Offices of Banks Operating Mainly Overseas
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in other Commonwealth countries and foreign countries to maintain London
offices2; in some cases, indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom
companies and the London office is the head office. These London offices form part
of the complex structure engaged in the financing of trade not only between the
United Kingdom and other countries but also in goods which are shipped direct
between other countries.
Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank is to
provide readily available facilities for the investment of savings, particularly the
small savings of persons with low incomes. Both these types of banks were already
well established during the nineteenth century. The growth of their business was,
however, encouraged in the first world war when the War Savings Committee was
set up under Government auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type
of long-term security for the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was
the National Savings Certificate, with interest payable only on encashment, but free of
income tax. From this war-time drive originated the present National Savings Move¬
ment devoted to the encouragement of the widespread investment of savings in Trustee
Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National Savings Certificates
and Defence Bonds. The policy of the movement is determined by the National
Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.3 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing
regional savings organisations and various national institutions connected with such
matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried staff of
civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or promoted by local
authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups. In 1956, the Govern-
1 About 31 per cent of the bank’s deposits at this time were covered by cash and other highly
liquid securities, while 20 per cent were covered by British Government and other long-term
securities. It is an invariably accepted convention that at least 30 per cent of deposits should be
covered by cash and other liquid securities.
2 Twenty-nine overseas banks are members of the British Bankers’ Association.
3 The Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance is responsible for the administration of Ulster
Savings, but the furtherance and organisation of the savings movement in Northern Ireland is
the concern of a central voluntary committee, which is assisted by county and local committees
and district groups, all of a voluntary nature.
FINANCE

ment introduced an additional type of savings security—Premium Savings Bonds,
issued in £1 units—which, after an initial period of six months and thereafter monthly,
give investors a chance to win prizes ranging from £25 to £1,000 instead of receiving
interest. With effect from November i960, the maximum prize was increased to £5,000.
By 31st August, i960, about £279 million had been invested in this form of savings.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and most of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the National
Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees for the repay¬
ment of the money so invested, with accrued interest, as and when required. In certain
circumstances, Trustee Savings Banks also accept deposits of up to £2,000 for special
investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly higher rate of interest
than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision of the National Debt
Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to the trustees for the repay¬
ment of these investments. In November 1959, there were about 1,330 Trustee
Offices controlled by 83 independent banks.
The Post Office Savings Bank is the largest organisation of its kind in the world. It
has over 22 million active accounts; in December 1959, total balances, which carry a
Government guarantee, amounted to £1,681 million, about £75 per depositor. Through
a centralised system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or make a withdrawal
at any one of some 20,000 post offices throughout the country.
There is a limit of £5,000 on the total balance which may be held by one individual
in the ordinary departments of Trustee Savings Banks and in the Post Office Savings
Bank. The maximum amount of National Savings Certificates which may be held by
any one person is £900 worth of the current (tenth) issue, in addition to holdings of
previous issues, and £800 worth of Premium Savings Bonds. The limit on individual
holdings of the current issue of Defence Bonds (5 per cent) is £5,000; this is in addition
to holdings of previous issues. By May i960, national savings had reached a record
total of over £7,000 million, and covered one-quarter of the National Debt.
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department about
the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in banking was legally
defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1876. The primary purpose
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to serve the co-operative movement,
whose financial centre it has become, but the bank has also come to include among
its clients trade unions and other mutual societies, local authorities and individual
depositors. The bank’s headquarters are in Manchester.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly provided
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, hire-purchase finance companies,
the Stock Exchange, Investment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market.
The firms engaged in such activities are in the main highly specialised, e.g., discount
houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers. Another type of
financial institution, the merchant bank, has been of great importance in the finance
of trade and commodity dealings and in the flotation of major issues of bonds, particularly
for overseas concerns and governments.
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
development purposes floated on the London market earned for Britain a continuing
flow of interest and attracted a steady flow of orders for British goods and products.
This increasing trade and also a large proportion of trade between foreign
countries was usually financed by bills of exchange, which were accepted as payable
at maturity by the merchant banks (also known as accepting houses) and were
traded on the discount market, thus providing an easy method of transferring debts
and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury bills and
other short-term securities. In recent years, commercial bills have become a small
proportion of the discount market’s business, while dealings in short-term bonds and
Treasury bills have increased considerably. Tenders for Treasury bills are invited by
the Government each week and the firms which comprise the discount market acquire
the bulk of their Treasury bills in this way. They finance the purchase of the bills
and securities they hold, chiefly by loans from the banks; about half of these loans
come from the London clearing banks, and most of the remainder from other United
Kingdom and overseas banks. In the main these loans and deposits may be called
in at any time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held until they become
of a currency required by the banks.
The Bank of England acts as lender of last resort to the 12 members of the London
Discount Market. The clearing banks do not borrow money directly from the Bank of
England; if they need to add to their cash resources they call in part of their loans to
the Discount Market. If, as a result, any particular discount house is unable to cover
its needs for cash elsewhere, it is obliged to borrow from the Bank of England,
normally at bank rate.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the Industrial
and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 to assist in dealing
with the problems of post-war reconstruction and development. Although the Govern¬
ment displayed considerable interest in their formation, the corporations themselves
are ordinary limited companies with no official representation on their boards and
having no recourse to public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth
Development Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 to assist develop¬
ment projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note are
the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, and the Scottish Agricultural
Securities Corporation Limited.
Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major industries with a view
to promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of
employment.
FINANCE
413
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may borrow up to
four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of ^125 million. The share
capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies, 30 per cent by trust
companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. As at 31st March, i960, the
capital called and paid up was 2 per cent (£500,000); the Bank of England paid up to
£5 million in advance of call in 1958-59. The liability of the shareholders in respect
of the uncalled capital represents security to the banks providing loans for the
corporation’s working capital.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
e.g., steel, oil, chemicals, shipping, diesel engines, and electrical components.
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its main
object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan capital and share capital
for industrial and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where
the existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are
not readily or easily available.
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC is £15 million, fully paid up.
In addition, the corporation can borrow up to a further £30 million in the form of
loan capital, and can thus have a maximum of £45 million available. Although the
Bank of England has a token participation, the principal shareholders are the London
clearing banks and the Scottish banks in proportion to their size; the loan capital is
provided by all the shareholders in the same ratio as their shareholdings.
The corporation’s function is to provide finance in sums ranging between £5,000
and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has over 650 customers and
has established branches in Birmingham, Leeds, Leicester, Manchester, Cardiff and
Edinburgh.
Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as a new
channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth development schemes.
Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which about 14^ million A ordinary
shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial, shipping, mining and banking interests
in the United Kingdom, and nf million ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (10s. paid) are
held by the Bank of England and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. At
the end of March i960, its commitments amounted to the sterling equivalent of
approximately £16-2 million.
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited
The primary function of this corporation, which was established in 1928, is to
grant long-term loans against first mortages on agricultural lands and buildings
in England and Wales. The share capital was subscribed by the Bank of England
and other banks, but the funds are mainly derived from public issues of debentures,
of which about £36 million was outstanding in March i960.
The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited
This corporation was established in 1933 under the provisions of the Agricultural
Credits (Scotland) Act, 1929. Its share capital is subscribed by three Scottish banks.
It fulfils broadly similar functions in Scotland to those of the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation in England.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important and is one of the world’s two foremost
free markets in securities.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stocks or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers. Some 10,000 securities are quoted on the
London Stock Exchange; at the end of 1959, these had a total market value of ^37,670
million.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned. All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct
which they formulate themselves.
Controls over Borrowing
Since 1932, there has been some degree of control over capital issues and other
forms of large-scale borrowing in the United Kingdom. The 1932 controls, and such
modifications as were made up to 1939, were without a statutory basis but resulted
from public requests by the Chancellor which the various markets observed. During
the war, a Capital Issues Committee was given the task of advising the Treasury
on the administration of the statutory control of capital issues (and analogous
transactions).
Ihe end of the war in 1945 saw the retention of the Capital Issues Committee with
its primary function unchanged; provision for capital issues control on a more
permanent basis was made the following year with the passing of the Borrowing
(Control and Guarantees) Act, 1946, which empowered the Treasury to make orders
regulating borrowing and the raising of money by the issue of shares.
In February 1959, controls over capital issues were considerably relaxed by a
general consent given by the Treasury, under powers conferred by the Control of
Borrowing Order, 1958. With the exception of redeemable bonus issues, it is no longer
necessary for any person or company resident in the United Kingdom to apply
individually for Treasury consent before borrowing money in Great Britain or before
issuing shares or other securities. Issues exceeding ^50,000 by overseas borrowers are
still subject to control by the Treasury and the timing of all issues of ^1 million or
more must be approved by the Bank of England.
Investment Trusts and Unit Trusts
Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks and
obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company, registered
under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is to invest its capital
in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it may issue several types
of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to build up reserves. Investment
trusts grew to importance in the latter half of the nineteenth century and have been
prominent in directing capital towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company and
a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the management company
buys a block of stock exchange securities spread over several companies in certain
sectors of the economy and re-sells them to the general public in the form of units
FINANCE
415
or sub-units. The price at which the sub-units are sold includes a service charge
which represents the remuneration of the managers of the trust. Fixed trusts are
composed of investments which are determined in advance and which may not be
changed. In flexible trusts, on the other hand, the managers may widen the field of
investment and change the investments as they judge desirable.
Although the first unit trust appeared in London in 1868, it was not until about
1931 that unit trusts became important. The Prevention of Fraud (Investments)
Act, 1939, amended by the Companies Act, 1947, and consolidated in the Prevention
of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1958, brought unit trusts under the control of the Board
of Trade. During the last few years unit trusts have grown rapidly. By the end of 1959,
the total funds invested in unit trusts amounted to about ^200 million, having doubled
in one year.
The Insurance Market
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by Provident Societies, most
insurance services in the United Kingdom are in the hands of either mutual or joint
stock companies or associations of underwriters (of which the most impoitant is
Lloyd’s).
Table 28 shows the distribution of business in terms of gross premium income in

are collected at frequent intervals of two months or less by house to house collection. It is con¬
ducted by both provident societies (called collecting societies) and companies, the latter account¬
ing for a gross premium income of £146 million out of a total of £17? million in 195 .
Insurance Companies
There are about 300 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom but
most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most United Kingdom
insurers write several of the main classes of business although some specialise in one
class, particularly in life assurance where about 40 companies write only that type of
business. A few specialise in reinsurance.
In addition over 100 overseas companies carry on business (and even more companies
are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the international nature of
the market. The natural centre of the market is in London, but some of the large
companies have their administrative headquarters elsewhere.
416
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1958 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies amounted to
£4,821 million and of this some £3,900 million were life funds. With the growth of
group pension schemes the rate of accumulation of life funds is increasing greatly.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance funds and
these represent one of the most important sources of funds for investment in commerce
and industry. More than a third of the total assets of British insurance companies
are invested in equity shares and debentures, and this proportion is gradually increasing.
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. Although in its earlier
history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, during the last sixty years there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very
considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance
business, except life assurance of which the amount transacted at Lloyd’s is negligible.
In addition to its insurance activities, Lloyd’s maintains a world-wide organisation
for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence).
The name ‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in
the late seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Lloyd’s
coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business and of
intelligence about shipping movements. In 1871, Lloyd’s was incorporated by Act
of Parliament.
The conduct of insurance business and the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its
corporate capacity are administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s.
The interests of a holder of a Lloyd’s policy are safeguarded in the following ways:
(1) every Lloyd’s underwriter is liable for his underwriting debts to the full extent
of his means and is required to lodge security by way of a deposit with the Committee
of Lloyd’s; (2) the whole of the premiums received by an underwriter must be placed
in a trust fund to be used exclusively for the payment of his underwriting liabilities
and expenses, and only ascertained profits can be released to the underwriter and then
only with the consent of the trustees; and (3) every underwriter must submit his
accounts to an annual audit.
The usual practice of underwriters today is to form themselves into groups known
as syndicates which generally specialise in particular branches of insurance. The
underwriters forming the syndicate appoint an agent who is empowered to accept
risks on their behalf and to control all matters concerned with the syndicate’s business.
If the insurance is for a relatively large amount, several syndicates may participate,
but each underwriter is individually liable only for the proportion of the risk accepted
on his behalf.
Underwriters may not accept business directly from the public, but must transact
through Lloyd’s brokers in London, who must be connected with Lloyd’s, either as
members or subscribers.
The annual premium income of Lloyd’s underwriters after deduction of brokerages,
commissions, returns and reinsurance premiums is about £233 million, of which some
£96 million is in respect of marine and aviation insurance.
Insurance Brokers
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of
the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part
of the company market. Many brokers specialise in reinsurance business, acting as
FINANCE 417
intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between companies, both British and
overseas, and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
International Insurance Services
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business comes from
abroad, partly by direct placing in London and partly from branches and agencies
established in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business
is that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use
in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very substantial
assets of the companies in addition to substantial reserves of uncalled capital and the
whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and personal fortunes of Lloyd’s
underwriters.
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling houses purchased for owner occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The Building Societies Act, i960, provides for the regulation of the type of
advances a building society may make, the investment of surplus funds, and the content
of advertisements used to attract funds from the public. The funds of building societies
are derived mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares are not dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may
be withdrawn in cash if notice is given. The rapid expansion of building society
activity in the twentieth century has been accompanied by a concentration of most of
the business in the hands of a few very large societies. At the end of 1959, 732 societies
were in operation, with total assets of £2,902 million. The amount advanced on
mortgage in 1959 was £518 million.
Under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, the Treasury was empowered
to make advances to building societies which fulfilled certain requirements as regards
assets and liabilities, liquid funds, reserves and other matters. These advances are for
relending to prospective house purchasers in respect of houses built before 1st January,
1919, which do not exceed £2,500 in value.
XIII. TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for only 2 per cent of the world’s
population, the United Kingdom conducts 10 per cent of international trade. It
has acquired this position as a consequence of several factors. It was one of the earliest
countries to remove legal ana fiscal restrictions on the internal movement of persons
and goods, and the first to develop adequate facilities for the movement of large
quantities of goods by mechanical transport (canals, roads, railways and steamships).
With its resources of coal and iron, and its succession of mechanical inventions,
Britain was also the first country to industrialise on a large scale and to produce a
wide variety of consumer goods in large quantities. In addition, Britain evolved, over
a long period of years, the specialised financial services essential for the smooth
functioning of overseas trade.
This chapter outlines some of the main features of Britain’s overseas trade and
payments and of its internal trade and includes only a brief treatment of its trade policy
and commercial relations.
OVERSEAS TRADE
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in international
trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of manufactures entering
into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of world imports was somewhat
larger than that of world exports, as imports into Britain were paid for not only by
exports of goods but by interest on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping
and a variety of financial services. Even before i9I4» howTever, this supremacy was
being increasingly challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United
States, and although Britain s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937, Britain’s share in
world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to 22 per cent compared
with 24 per cent in 1929 and 30 per cent in i9I4- In ^he years immediately following
the second world war, Britain’s share rose again and in 1950 wras 25 per cent; but by
1959 it had fallen to 17 per cent.
For over a century, Britain’s internal economy has been vitally dependent on
international trade. Britain relies upon imports for half its total consumption of
foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries. Its exports
of goods represent about 30 per cent of the output of manufacturing industry; exports of
goods and services together absorb about a fifth of the gross national product.
In I959> Britain was the world’s second largest trading nation. It is a major supplier
of machinery, ships, road and railway vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, chemicals
and textiles. Britain is the world s largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest
for metals, cotton, wool, petroleum and many other products.
PATTERN OF TRADE
Changes since 1938 in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution
of imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
418
TRADE
419
Value and Volume
Imports rose in value from ^9I9 million in 1938 to ,£1,802 million in 1947 and
£3,990 million in 1959. The rise in value of exports was from £471 million in 1938
to £1,142 million in 1947 and £3,330 million in 1959.
Calculations of changes in trade volume (i.e. changes after eliminating variations
due to price movements) compared with pre-war cannot be made with precision, as
the relative values of different types of goods on which the volume figures are based
have changed considerably since 1938. It has been estimated that in 1959 the volume
of imports was some 10 per cent greater than the 1938 figure, while the volume of
exports was about twice that of 1938. Statistics showing the value and volume of
imports and exports in 1938 and in selected post-war years are set out in Table 29.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL FIANDBOOK
The increased importance of exports in the national economy is indicated by the
rise in the proportion of total national income derived from export earnings—from
ii per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent in 1948 and 19 per cent in 1959. Over the same
period there was little change in the proportion of expenditure on imports to gross
national expenditure; it was about 16 per cent in 1938, 17 per cent in 1948 and
17 per cent in 1959.
Commodity Composition
The diagrams below give an analysis of the commodity composition of imports
and exports in 1959.
As domestic output of agriculture has expanded by about 70 per cent compared
with pre-war, Britain relies relatively less than before the war on food imports. Industrial
output has increased by some 80 per cent and a relatively larger supply of imported

raw materials is needed. Whereas 47 per cent by value of total imports in 1938 con¬
sisted of food, beverages and tobacco, the proportion in 1948 was only 42 per cent, and
in 1959, 38 per cent. On the other hand, the proportion for basic materials rose from
26 per cent in 1938 to 31 per cent in 1948, but was reduced to 23 per cent in 1959.
Imports of manufactures in 1959 were over 26 per cent of total imports, compared
with 31 per cent in 1938. Imports of fuels rose from 5 per cent of the total in 1938
to 12 per cent in 1959, due to increased consumption of petroleum products.
Compared with before the war, exports of engineering products have more than
doubled in importance relative to United Kingdom exports as a whole and in 1959
accounted for 44-1 per cent of the total. Within this group the increase in the relative
importance of exports of motor vehicles has been particularly marked. The share of
chemicals also shows an increase, from 6-3 per cent in 1935-38 to 8-8 per cent in 1959.
On the other hand, the share of textiles declined from 24 per cent in 1935-38 to 8-7
per cent in 1959. In the fuels group, exports of petroleum have partially replaced those
of coal. Further details of the percentage composition of United Kingdom exports
are set out in Table 30.

In 1959, the Commonwealth provided a market for rather more than two-fifths
of exports of United Kingdom goods, while the six countries of the European Economic
Community or Common Market (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands
and Western Germany) took 14 per cent, the United States 11 per cent, the Middle
East (including members of the sterling area) 6 per cent and Latin America 5 per
cent. The other members of the European Free Trade Association (see p. 425) accounted
for slightly over 10 per cent of United Kingdom exports.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
From a longer term standpoint, one of the most important trends is the growth of
exports to industrial countries, and particularly to the United States and Canada. The
sterling area provides a higher proportion of United Kingdom imports than pre-war,
although there has been a slight decline in the latter part of the past decade. The
expansion of oil consumption has been a major factor in the increasing imports from
the Middle East. In Western Europe, there has been a sharp rise in recent years
in trade with Western Germany, which has become the most important British market
there. About one-quarter of both exports and imports relate to trade with Western
Europe.
Re-Export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported (i) in the condition in which they are
imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—-e.g., simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds of
years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade, though, over the past 45
years, its importance relative to total United Kingdom export trade has declined. The
greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade has always been in raw materials and
foodstuffs, e.g., wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and fur-skins. Recently, a
considerable re-export trade has developed in machinery, notably aero-engines, which
have undergone repair and maintenance in the United Kingdom. A large part of the
re-export trade is in commodities imported from Commonwealth countries and
re-exported to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports such as tea
and wool.
In 1959, the total value of re-exports was £130 million and the principal items were:
rubber, fur-skins, raw wool, tea, non-ferrous metals, beverages and aeroplane engines.
Invisible Transactions
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom normally imports more goods than
it exports; the gap is, as a rule, more than covered by net earnings from invisible
transactions. Table 32 provides statistics of the receipts, payments and net earnings
of invisible transactions, divided for statistical purposes into six main groups:
Government; shipping; interest, profits and dividends; travel; migrants’ funds; and
other items. Some of these figures are precise (e.g., for Government transactions),
others are estimates.
Under the heading of Government current transactions, the main items on the
debit side are military expenditure overseas and grants to the Colonies and for relief
and other similar purposes. Shipping receipts come mostly from liners, and include
earnings from export freights and cross trades between other countries and also from
passenger traffic. Shipping payments, on the other hand, arise mainly on account of
tramp shipping services.
About three-fifths of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits and
dividends come from investments in the sterling area; the returns from these invest¬
ments are closely linked to movements in the prices of primary commodities. On
the debit side, major items include interest paid on sterling held by overseas countries
and interest payments on long-term loans from Canada and the United States.
Receipts from travel have increased greatly since 1950, reflecting the growing
importance of the British tourist industry (see p. 423). The largest component under
‘other items (net)’ is the overseas transactions of United Kingdom oil companies
(this does not include United Kingdom oil imports and exports, oil for the armed forces
overseas and capital items, which come under other sections of the accounts). Other

major items are: payments and receipts in respect of insurance, civil aviation and films;
expenditure of United States and Canadian forces in Britain; net earnings of merchants;.
and royalties, commissions, banking and other services.
Tourist Trade
The tourist industry is now one of Britain’s largest earners of foreign currency. Over
the period 1951—59, earnings from the foreign tourist trade and business travel
amounted to the equivalent of ^99° million, in addition to ^41^ million earned by
associated British shipping and air services. In i959> t°urist receipts from overseas
amounted to ^154 million. United Kingdom residents on holiday or travelling on-
business overseas spent about £176 million in the same year.
The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 1959 was i^o.ooo1—-
more than double the 1950 total and three times that of 1937* ^ was expected that
there would be 1^ million visitors in i960.
1 This total excludes tourists (other than aliens) from the Irish Republic and foreign visitors,
in transit to other destinations.
424
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Travel and Holidays Association, which is a grant-aided body, is con¬
cerned with the promotion of the tourist trade, particularly by means of publicity
overseas. It maintains offices in seven overseas countries and agencies and representa¬
tives in several others. The association was formed in April 1950 by the merger of
the British Travel and Holidays Board and the Travel Association.
CONDUCT OF TRADE
It has been a major aim of successive United Kingdom Governments since the
second world war to work for the removal of restrictions on trade and payments,
to reduce barriers to exports and, as far as possible, to restore the convertibility of
sterling. To this end, Britain has taken a leading part in setting up such organisations
as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC)
and the European Payments Union (now succeeded by the European Monetary Agree¬
ment), and has had a large share in these organisations’ activities, especially those to
free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the war and post-war periods.
In addition to substantial reductions in tariffs on imported goods, carried out
through the GATT, the United Kingdom has removed almost all its quota restrictions
on imports from countries with which it is in normal GATT relations. Towards the
end of 1959 and early in i960, most of those still remaining were lifted. These measures
followed a series of relaxations, mainly affecting goods from the dollar area, which
had been made over the two previous years. There is a short list of goods on which
import controls remain. It includes some items of special difficulty and a few where
restrictions are recognised internationally, such as arms, ammunition and radioactive
materials.
Tariff Policy
In the nineteenth century the United Kingdom became strongly attached to the
principle of free trade, and at the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs
duties were those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. During
the first world war, certain duties (the McKenna duties) were introduced to discourage
imports of motor cars, musical instruments, clocks and watches and cinematographic
film. These were continued after the war. Certain key industries, notably optical and
scientific instruments and fine chemicals, were given protection for strategic reasons
under an Act passed in 1921. In 1925, duties were imposed, for revenue purposes, on
imported silk, artificial silk and articles containing these materials. It was not until 1932,
however, that any serious departure was made from the principle of free trade.
Under the Import Duties Act of that year, the United Kingdom imposed a duty of
10 per cent ad valorem on all imported goods except those on a Free List (mainly
important raw materials and foodstuffs) and set up machinery for the imposition of
additional duties and for additions to be made to the Free List where appropriate.
This measure provided a degree of protection for British industry and, at the same
time, a basis for negotiations with foreign countries already in possession of a tariff
structure.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United Kingdom
customs tariffs in 1919 and, as a result of the Ottawa Conference in 1932, agreements
were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries providing for reciprocal
preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of goods. The Import Duties Act had
already permitted the duty-free entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
TRADE
425
A series of bilateral trade negotiations with other countries between 1932 and
1939 resulted in some modification in the level of protection and in the Commonwealth
preferences which had been established. During the second world war, because of
Government purchase and import control, protection by the tariff was of relatively
minor importance, and it was only after the substantial relaxation of quantitative
import controls in 1949 that the tariff again became an effective instrument of protection.
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified
as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under the auspices of the
GATT, which permits the retention of existing preferences, but prohibits the creation
of new ones. The United Kingdom has, however, obtained certain limited waivers from
the GATT no-new-preference rule; these permit, under certain conditions, increased
tariff protection for United Kingdom industries while preserving duty-free commit¬
ments for Commonwealth goods, and allow increased preferences for the benefit of
Colonial products wholly or mainly dependent on the United Kingdom market. In the
negotiations under the GATT, United Kingdom customs duties have been reduced,
or bound against increase, on goods which account for about half of Britain’s normal
imports from other contracting countries, in return for concessions by those countries.
Margins of preference have thereby been reduced in some instances, but only in
return for compensating tariff concessions by other countries, and only after consultation
with all the Commonwealth countries concerned.
The United Kingdom Government in February 1957 put forward proposals under
which the six countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy and
Western Germany) which in March 1957 signed the Treaty of Rome, establishing
the European Economic Community (EEC), and other members of OEEC, would
be associated in a free trade area covering industrial products in Europe. Negotiating
machinery for this purpose was set up by OEEC and, in October 1957, OEEC made a
unanimous declaration of intent to form such an area. By November 1958, however,
no agreement had been reached and the negotiations were suspended.
During 1959, seven members of OEEC—Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom—agreed to establish between them¬
selves a European Free Trade Association (EFT. A) with the object of reducing trade
barriers in Europe and establishing a bridge between the EEC and the other members
of OEEC. A convention was initialled in Stockholm in November 1959 an(^ ratified
by member countries in the early months of i960. Under it, customs tariffs on trade in
industrial products between members of EFTA will be reduced by stages over a ten-
year period. The first reduction, one of 20 per cent, took effect from 1st July, i960.
Two Acts of recent years have affected tariff policy. The Customs Duties (Dumping
and Subsidies) Act, 1957, empowers the Board of T rade to impose duties on imported
goods of any description which have been dumped or subsidised. The Import Duties
Act, 1958, replaced the existing legislation relating to the protective tariff (i.e. iour
main Acts and some 70 Finance Act provisions) and brought it up to date in a single
measure. Following the passing of the Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally
agreed form (the Brussels Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January, I959’
Methods of Trading
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry,
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, especially
of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in the
426
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers abroad’
through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries concerned; in
other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations
or subsidiary sales companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more
convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, commission
agents, and the representatives of overseas firms.
In the immediate post-war years, nearly all the principal imported foods and
raw materials and some other goods were bought wholly or mainly on Government
account, and the Government was also the sole purchaser of nearly all domestically
produced food and certain raw materials such as flax and timber. In later years, and
particularly since 1951, private trading has been restored to each commodity. Since
January 1957, overseas trading undertaken directly by the Government has been
confined to jute goods. The purpose of this control is to assist the United Kingdom
jute industry, which is concentrated in Dundee and still forms the mainstay of
employment in that city.
CONTROLS ON TRADE AND PAYMENTS
During the war and in the difficult economic circumstances of the post-war period, a
large number of restrictions on the movement of goods and services and on payments
were imposed. Most of these have been progressively abolished. The following section
gives a short account of the controls still in force.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, which includes, inter alia, control over the purchase and sale of
gold and foreign currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September
1939. The legal basis was, at first, the Defence (Finance) Regulations, issued under the
Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, but in 1947 most of these temporary war-time
powers were embodied in permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act, 1947.
At present, exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents
of the sterling area and residents outside it, and in the past few years, and especially
since 1954, these controls have been greatly relaxed. Since the end of December 1958,
residents of all countries outside the sterling area can settle transactions between
themselves in sterling. Sterling held by non-residents of the sterling area on an
external account is freely convertible into other currencies, including dollars. The
only remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital from the
United Kingdom to non-sterling countries.
Exports of goods to destinations outside the sterling area are subject to exchange
control and, in general, these have to be paid for within six months in an acceptable
currency or by sterling from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports,
to ensure that currency authorised for their payment is, in fact, used for that purpose.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the adminis¬
tration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the Treasury;
and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks a wide
variety of powers to deal with applications.
Overseas Travel
Restrictions in various forms on the amount of currency and notes that United
Kingdom travellers might take abroad were in force from the end of the war until
TRADE
427
November 1959, when new arrangements were introduced. The position in i960 is
as follows: there is no limit on the amount of foreign currency that United Kingdom
residents may obtain; a bank or authorised travel agency will supply up to £250 in
foreign currency in any one year to each traveller for purposes of travel outside the
scheduled territories (sterling area); if an amount exceeding ^250 is required, this
may be authorised by the Bank of England on application being made through the
traveller’s bank. Reference is made to the Bank of England as a protection against
the unauthorised export of capital and not to limit the amount available for travel.
Travellers may take up to £50 in sterling notes and £250 in foreign currency notes
without formality.
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export
of goods. The powers of both import and export control derive from the same legislation,
but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
Import Licensing
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the IMF,
the United Kingdom Government has, as the balance of payments has permitted,
progressively removed restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the
free world. This policy is carried out by means of Open General Licences, which
from time to time are granted by the Board of Trade by virtue of powers vested in
them under the 1939 Act.
Goods still subject to control require a specific import licence and quotas have been
set up for most of these goods. Some quotas refer specifically to individual countries
and are usually shared out among exporters by the authorities of the countries con¬
cerned. Others are accorded on an overall or global basis; these are generally allocated
by the United Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually on the
basis of their share of the trade in the commodity in the past.
Export Controls
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner (see p. 4.26), United Kingdom
exports are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any Government control or
direction. Goods are freely exportable to all destinations unless there is a specific ban on
their export without licence. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to
supervise exports of military and strategic importance, to conserve materials, such as
metal scrap, which may be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange control operations
in preventing the export of capital in the form of valuable goods, and to prevent the
export of works of art classed as national treasures, such as paintings, manuscripts
and antiques.
Normally, individual licences are required for specific consignments of goods
subject to export licensing control, but, in a few cases, Open General Licences are
issued. In other cases, bulk licences are issued to permit exports of specified quantities
of controlled goods within a given period.
Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category of atomic
energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may be exported to the
Commonwealth, the Irish Republic and the United States of America without
licence.

GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO OVERSEAS TRADE
The United Kingdom Government does not subsidise exports, but supplies informa¬
tion, advice and practical assistance (including credit insurance facilities) to exporters1
and seeks to create conditions in which export trade can flourish. Its general economic
policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures to maintain a stable economy
and to control excessive demand for goods and services by the home market, and action
through international negotiation to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and to
move towards the freest possible system of trade and payments.
Information and Advice to Exporters
The Government department most concerned in export promotion is the Board of
Trade, which calls upon the assistance of overseas representatives. At each Embassy
or Legation there is always an officer of high rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First
Secretary (Commercial), who specialises in commercial matters. These officers direct
the commercial activities of consular officers in their respective territories. At important
centres in the Commonwealth there are Trade Commissioners, who are directly
responsible to the Board of Trade.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions,
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome the difficulties he encounters in trade with the country
in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations. These officers
indicate potential demand for United Kingdom products, advise about methods of
trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on all opportunities for export
business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods. Assistance is also given to United
Kingdom exporters in appointing agents and locating potential importers. From records
kept in London, brought up to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export
Services Branch of the Board of Trade can provide information concerning any
country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) local tastes and preferences in design; and
(5) the probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates
entering into business relations.
Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, responsible directly to the President
of the Board of Trade, is run on commercial lines to provide insurance for United
Kingdom exporters and merchants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in
overseas trading. These facilities have been developed over a period of more than
thirty years, and the department now underwrites nearly £700 million worth of
insurance a year; this sum represents about 18 per cent of the total United Kingdom j
export trade. The department is obliged to conduct its business on a self-supporting

Northern Ireland Development Council, and the Development Corporation for Wales, see p. 257.
TRADE 429
basis, taking one year with another, and cannot therefore be regarded in any way as a
provider of subsidies to exporters.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, govern¬
mental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the United Kingdom
exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions in the buyer’s country,
war between the buyer’s country and the United Kingdom, cancellation or non¬
renewal of a United Kingdom export licence, or ‘any other cause of loss occurring
outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the exporter or the buyer,
and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from
the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Short-term policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to six months’
credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the whole of his trade
with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve months (or, in some cases,
three years) covered by his policy. For certain engineering goods this type of
cover is extended to goods sold on maximum credit terms of up to five years.
Cover is also available for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom
merchant to third countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct
United Kingdom exports.
2. Medium-term policies which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms exceeding three years. Specific policies are negotiated for each individual
contract.
In the case of all the department’s policies, the exporter or merchant is required
to retain an interest in the debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are
given up to a maximum of between 85 and 95 per cent. Premium rates are assessed
separately for each country, and vary according to the risks and the terms of payment.
Cover is also available for United Kingdom concerns carrying out services for overseas
firms or, under certain conditions, entering into an international consortium.
Under the Export Guarantees Acts, 1949 to 1957* t^e Government has powers to
give economic assistance to other countries.
Trade Fairs
An inquiry carried out by the Federation of British Industries (FBI) in 1957 showed
that the large majority of British trade associations favoured the development of
specialised fairs, concentrating on the products of a particular industry or group of
industries, rather than the general fair at which wide ranges of products are exhibited.
Over 60 specialised fairs are held every year in the United Kingdom and the number
is growing steadily. An increasing proportion, at present about half the total, are
international in character, and the remainder are national (i.e. open only to firms
showing United Kingdom products). A list of the more important ones appears
regularly in the fairs section of the Board of Trade Journal. Some of the specialised
fairs, such as the Motor Show and the Radio and Television Show, attract large
numbers of the public as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas, and
provide an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufactures are shown at most of the large international trade
fairs throughout the world. For example, the products of more than 360 United
Kingdom firms were exhibited at the i960 Milan Fair; the United Kingdom is always
well represented at the Hanover and Posnan Fairs. In addition to these international
events at which British goods are shown, there are, from time to time, specially
43°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
organised displays of British products. Through a subsidiary company, British Overseas
Fairs Ltd., the FBI organised British Trade Fairs in Baghdad in 1954, in Copenhagen
in I955>in Helsinki in 1957 and in Lisbon in 1959; and in i960, it was responsible for
the comprehensive all-British exhibition in New York. At the Brussels Universal and
International Exhibition, held in 1958, the FBI organised a highly successful British
Industries Pavilion. United Kingdom manufacturers have been prominent at the many
important specialised international fairs which are held in North America and Europe.
As well as collecting and distributing information on trade fairs, the Board of Trade
aids British industry by installing trade inquiry stands at certain major overseas fairs.
These are usually combined with displays designed to show one or more aspects of
British industrial production. In addition, the Board of Trade sometimes collaborates
with trade associations in organising joint displays of the products of a particular
industry at overseas specialised fairs.
Dollar Exports Council
In December 1951, the Dollar Exports Council replaced the Dollar Exports Board,
which had been established in June 1949 by representatives of United Kingdom
industry, trade, finance and organised labour, with the approval and support of the
United Kingdom Government. It is an independent, self-governing, voluntary
organisation whose purpose is to give all possible service to exporters from the United
Kingdom to Canada and to the United States.
BRITAIN’S ROLE IN THE FINANCING OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE
By a process of evolution through the centuries, the United Kingdom has developed
an efficient and adaptable organisation of trade and financial services, centred mostly
on London, and capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain itself, but of the world
in general. Britain’s supremacy in this respect derives from a number of factors—
historical, geographical and economic—as well as the technical efficiency and low cost
of its services. In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, com¬
merce and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain the
market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for the chief world
markets in raw materials (see below), freight, insurance, and precious metals. At the
same time, British capital was invested in overseas countries to assist their development,
increase their output and exports, and provide markets for manufactured goods.
London became the chief supplier of capital for many Commonwealth and foreign
governments and a centre for entrepot trade proceeding to and from the growing
industrial areas on the continent of Europe and in North America. In course of time,
the pound sterling and the sterling bill of exchange developed into the principal form
of money for transactions between one country and another in all parts of the world.
Side by side with these developments, a sound commercial banking system and a
flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions
such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular needs for
short-term or long-term finance (see pp. 408-415). The facilities provided by merchant
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of
goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries themselves.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic commodities.
Most of these markets were closed during the war but most, if not all, have now reopened
TRADE
431
and many have fully regained—some even surpassed—their previous position. Among
the more important are the Baltic Exchange (the market for shipping and air trans¬
port, grain, seeds and vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa,
coffee, copra, hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the
London Metal Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn
Exchange. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home consumption
but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers and sellers in other
countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is scarcely any product which
cannot be traded through an intermediary in the United Kingdom. For example,
London is the world’s most important philatelic market and also the leading international
centre for the sale of works of art.
The Foreign Exchange Market
The Foreign Exchange Market, which was closed during the wrar, was reopened
for forward dealings in December 1951 and for arbitrage dealings in currencies of
members of the European Payments Union in May 1953. The market is subject to
United Kingdom exchange control regulations governing the purchase and sale of
foreign currencies in the sterling area, but these regulations have been progressively
relaxed in recent years.
The market consists of authorised banks and brokers linked together by telephone
in the United Kingdom, and by telephone, telex and cable with overseas centres.
The London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak of war,
was reopened on a restricted basis in March i954> under the general supervision of
the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the world’s leading centre
for dealings in gold.
Authorised dealers in gold are now free to deal with residents outside the sterling
area against payment in any foreign currency, or in sterling held outside the sterling
area, but residents of the sterling area have access to the market only as sellers, except
where permission is given for the purchase of gold for essential industrial purposes and
for the jewellery trade.
The Sterling System
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several countries
tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for international transactions,
but also to maintain central currency reserves in Britain. When Britain abandoned the
gold standard in 1931 these countries, which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’
and later as the ‘sterling area’, did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates
to the pound sterling. In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no
longer freely convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more
formally defined as a currency area, for exchange control purposes. Within the sterling
area the United Kingdom imposes virtually no restrictions on payments, whether in
respect of current or of capital transactions.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada), together with Burma, Iceland,
the Irish Republic, Jordan, Libya and the British protected states in the Persian
Gulf, are members of the sterling area. These countries contain one-quarter of the
world’s population and do one-quarter of the world’s trade. The mam feature of
the sterling area is that the greater part of the overseas trade of member countries
is financed in sterling; they keep their foreign reserves large y in t e orm o ster ing
432
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and maintain a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member
countries for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange
for sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require. They
generally also sell gold in the London Market for sterling. The United Kingdom
reserves of gold and foreign currencies are held in the Exchange Equalisation Account,
which buys and sells exchange in the market as appropriate, and is a large buyer of
gold from the sterling area and elsewhere.
All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or centralised
rules of conduct, the Commonwealth member countries agreeing between themselves
at periodic conferences the broad policies to be followed for the strengthening of
sterling and of the reserves.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published half-yearly
m White Papers. These publications provide a summary of the whole range of the
United Kingdom’s transactions with other countries, classified by type of transaction
and by area.
The transactions fall into three main groups—current account, long-term capital
account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is composed of
the balance of visible trade (i.e. the difference between merchandise imports and exports
and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles (see p. 422). On long-term capital
account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental loans (including amortisation)
and other identified net long-term investment abroad by residents, or in the United
Kingdom by non-residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in
part the United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes identified
capital transactions not of a long-term character (e.g., changes in acceptances); changes
in overseas sterling holdings and in Britain’s credit or debit balance in the European
Payments Union (which, since 30th December, 1958, has been superseded by the
European Monetary Agreement); and changes in the central reserves of gold and
convertible currencies.
Table 33 gives details of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments in 1957,
1958 and 1959.
Balance of Payments in 1959
For 1959 as a whole, the United Kingdom had a surplus on current account of
£145 million. This was about £200 million less than in 1958, which was an exceptionally
favourable year. As is usual, there was a deficit on visible trade which was more than
balanced by invisible earnings. During i959> ne^- long-term capital investment was
very high and, at £548 million, was about ^290 million more than in 1958. By far the
largest item was the additional subscription of £232 million to the International
Monetary Fund. A further ^89 million wTas used in the advance repayments of the
I957 l°an from the Export-Import Bank; and ^29 million (net) in other governmental
loan operations. The reserves of gold and convertible currencies fell by a total of
j£ii9 million and the sterling holdings of countries in the rest of the sterling area
rose by ^184 million, reflecting the rise in their export earnings as a result of the
recovery in world trade.
Trends in Earlier Years
The main balance of payments problem for Britain has been to earn enough from
exports, visible and invisible, (1) to pay for half Britain’s food and nearly all the raw

needed in a world of multilateral trading and convertible currencies, and to meet
obligations overseas, including foreign debt service; and (3) to meet obligations
\ oluntarily accepted in respect of economic development in Commonwealth countries
and elsewhere.1
Between 1945 and 1951, the balance of payments on current account fluctuated
widely owing to several factors, including changes in the terms of trade, the devaluation
of the pound sterling in 1949, and the trade boom following the Korean War with its
aftermath of high import prices. From 1952 onwards, there have been surpluses in
each year except 1955, with an average annual surplus from 1956 to 19C9 of Sz-xo
million. * J
Regional Balance of Payments
There is normally a triangular pattern of trade between the United Kingdom,
the rest of the sterling area and the rest of the world. While the United Kingdom is
usually in current deficit with the non-sterling world, the rest of the sterling area
is usually in current surplus ; on the other hand, within the sterling area, the position is
reversed and the United Kingdom normally has a current surplus with other sterling
area countries.

In the early post-war years, the principal component in the United Kingdom’s
current deficit with the non-sterling world was the deficit with the dollar area. However,
since 1951, this deficit has been considerably reduced—from an average of £307
million in 1946-51 to an average of £65 million in 1952-58; and in 1959, there was a
current account surplus with North America of £143 million.
* In addition, since the war, the United Kingdom Government has had to meet heavy overseas
military expenditure.Un 1959, for example, this amounted to £174 million.

A ‘second line’ of reserves is provided by the United Kingdom’s drawing rights
in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to which Britain is the second largest
contributor. In May 1959, the United Kingdom paid £58 million in gold to the

External Financial Aid received by Britain
Britain’s difficulties in balancing its external accounts, particularly with the dollar
area, in the immediate post-war years, were greatly alleviated by aid received from the
United States and Canada.
In 1945, the United States extended to Britain a line of credit amounting to $3,750
million, and a loan of $650 million (later adjusted to $622 million) in settlement of
Lend-Lease and reciprocal aid adjustments arising out of the war. In 1946, Canada
also extended a line of credit, amounting to $C. 1,250 million, of which the United
Kingdom drew $C. 1,185 million. The terms of settlement with both countries
provided for payment in 50 annual instalments, starting on 31st December, 1951,
with interest at the rate of 2 per cent a year. The original loan agreements included
provision for waiver of interest under certain circumstances. In March 1957, these
were replaced by new arrangements whereby the United Kingdom Government
could defer up to seven of the annuity payments of both capital and interest if it judged
this postponement necessary in view of the current and prospective conditions of
international exchange and the level of the reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
Between 1948 and 1951, Britain received in all $2,700 million in Marshall Aid
from the United States under the European Recovery Programme. Of this, $1,700
million was grant aid, some $620 million was ‘conditional’ aid (i.e. dollar aid on
condition that Britain provided corresponding sterling aid to other European countries)
and $337 million was a loan to be repaid with interest at 2^ per cent. By far the greater
part of the Marshall Aid allocated to Britain was used to buy essential food and raw
materials; but technical assistance and help in promoting intra-European trade
co-operation were also provided.
After 1951, the financial aid received by Britain from the United States was mostly
under the provisions of the United States Mutual Defence Assistance Programme and
Mutual Security Programme. Between 1951 and 1958, when this form of aid was
terminated, net receipts by Britain amounted to $1,184 million, including a loan of
$48 million repayable with interest at 2J per cent. In 1956, the United Kingdom ceased
to be allocated any Mutual Security aid.
The Mutual Security Programme also assisted Britain’s dollar balance of payments
by the system of ‘offshore procurement’, under which the United States has placed ,
contracts in Britain for military goods to be supplied to other NATO countries.
Offshore sales to the United States Government totalled £12 million in 1959, compared
with ^40 million in 1957 and £18 million in 1958. United States and Canadian Forces’
expenditure in Britain in 1959 amounted to £65 million.
United States Private Investment in Britain
Since the war, the United Kingdom’s economy has benefited from the expansion
of United States corporate investment in Britain and the growth of licensing
arrangements between United Kingdom and United States companies.
It has been estimated1 that between 1950 and 1958 the total book value of United
States direct investments in Britain rose from $847 million to $2,058 million, repre¬
senting almost half the total United States direct investment in Western Europe over
1 United States Department of Commerce’s Survey of Current Business, August 1959.

the period. The 1958 total included $400 million in petroleum refining and distribu¬
tion and $1,313 million in manufacturing industry (chiefly motor vehicles and equip¬
ment, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, metals and food products). Much
of this investment is in expanding industries such as agricultural tractors, earth-
moving equipment and office machinery. This investment by United States industrial
firms has enabled the British economy to acquire some new techniques and to make
considerable savings in imports and at the same time to expand its exports of several
important products.
North American investors are also allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the sale
of these investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued, provided
that the investment was made after 1st January, 1950. Earned profits and dividends
can be transferred, irrespective of the amount; transfers of this kind have never been
restricted. Portfolio investment (e.g., by purchase, on a stock exchange, of securities
in United Kingdom companies) by United States citizens has also increased markedly
since 1957. As a result of the increasing interest in the United States in direct invest¬
ment in the United Kingdom, a British Industrial Development Office has been estab¬
lished in New York to provide potential investors with advice and information about
manufacturing conditions in the United Kingdom.
UNITED KINGDOM AID AND INVESTMENT OVERSEAS
For well over a hundred years the United Kingdom has been a major supplier of
external finance for other countries; up to the first decade of the twentieth century
it was the foremost supplier of private long-term capital. Since the second world
war, despite economic difficulties, the United Kingdom has made available to other
countries very large sums in the form of grants and loans for relief, rehabilitation,
development and other economic purposes.
In recent years, United Kingdom finance for overseas development has been made
available through private sources, public funds and intergovernmental organisations.
The greater part of such finance goes to Commonwealth countries (including Colonial
territories) and consists of private funds. There has also been substantial direct
or indirect governmental assistance to Colonial territories and to under-developed
countries inside and outside the Commonwealth.
All the countries of the sterling Commonwealth except the United Kingdom are
net importers of long-term capital and look to the United Kingdom for a substantial
proportion of their external capital requirements. The sources and availability o
capital for development are therefore regularly considered at Commonwealth Economic
Conferences and Meetings. At the Commonwealth Conference in Montreal in
September 1958, special emphasis was placed on the needs of the less developed
countries of the Commonwealth and the conference recognised that the Common¬
wealth has a collective responsibility to do what it can to promote development
in those areas.
Private Finance
Since the United Kingdom imposes no exchange control on current transactions
or capital payments with other sterling area countries, there are no precise figures
of total United Kingdom finance made available overseas. Balance of payments
figures show, however, that the net level of United Kingdom private investment in
all areas has been some £200 million a year in recent years. e gross out ow o
new funds has. however, been much larger and is estimated to have averaged
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
438
^300 million yearly since 1953. It is estimated that at least £100 million a year of
this private investment goes to under-developed countries.
This private investment abroad may take several forms: the raising of loans on the
London capital market; direct investment; the establishment of subsidiary companies;
the ploughing back of profits earned overseas; and participation, jointly with domestic
capital, in enterprises overseas.
London Market Borrowing
Because of the heavy demand for such funds, borrowing by overseas Governments
on the London capital market since the war has normally been confined to issues by
Commonwealth and Colonial Governments. New capital issues for Commonwealth
countries have averaged about £55 million a year since 1954.
Other Private Investment
The United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment in the sterling area by
United Kingdom firms. Such investment is frequently made from a firm’s existing
resources. However, borrowers outside the United Kingdom must normally obtain
the consent of the Treasury (which is advised by the Capital Issues Committee) if the
amount borrowed exceeds £50,000 in any one year. In 1954-59, capital issues destined
for sterling Commonwealth countries averaged over £50 million a year. Finance is
also made available by the Commonwealth Development Finance Company (see
P- 4I3)> which, by March i960, had entered into commitments totalling £16-2 million
in eleven Commonwealth countries for a wide variety of projects.
Finance from Public Funds
Non-military loans and grants to the under-developed countries from the United
Kingdom Exchequer have been increasing: figures are given in Table 35.

This assistance takes two forms: grants and loans, and payments for technical assis¬

contributions to international bodies (multilateral assistance). The annual division
of assistance between these various forms is shown for the three latest years in Table 36.
The amounts included represent entirely assistance to less developed countries, with
the exception of sums of £3-7 million in 1957-58, £2-2 million in 1958-59 and £3

Bank loans for which part of the United Kingdom subscription was used.

* These categories and the sums involved differ from the presentation given in the White
Papers on the United Kingdom balance of payments. These differences arise (a) because the
balance of payments’ estimates do not make a precise distinction between economic assistance
and other types of Government current expenditure, (b) because of timing (disbursements from
Exchequer funds are on a financial year basis), and (c) because some types of transactions included
as Exchequer aid do not enter into the balance of payments.
There are several public sources of finance from which United Kingdom funds
are made available for overseas development. The following are the principal forms
of machinery through which funds are provided.
Export Guarantees Acts
The Government has authority under Sections 2 and 3 of the Export Guarantees
Act, 1949, as amended by Section 2 of the Export Guarantees Act, i957> f°r
giving of economic assistance to countries outside the United Kingdom. Securities
issued by the borrowing country are acquired by the Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD), and their purchase price used to facilitate payment for United
Kingdom exports.
United Kingdom Government loans are made through these powers to overseas
Governments. The loans bear interest at rates related to the notional rates for United
Kingdom Government borrowing,

BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
From 1949 to 1958, loans have been effected through ECGD to Yugoslavia (£17
million), India (^43-5 million), Iran (£11 million), Pakistan (£10 million), and Iraq
(£2 million). Loans granted under this procedure between September 1958 and July
i960 totalled j£82-75 million. They included three to India (^28-5 million, £19 million
and £3 million) and others to Pakistan (£10 million), Nigeria (£12 million), the Sudan
(£5 million), Yugoslavia (£3 million) and Malaya (£2-25 million). Three further loans
have been approved in principle: to India (£10 million), Pakistan (£5 million) and
Ceylon (^2-5 million).
Colonial Development Corporation
The Colonial Development Corporation is a public corporation set up in February
1948 to assist Colonial territories in the development of their economies. The corpora¬
tion can borrow up to £150 million on a long-term and medium-term basis, and £\o
million on a short-term basis. Exchequer advances to the corporation outstanding at
any one time may not exceed £130 million long-term and medium-term advances.
At the end of 1959, the corporation reported that it had 88 continuing projects,
and a total capital commitment of nearly £115 million. The projects were divided up
as follows: utilities (power, transport, communications, housing) 45-2 per cent; primary
production (agriculture, minerals, forestry) 43-1 per cent; commerce and industry
(factories, hotels) 11-7 per cent.
Colonial Development and Welfare Acts
The United Kingdom has made available, under the Colonial Development and
Welfare Act of 1945 and subsequent Acts, £220 million for planned development
and welfare in its dependent territories for the period 1946-60. Under the Colonial
Development and Welfare Act, 1959, a further £95 million will be provided for the
period 1959-64 for the continuation of assistance on the existing basis. The 1959 Act
also provides for additional Exchequer loans of up X.o £100 million in the same period;
the maximum amount approved for any one year must not exceed £25 million. In the
financial year 1959-60, £33-4 million was issued as loans. These loans and grants are
used by the dependent territories to supplement development expenditure from their
own resources and from market borrowing.
Other Government Sources
United Kingdom Government funds are also made available for overseas purposes
in other ways than those mentioned above, e.g., grants and loans to assist the adminis¬
trations of certain dependent territories; in special circumstances, direct financial
assistance (other than loans under the Export Guarantees Acts) is provided for in¬
dependent Commonwealth and foreign Governments—examples are Malaya and Libya.
United Kingdom Aid through Intergovernmental Organisations
1 he principal intergovernmental organisations through which the United Kingdom
provides aid to other countries are the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
the United Nations Expanded Programme for Technical Assistance and Special
Fund for Technical Assistance, and (through private and public channels) the Colombo
Plan. After September i960, aid will also be provided through the International
Development Association (IDA).
1 he United Kingdom’s subscription to IBRD is the second largest of any country;
originally $1,300 million, it was increased to $2,600 million in September 1959 as
part of the general increase in the Bank’s capital in order to facilitate its borrowings in
capital markets.
TRADE
44I
In accordance with the rules of IBRD 2 per cent (about £9 million) of the original
subscription was paid in gold and dollars and is freely available for IBRD to lend to
any country while 18 per cent (about £84 million) was paid in sterling and can be lent
only with the United Kingdom’s permission. In fact, the United Kingdom gave
permission for ^4 million of this to be lent to any member country, and for the remain-
ing ,£8o million to be lent to Commonwealth countries; nearly all the 18 per cent
subscription had been disbursed by June i960. Repayments on loans financed in this
way may be used by IBRD for fresh lending, thus constituting a revolving fund.
In addition, IBRD has also borrowed ^20 million by the issue of bonds on the
London market.
The United Kingdom is to contribute the equivalent of $131 million to the capital
of the IDA, which is being set up under the auspices of the IBRD, to provide capital
on special terms for under-developed countries.
The United Kingdom is also the second largest contributor to IFC,1 and has
subscribed $14-4 million of the corporation’s total capital of $100 million. In addition,
the United Kingdom has contributed nearly £7! million to the United Nations
Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance2 and in i960 provided $5 million
towards the resources of the United Nations Special Fund.3
Colombo Plan
The Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-
East Asia had its origin in, and took its name from, the meeting of Commonwealth
Foreign Ministers held at Colombo in January 1950. It is designed to provide a frame¬
work within which a co-operative effort can be made to raise the area’s standards of
living and to undertake economic development.
The cumulative total of disbursements from the United Kingdom Exchequer to
Colombo Plan countries from 1951 to 31st March, i960, amounted to about £150
million (not including the sterling releases mentioned above or releases from the
United Kingdom’s sterling subscription to IBRD). This figure comprises disburse¬
ments from departmental votes; aid given under the Colonial Development and
Welfare Acts and from the Colonial Development Corporation to Malaya, North
Borneo and Sarawak; technical assistance; ECGD credits. In addition to the ,£150
million disbursements mentioned, some £30 million from the United Kingdom stood
committed at 1st April, i960.
The United Kingdom undertook, at the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee
meeting at Seattle in November 1958, to increase the amount of technical assistance
to be provided up to 1963 from £7 million to £9 million.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad categories:
trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle
components) and trade in consumer goods, that is to say goods for direct sale to the
public. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined in Chapter IX, The National
Economy.
1 IFC was set up as an affiliate of IBRD in 1956 to assist the growth of private enterprise in
member countries.
2 The object of this programme is to provide under-developed countries with expert advice
and training facilities over a wide field.
3 The object of the fund is to extend the scope and resources of the existing technical assistance
and development programmes of the United Nations.
442
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The 1957 Census of Distribution, which was a large-scale sample inquiry, provides
an account of the structure of retail trade. The full Census of Distribution, relating
to the year 1950, also covered wholesaling and the catering and other service trades,
and provides a comprehensive picture of the distributive trades as a whole. It also
included more detailed information on the retail trades than was given in the 1957
Census. Both censuses covered Great Britain but not Northern Ireland.
WHOLESALE TRADE
On the basis of some pre-war researches,1 it would appear that about 17 per cent
of sales were made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations,
including their own retail outlets and mail-order businesses, while more than 40 per
cent were accounted for by direct sales by producers to retailers; and it is estimated that
approximately a further 40 per cent of sales moved through wholesale channels.
These channels are most in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural
produce and foodstuffs. The 1950 Census returns, which covered about 92 per cent of
all wholesalers, showed a total employment of about 800,000 in wholesaling. Out of
a total of some 55,700 wholesale establishments, there were about 7,000 in the clothing,
footwear and textile trades, 6,900 in the groceries, confectionery and drink trades and
6,900 in other food trades.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fresh fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres or, in some cases, direct
to retailers; fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, may be sold by growers to
commission agents who dispose of the produce either to w holesalers or direct to retailers,
or alternatively the grower may deal only with wholesale firms.
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the distribution of
foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden handles about £75 million
wrorth of fruit, vegetables and flowers each year; nearly 8,000 tons of meat pass through
Smithfield market each week; Billingsgate is the principal distributing centre in
Britain for fish. Other markets in London include those at Leadenhall (poultry)
and Spitalfields (fruit and vegetables).
Voluntary wholesale chains, that is to say independent retailers linking themselves
to a single wholesaler or a group of wholesalers and so gaining some of the advantages
of large-scale trading without losing their independence, have developed quite rapidly
in the grocery trade since 1954. As yet, however, they account for only a small, though
growing, proportion of grocery business.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of Retail Shop
Retail shops in Britain may be classified under four heads: (1) retail co-operative
societies; (2) department stores with a number of departments selling different types
of goods (in some cases a firm may own several department stores); (3) multiple
traders, that is organisations, other than co-operative societies or department stores,
with ten or more branches; and (4) independent retail businesses and branches of small
multiple stores (i.e. chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). In addition, there
are a number of market and street traders but, according to the 1950 Census of

unofficial pioneer studies, for example, The Distribution of Consumer Goods, by James B. Jefferys,

trade in 1957, 590,000 were working proprietors and unpaid family helpers. Out of a
total of about 574,000 establishments shown by the 1957 Census, and recorded in Table

444 BRITAIN : AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Present Trends in Retail Trade
By 1959, total retail sales had advanced 7 per cent over the 1957 level. Within this
total, the multiple retailers continued to advance much more rapidly than the other
retailers, their 1959 sales being 15 per cent greater than in 1957, compared with increases
of 9 per cent for department stores, 4 per cent for independent retailers and 4 per cent
for co-operative societies. The rate of increase also varied commodity-wise, the durable
goods sector (furniture, radio and television, household appliances and cycles) showing
the largest advance, partly as a result of the lifting of hire purchase restrictions in
October 1958; in the year 1959 sales by durable goods’ shops were as much as 18
per cent greater than in 1957. Clothing and footwear shops’ sales showed an increase
of 4 per cent between 195? ant^ tQSQ* whole of their increase occurring in 1959,
while food shops’ sales advanced by 6 per cent, spread evenly over the two years. A
notable feature of 1959 was the stability of retail prices and with these showing virtually
no increase on 1958 almost the whole of the increase in the value of sales (4 per cent
over 1958) was attributable to a greater volume of sales.
Self-Service Shops and Mobile Shops
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has probably
helped the multiple stores and the retail co-operatives to achieve a higher rate of
expansion in sales. The number of self-service shops in the United Kingdom in i960
was probably over 6,000 and new self-service outlets are being established at the rate
of some 800 a year. About 60 per cent of these shops are thought to be owned by retail
co-operative societies and the majority of the remainder by multiple stores. On the
basis of returns provided for the 1957 Census of Distribution, the Board of Trade has
estimated that their total turnover in that year exceeded £200 million; unofficial
estimates for self-service trading put the 1959 rate of sales at some £340 million. Self-
service shops as a whole are now estimated to be responsible for about 15-16 per
cent of retail sales in the grocery and provision trade, but for other types of merchandise
the proportion is insignificant.
Supermarkets, which may be broadly defined as self-service shops with a selling
area of more than 2,000 square feet, have been operating since 1956 in the United
Kingdom. By i960, about 400 had been opened, nearly one-half of them in or around
the London area. Co-operative societies own nearly half of the supermarkets, and
multiple stores about two-fifths. It is estimated that new supermarkets are opening
at the rate of 100 a year.
There has also been a large increase in the number of mobile shops serving out-
lying housing estates and rural areas. Some 8,000 mobile shops, about half of which
are owned by retail co-operative societies, are estimated to be in operation, the
majority selling groceries or other foodstuffs; several manufacturers specialise in
building fully equipped vehicles for this type of trading.
Mail Order Sales
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling in the
United Kingdom in recent years. Retail sales amounting to £128 million were reported
by specialist mail order houses in 1957, compared with only ^47 million in 1950,
and some manufacturers and large stores also sell by mail order. The twenty largest
companies account for about 85 per cent of total mail order sales; the bulk of their
trade consists of clothing, footwear and household textiles. The smaller mail order
businesses normally specialise in a single commodity, notably in the sale by post of
seeds, plants and small horticultural requisites.
TRADE
445
Retail Co-operative Societies
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their customers.
An operating surplus is returned periodically to members as a dividend, and the
amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the member’s purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open to
anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the member to
an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of the society. Invest¬
ment by individual members is limited to £500 but the rules of some societies may
fix lower limits. Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of 1958, there were 1,015 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, but amalgamations are slowly diminishing
the number of societies. More than a quarter of the total membership of the co¬
operatives (12,594,000) was provided by the eleven largest societies, each of which
had a membership of more than 130,000. One, the London Co-operative Society
with about 1-3 million members, is the largest retail co-operative in the world. Total
sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1958 reached £998 million (this figure
includes certain activities not covered by the Census of Distribution figure in Table 37);
the largest society had a turnover of more than £50 million, and of the total trading
surplus, £50 million was allocated to dividends on sales.
Retail co-operative societies are free to purchase where they wish or to produce
their own goods, but in order to secure the advantages of large-scale production and
distribution, they have collectively established wholesale and production societies.1
Hire-Purchase Sales
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as cars,
furniture, washing machines, refrigerators and cookers, has been greatly helped by
instalment purchasing. The Board of Trade has powers to regulate the terms of hire-
purchase and credit sales agreements. Controls imposed in 1955 were completely
revoked in October 1958, but in April i960 minimum deposits and maximum repay¬
ment periods for most categories of consumer goods were reintroduced. By the end of
June i960, the total hire-purchase debt had grown to £967 million.
Retailers finance most of their own hire-purchase business (covering furniture and
other domestic goods) and at the end of June i960 the hire-purchase debt owed directly
to them, including a small amount rediscounted by finance houses, was £337 million.
The balance of their business is directly financed by finance houses but these companies
are mainly concerned with the financing of hire-purchase business in motor vehicles
and industrial, farm, and commercial equipment. At the end of June i960, the hire-
purchase debt owed directly to them was ^630 million. There are a large number of
these companies but a high proportion of the business is done by a small number who
operate on a national scale.
Packaging
The British Productivity Council estimated in 1958 that British industry spent not
less than £400 million annually on packaging, an increase of one-third during the
previous decade. The expansion of self-service shops and the growth of sales in the
form of branded and standardised products have been major factors in the great
1 The two major wholesale societies are the Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited and the
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited.
446
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
changes which have taken place in packaging methods. These developments are
reflected in the marked increases in output of the industries concerned—plastics,
fibreboard, metal tubes, tin plate and glass containers. Fruit and vegetables, for example,
are increasingly sold in packs of transparent film. Aerosol dispensers, almost unknown
a few years ago, are being used at a rate of over 25 million a year. Laminated aluminium
foil is now employed extensively as a wrapping material in the food industry. A
Packaging Centre has been set up in London to provide information on packaging
methods.
Advertising
The expansion of productive capacity in industries manufacturing consumer goods
in Britain, and the ever-increasing choice of goods and services available to the con¬
sumer in recent years, have been accompanied by a steady upward trend in expenditure
on advertising. About £405 million is estimated1 to have been spent on all forms
of advertising in 1959. Almost £200 million was expended on press advertising, over
three-fifths of it in the national and provincial press and the rest in periodicals and
magazines and in the technical trade press; and about £60 million (about 18 per cent
more than in 1958) was spent on television advertising. The remainder was divided
between other media, such as posters, films, catalogues, window displays, exhibitions,
and free samples and gift schemes. Most of the advertising is carried out by adver¬
tising agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer research and
other services. The central organisation of the profession is the Institute of Incor¬
porated Practitioners in Advertising.
Consumer Protection
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the consumer
against specific abuses. Independent organisations have also sought to establish
voluntary minimum standards of quality. Weights and measures legislation, one
of the earliest forms of consumer protection, is strictly enforced by qualified inspectors.
The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, are designed to ensure that the marking of
goods is both accurate and honest. The British Standards Institution (see p. 265)
has established a number of standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial
Design (see p. 226) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
Advice to the public on the merits of consumer goods is provided through the British
Standards Institution’s Consumer Advisory Council, with a membership of 63,000
and the Consumers’ Association Ltd., a private body financed by the subscriptions
of members, who number 175,000. Assistance with certain aspects of consumer guidance
is also given by a number of other private bodies and by certain Government depart¬
ments, e.g., the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Special arrangements,
in the form of consumer councils and consumer committees, have been made for the
nationalised industries. Individual trades and industries have also taken measures to
raise standards of quality.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs
Acts, 1955, 1956, and 1958.
A committee was set up by the President of the Board of Trade, in the summer
of 1959, to consider and report whether changes in the law and other measures are
desirable for the further protection of the consumer. It published an interim report
in April i960 {Cmnd. ion), in which it recommended the enactment of legislation
1 This estimate was given by Mark Abrams in an article in the Financial Times of 20th April,i960.
TRADE
447
empowering ministers to make regulations prohibiting the sale of consumer goods not
conforming to specified safety standards in any case where such a prohibition becomes
necessary.
In March i960, the President of the Board of Trade set up a confidential fact-finding
inquiry into the extent and effects of individual resale price maintenance (see p. 268).
A prospective purchaser of a second-hand car can obtain, on application to a Citizens’
Advice Bureau (see p. 133), guidance as to whether the car he proposes to buy is the
subject of a hire-purchase agreement. Virtually every hire-purchase agreement on a
car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd., a non-profit-making company whose
members are car dealers or finance companies concerned with car sales, and this com¬
pany will answer inquiries made through its members, the police, solicitors, the
motoring associations, or the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux.
XIV. LABOUR
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at end-June i960 was about 24
million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included about 73 per cent
of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women, 15 years to 64
years for men). In fact, about 95 per cent of British men of working age are today
in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 5 per cent consist mainly of those con¬
tinuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some persons of private means.
The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful work is much lower,
about 50 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take employment outside the
home, or if they have, are prevented by household duties from doing so. Besides
those of normal working age, there are nearly 1J million older men and women still at
work. The great majority of the working population work for a wage or salary, but
between 1^ and if million are employers or self-employed.
The situation is markedly different in Northern Ireland, where the ratio of working
to total population is under 40 per cent, and farmers and smallholders working their
own holdings account for about an eighth of the working population. Northern Ireland,
however, has under 3 per cent of the United Kingdom population, so that the figures
for Great Britain are broadly representative of the position in the United Kingdom.
During the present century, decreases in both birth and death rates have had the
effect of increasing the proportion of persons over the age of 35 years in both the total
population and the working population. Changes in social habits have also had their
effect. The minimum working age has been raised to 15 years. The proportion of those
over the normal working age who are occupied has declined (though the great increase
in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are working
has increased). 'I he proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has remained
very high at all ages. Among women, on the other hand, there has been a steady
increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age groups 15 to 59,
but this has been offset by the raising of the minimum working age and by a decrease
in the proportion of women employed above the age of 59. There has been an increase
in the employment of married women, particularly in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work tends to decrease with age but is at every age
much higher for single than for married women. Almost all single women in their early
twenties are in, or seeking, employment, compared with rather more than half in their
late fifties; among married women, however, the proportion occupied, which is between
a third and two-fifths for women in their early twenties, declines for the age-groups
25 f° 34 but rises again for those aged between 35 and 54. Nearly 30 per cent of the
female labour force is under 25 years of age and about 6 per cent is over 60. An increas¬
ing number of women in the middle and upper age groups are taking up employment
(including part-time work) and the total number of married women occupied is now
as great as, if not greater than, the number of single women occupied.
4 he total working population (including men and women in the armed forces)
rose considerably during the second world war when housewives, including mothers
of young children, manned war factories at great personal inconvenience, while men
448
LABOUR
449
served in the armed forces. From the end of the war until mid-1947, the size of the
working population declined as women left industry and the growth of the population
of working age slowed down, largely because of the low birth rates of the 1930s.
However, after remaining fairly steady from mid-1948 to mid-1949, the total working
population rose slowly until the autumn of 1957, then fell slightly until March 1959,
but has since tended to rise. Owing to the high birth rate in the years 1944-49, a fairly
rapid increase in the population of working age, and therefore in the working population,
is expected in the next five years.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between mid-1948
and mid-1960 are shown in Table 39. Figures for mid-1960 are provisional.

(a) The total working population represents the estimated total number of persons
15 and over who work for pay or gain, or register themselves as available for such work. The
total comprises the armed forces, men and women on release leave not yet in employment, ah
persons—employers and workers on their own account as well as employees in civil employ¬
ment (including persons temporarily laid off but still on the employers pay-rolls) and wholly
unemployed persons registered for employment. Part-time workers are counted as lull units.
The number of persons on release leave is not showm separately as it has been small in recent years.

450
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Deployment of Labour
Some 41 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 4^ per cent in agriculture and fisheries,
even at the height of summer. Over half of those in manufacturing are in the metals,
engineering, vehicles and chemicals groups of industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups in
which women are chiefly employed are in the metal-using industries, in the manu¬
facture of textiles and clothing, in the food, drink and tobacco industries, and in the
distributive trades and professional and miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 40. Figures for mid-1960 are provisional.
The numbers given in Table 40, as working in an industry or service, include those
engaged on administrative and clerical work, so that the numbers engaged on productive
processes are smaller than those given for the industries as a whole. The 1951 Censuses

of Population showed that less than a third of men at work and less than a quarter of
women at work were employed in manual occupations in mining or manufacturing
industry. On the other hand, there were in Great Britain at the time of the 1951 Censuses
of Population over 1,400,000 women clerical workers (including typists), over 800,000
in retail trade, over one million women domestic workers or charwomen (including
those in hotels, institutions and offices), 500,000 women in various other forms of
personal service (including catering), nearly a quarter of a million nurses, and 220,000
women teachers.
The industrial and occupational distribution of the population has changed during
the twentieth century. Some short-term changes were brought about by the two
world wars and by the severe trade recession and unemployment of the inter-war
years, but the following appear to be the main long-term trends:
1. A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
2. A general increase in administrative and clerical employment, including
public administration, and a very large increase in the employment of women
in clerical work, including typing.
3. A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries, notably
coalmining and cotton textiles.
4. A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 and 1951 and has since
increased by a further 10 per cent. Expansion has been most marked in those
sections of the industries making relatively new types of products, e.g., cars,
aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus and plastics. The rate of increase
in certain branches of these industries was accelerated during both world wars.
5. A decline in indoor private domestic service, in which the number of women
employed fell by about a million between 1901 and 1951.
6. A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades. This
long-term trend was reversed only during the two world wars.
Unemployment and Labour Demand
Since the end of the second world war, unemployment in all parts of Great Britain
has been very much less than in the period between the two world wars, when the
general rate ranged between 9 and 22 per cent.
This decline in unemployment is due partly to specific measures taken by the Govern¬
ment (see pp. 255-7) but, in the main, to changes in the general economic situation.
The general demand for labour has been high, the number of vacancies on the registers
of employment exchanges usually exceeding the number of unemployed, while the
demand for certain types of skilled craftsmen and for qualified scientists, engineers and
technicians has far exceeded the supply.
From 1945 to 1957, the unemployment rate in Great Britain (the ratio of the number
of unemployed to the total number of employees) ranged between 1 and 2 per cent,
except for two brief periods (the coal shortage in the winter of i946—47 and the textile
slump of 1952). Towards the end of I957> there was, partly as a result of anti-inflationary
measures, a slackening in the general demand for labour, and an easing of the shortages
of skilled engineering workers. In 195^* unemployment rose, and the unemployment
rate reached a peak of 2-8 per cent in March I959- ^ince then, unemployment has
tended to fall as industry and commerce have responded to rising demand.
452
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The unemployment rate varies in different localities and, though high unemploy¬
ment has ceased generally to be a problem in any of the major industrial regions, there
is still relatively high unemployment in a number of districts in Scotland and Wales,
and in certain seaside resorts and isolated localities in England, including most
of Cornwall. Under the Local Employment Act, i960, the Government has powers
to alleviate unemployment in those districts known as development districts.
Northern Ireland
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed, but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 534,000 in June
I959 (S^S)000 males and 171,000 females). The largest industries are agriculture
and textiles. Most of the agricultural work in Northern Ireland is done by small
farmers and their families without hired help. The total manpower in agriculture,
forestry and fisheries was 79,000 in mid-1959, according to the official estimates of
the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance of the Northern Ireland Government,
and was considerably larger according to other estimates which include unpaid helpers,
but the number of insured employees in these industries was only about 18,000.
The textile industry, traditionally concerned with linen, employs about 63,000 people
and now makes extensive use of man-made fibres as well as natural fibres.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in England,
Wales or Scotland. In mid-July i960 it was about 6 per cent of the insured employees
and, since 1945, has rarely fallen below 6 per cent. The Ministry of Commerce of the
Northern Ireland Government has wide powers (similar to those of the Board of Trade
in development districts in Great Britain) to assist the development and diversification
of industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to improve the
situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services in Great Britain has been one of the principal
functions of the Ministry of Labour since its inception in 1916. Northern Ireland has
its own legislation in these matters which embodies the main principles of the corres¬
ponding legislation in Great Britain, but owing to the much smaller area of
administration and the less favourable employment situation, the facilities available
are not so comprehensive in their scope as is the case in Great Britain, and administrative
arrangements are in some respects on different lines. The responsible department is
the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance.
The following account, therefore, of services in Great Britain applies in general
to Northern Ireland except where otherwise stated. The scope of the services in
Great Britain has gradually been extended to include the provision of advice on
employment and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and
Training Act, 1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services.
The main services are provided through the country-wide network of some 900
local employment and branch employment offices, which act as employment exchanges.
Local employment committees, composed of representatives of employers, workers
and other local interests serving all areas, are attached to certain employment exchanges
as advisory bodies to secure for the department the full benefit of local knowledge and
the close co-operation of employers and workers. There are additional services intended
to meet the needs of men and women who are qualified, or who are likely to qualify,
for professional, administrative, managerial, senior executive and higher technical
LABOUR
453
and scientific posts at home and overseas. These are operated in Great Britain as follows:
1. The Technical and Scientific Register, kept centrally in London, which deals
with qualified scientists, engineers, architects and surveyors.
2. Regional Nursing Appointments Offices (to) and Nursing Appointments
Offices (164), which deal with recruitment for training and employment
in nursing, midwifery, radiography, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and
similar professions and medical laboratory technical work.
3. The Professional and Executive Register held at certain of the larger employ¬
ment exchanges, which provides a service for all other persons qualified for
professional and senior executive posts; ex-regular officers of the armed forces;
and young men and women suitable for training for management. Information
about this service can be obtained from any local office of the ministry.
General Services for Adults
All the offices referred to above accept on their registers both employed and
unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary function is to introduce
suitable persons seeking employment to employers requiring employees, thus providing
an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and meeting the needs of the
national economy.
The employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive Register
are also ready to give information about the professions and allied occupations to
young men and women aged 18 years and over who have not already established them¬
selves in a profession or in the business world, and to older people who wish to change
their careers.
The reduction in the armed forces as a result of plans announced in 1957 for the
reorganisation of defence (see p. no) made necessary a special service to help the
many regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life. A Regular Forces
Resettlement Service, assisted by an advisory board representative of employers and
trade unions, was started within the Ministry of Labour in 1957* Between July 195?
and the end of March i960 about 16,000 officers and 200,000 other ranks—about
two-thirds of those to be prematurely retired—left the armed forces and nearly all
found work. By the end of June i960 only 680 officers and 703 other ranks remained
unemployed. The advisory board, originally appointed for two years, has not been
reappointed. On the recommendation of the advisory board the Ministry of Labour
arranged with local education authorities in various parts of the country for the
provision at commercial colleges of short business training courses lasting six weeks
and designed to meet the needs of regulars who wish to take up a business career.
A four-week course in the skills of industrial supervision has recently been introduced
to help the resettlement in civil life of regular Warrant Officers and senior NCOs.
The courses are held at the ministry’s Staff Training College, Letchworth.
A special responsibility of the local employment offices is recruitment under the
vocational training scheme. In Britain, the main responsibility for vocational training
for employment below professional level rests on the industries and trades directly
concerned. The main purpose of the ministry’s scheme is to assist certain classes of
people in special need of help to fit themselves for suitable employment, but the
ministry is also concerned in helping to overcome shortages of labour in key industries
and for this purpose training is available more widely. 1 he majority of trainees under
the scheme are disabled persons but many are able-bodied men and women seeking
employment after voluntary service in the regular armed forces, or other unemployed
454
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
persons having special difficulty in resettlement (including skilled workers whose
prospects of employment in their existing trade are poor).
The training is normally provided at one of the 14 Government Training Centres
which are situated near the main industrial areas, but training under the scheme can
in some cases be arranged at technical and commercial colleges, private training schools
or employers’ establishments and, for the more severely disabled, at four Residential
Training Centres run by voluntary societies. A disabled person can be trained under
the scheme in any occupation which offers a reasonable prospect of resettlement.
Training in most trades is also open to those leaving the regular armed forces. Other
able-bodied men and women can be considered for training at Government Training
Centres, where a fairly wide range of trades is available.
Courses vary in length according to the trade; most last for six months. Schemes of
training for particular trades have been drawn up in consultation with representatives
of the employers and workers concerned, who in some cases also assist in the selection
of persons suitable for training. Allowances, at a higher rate than for unemployment
benefit, are paid to trainees during training to maintain them and their dependants.
Over 5,000 people were trained under the scheme in 1959, and about 95 per cent of
them were subsequently employed in the trade for which they had been trained.
In recent years, it has been the Government’s policy, in view of the increasing
numbers of older persons in the population, to promote the employment of older
men and women by persuading employers to change their approach to the problem.
In 1952, the Minister of Labour appointed the National Advisory Committee on the
Employment of Older Men and Women to advise and assist him in carrying out this
policy. The committee’s first report, published in October 1953, recommended that
the test for engagement should be capacity and not age and that all who can give
effective service should have the chance to continue in work if they so wish; and it
made suggestions for overcoming any difficulties that might prevent these principles
from being applied. These recommendations have been put into practice by the
Government and by many other leading employers, and have had a favourable influence
upon employers and upon public opinion in general. The committee issued its second
report in December 1955, in which it reviewed developments. In November 1958, it
was decided to disband the committee as further work in this field could best be
carried out through the ordinary machinery of the National Joint Advisory Council.
Training of Apprentices
The Government training scheme has until recently been confined to adults. In
view of the larger age-groups beginning to leave school, however, the Minister of
Labour announced in April i960, that he proposed to establish a certain number
of classes for first-year apprentices at Government Training Centres. The training
would be free and full time, and would include release for further education on one
day a week, but employers would have to undertake to maintain the apprentices
pay and to take them back to complete their training. The scheme would be on a
limited scale (300 places) and preference would be given to firms which found it
impracticable to undertake apprentice training or to increase their present number of
apprentices.
Special Training Services
The Ministry of Labour provides a service to industry through its scheme of draining
Within Industry for Supervisors. The four programmes of instruction which comprise
the TWI scheme are: job relations, the fostering of good working relationships; job

instruction, the technique of instructing or directing staff; job methods, the steps taken
in planning the best way of doing a job; and job safety, which seeks to arouse safety
consciousness and to train supervisors to detect dangers and deal with them.
The ministry employs a small staff of TWI officers, whose work is mainly directed
to the training of firms’ TWI instructors, who then train the supervisors in their own
organisations by the group discussion method. The ministry is prepared to extend a
measure of these services to overseas branches of British firms. It is prepared also to
train suitable persons to develop the scheme in their own territories. The arrangements
may be made by the Government of the country concerned or (where appropriate)
by the International Labour Organisation.
In addition, the ministry’s Technical Staff College at Letchworth, Hertfordshire,
provides two-week courses in teaching methods for instructors responsible for the
training of apprentices and other workers. These courses have been developed by the
ministry to meet its own requirements for the training of instructors engaged in training
adults in skilled occupations at Government Training Centres, and the syllabus
has been made available to employers in the United Kingdom and in overseas
countries.
Services for Foreigners
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to the prospective
employer by the Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is in Northern Ireland). About
40,000 such permits are issued each year. Of these, approximately one-half are for
domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other institutions and private households, and
one-eighth for student employees. Employment is limited to a maximum of one year
in the first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. In certain
circumstances, permission may be given by the Home Office for foreigners who landed
as visitors or students to take employment approved by the ministry. Approval is
subject to the same conditions and requirements as are applied to the issue of permits
to foreigners while still abroad
Before a permit is issued, the ministry must be satisfied that there is a bona fide
job, that no suitable British or foreign wrorker already resident in Britain for a long
period is available, and that the wages and conditions of employment are not less
favourable than those enjoyed by British workers. These conditions are waived for
student employees who are admitted for limited periods in order to impro\e their
English and to gain a wider knowledge of their occupations. A foreigner permitted to
take employment in the United Kingdom may not change his employment, unless his
prospective employer has obtained prior approval from the ministry to employ the
foreigner.
The permit system applies to individual foreigners. In addition, after the second
world war far greater numbers were admitted under various schemes organised by
the Ministry of Labour, notably the resettlement of members of the Polish Forces
who felt themselves unable to return to post-war Poland, and the recruitment of
European volunteer workers from the displaced persons’ camps in Germany, Austria
and Denmark. More recently, the United Kingdom Government has admitted many
Hungarian refugees who fled from their country following the uprising m October
ioe6 (see p. it), and there is a current scheme whereby the ministry assists in the bulk
recruitment of Italian workers. Special arrangements are made to dispense with the
need for individual permits in these cases.

The United Kingdom, as a member of the Western European Union, participates
in the arrangements for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain
employment in other member countries.
It must be stressed that these controls over entry and employment apply only to
citizens of foreign countries. Except as regards employment in Northern Ireland,
there are no such controls over persons from Commonwealth countries and territories
overseas and citizens of the Irish Republic. There are no current records of the
numbers now resident or in employment, but information about the numbers of such
persons resident in 1951 is available from the population censuses.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour is also responsible in Great Britain for two
specialised employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the Disablement
Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 years of age at the start of their working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Education
and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive is appointed by the
Minister of Labour, who is responsible to Parliament for the Youth Employment
Service as a whole. The minister has appointed a National Youth Employment Council
and separate advisory committees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him.
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities) in
accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not in operation, the
service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information on
careers, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, find suitable employment
and keep contact with young workers to help them to settle down. A further function
is to help employers to fill vacancies for young people. Recently the service has launched
a scheme for providing first-year apprenticeship training in Government Training
Centres. Local youth employment committees, made up of teachers, employers,
workers and other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland, a Youth Employment Service of more limited scope is operated
by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, and in co-operation with this
service, one local education authority provides a Vocational Guidance Service. A com¬
prehensive Youth Employment Service similar in scope to that operating in Great
Britain is now being set up.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The purpose of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Acts, 1944 and 1958, on which
all the ministry’s work for disabled persons is based, is ‘to make further and better
provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment
or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service is designed
to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is available to all
persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped as a result of
injury, disease or congenital deformity in obtaining or keeping employment.
The Ministry of Labour is responsible for the administration of the service. At each
of its local offices there is a disablement resettlement officer, working under the
LABOUR
457
direction of the manager and in co-operation with other officers. Besides his
contacts with employers this officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area
and visits any patient who wishes to discuss the question of future employment. His
work involves close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary welfare
agencies.
The help given by the service falls under four main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by disablement resettlement
officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local disablement advisory committees,
hospital resettlement clinics and medical interviewing committees, and also by
vocational psychologists in the industrial rehabilitation units (see paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Employment. Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifica¬
tions and aptitude and to medical guidance, and concentrating on what the person
can do rather than on what he cannot do, the disablement resettlement officer endeavours
to find the work most suited to each person, either immediately, or in appropriate
cases after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To some extent
this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons Employment Act,
1944, namely, that all employers of 20 or more persons are required to employ a
quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except shipping, in respect of the manning
of ships) of registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of
disabled persons registered in April i960 was 692,000. At the same date 54,000 registered
disabled were unemployed, 50,000 being considered capable of ordinary employment.
The remaining 4,000 were so severely disabled as to be classed as unlikely to obtain
ordinary employment, though in fact many so classed are found work in unsubsidised
competitive undertakings by careful selective placement.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation and Vocatiotial Training. Industrial rehabilitation is
provided at residential and non-residential units run by the Ministry of Labour
where physical and mental toning-up is given and, for those who need it, vocational
guidance as to the best kind of employment to take up.1 For the blind, similar industrial
rehabilitation facilities, to the cost of which the ministry contributes, are available
at two centres conducted by voluntary organisations.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments (see p. 454)* For the
more seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary
organisations with the financial assistance and technical help of the Ministry of Labour.
There are also arrangements for the training of special categories of disabled persons
such as the blind, and for providing disabled persons (including the blind), who are
of the appropriate educational standard, with grants to undertake study and training
for the purpose of acquiring professional qualifications.
4. Sheltered Employment. Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company,
with no share capital, was set up in accordance with the provisions of the Disabled
Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide training and employment
facilities for registered disabled persons unlikely to obtain work except under special
conditions. Its powers include the provision of special factories and workshops, hostel
accommodation and facilities for homeworkers. 4 he directors are appointed by the
Minister of Labour; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour \ ote. At the end of i959»
1 For an account of medical rehabilitation of the disabled, see p. 149-
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
458
Remploy Ltd. operated 90 factories and employed 6,275 severely disabled men and
women, including some 130 homeworkers.
Facilities for the employment of blind persons are provided by local authorities
directly or through voluntary bodies, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour. At end-December 1959, there were 67 workshops for the blind in which
there were 264 blind persons in training and 3,753 in employment. The ministry
also helped to finance the training or employment of 1,064 severely disabled sighted
persons in 39 workshops run by 32 voluntary undertakings or local authorities. Some
1,200 blind persons were working at home under homeworkers’ schemes.
CONDITIONS OF WORK AND TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, industrial workers lacked legitimate
means of defending their standards of living or of ameliorating their working conditions.
The traditional methods of fixing wages had become obsolete, trade unions were
regarded as criminal conspiracies, and there was no protective legislation setting
minimum standards of safety, health and welfare in places of work.
The first attempt at protective legislation was the Health and Morals of Apprentices
Act, 1802, but the first effective Factory Act was that of 1833 which created an inspec¬
torate employed and paid by the central Government to enforce its provisions. Since
that date, legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the statutory
protection for employees has been passed at an accelerating rate. The progress in
standards has owed much to the recommendations of strengthened inspectorates,
much to the example of progressive employers and much to the persistent pressure of
trade unions and disinterested reformers.
Trade unions ceased to be actionable conspiracies in 1824 but their status as legal
entities was not properly established until 1871. This latter step had been made
acceptable to public opinion by the leaders of certain craft unions, who had abandoned
the revolutionary and financially unsound policies of earlier trade unions to pursue a
limited practical objective, i.e. the improvement of their members’ wages and con¬
ditions through skilful and honest negotiation from positions of financial strength.
After 1880, the organisation of unskilled workers became more extensive and effective
and the whole tone of trade unionism became more militant and political. At the same
time, many employers were still hostile to trade unionism and were unwilling to
negotiate with trade unions or to recognise agreements made on an industry-wide
basis. Partly as a result of continuing antagonisms and of the changing and difficult
economic situation, much of the first thirty years of the twentieth century was marked
by widespread and prolonged strikes. Since 1932, however, the strike rate (in terms of
man-days lost) has, in most years, been very much lower, and arrangements for the
negotiation of terms of service and the peaceful settlement of disputes have become
general and are on the whole satisfactory.
This improvement in industrial relations has been achieved mainly by voluntary
action. There is, in general, no legal obligation on an employer to recognise a trade
union, or not to refuse to employ trade unionists; nor is a collective agreement with a
trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of employment.
In practice, however, minimum standards exist and are enforced for both the con¬
ditions of work and the wages and other terms of employment of a substantial majority
of British workers. Settlement of terms of employment, however, involves principles,
methods and machinery quite different from the determination of conditions of work.
Minimum standards for conditions of work are laid down mainly by statute. Acts
LABOUR
459
of Parliament and statutory instruments prescribe minimum standards of safety,
health and welfare, regulate hours of work for women and young persons, and provide
for the appointment of Government Inspectors to enforce the law. In some cases,
additional health, safety or welfare requirements are the subject of collective
agreements, while many employers provide higher standards on their own
initiative with help and advice from Government departments and various voluntary
bodies.
Wages and other terms of employment of the majority of workers, on the other hand,
are usually settled by collective agreements and the determination by statute of mini¬
mum wages, holidays and holiday pay is in principle confined to those trades or indus¬
tries where the organisation of employers or workers or both is inadequate to negotiate
collective agreements and to ensure their observance.
Management-employee relations depend not only on terms and conditions of
employment, but on human relationships at the place of work; managements have in
recent years become increasingly concerned with improving such relationships.
CONDITIONS OF WORK: THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their employees
and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of care towards
each other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety, health and welfare
are laid down in a number of statutes.
The principal Acts involving enforcement of standards of safety, health or welfare
are: the Public Health Acts; the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children
Act, 1920; the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933; the Employment of Women
and Young Persons Act, 1936; the Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938; the
Factories Acts, 1937, 1948, and 1959; the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954; the Shops
Act, 1950; the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956; and the
Offices Act, i960. There are a number of other Acts dealing with particular requirements
or particular occupations.
Powers of Local Authorities
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the provision
of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work and to treat work¬
places which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances whose abatement
can be enforced. They have also wide powers under the Children and Young Persons
Act, 1933, as modified by the Education Acts, 1944 to 1948, to regulate hours and
conditions of employment of children in their areas within the limits laid down by
national legislation. Apart from this, national legislation forbids the employment of
children under 13 years of age, and forbids the employment of children between the
ages of 13 and 15 during school hours, or before 6 a.m. or after 8 p.m. on any day, or
for more than two hours on schooldays or on Sundays. The employment of children
in any industrial undertaking before they reach the age of 15 is prohibited.
Shops
The Shops Act, 1950, makes local authorities responsible for ensuring that shops in
their area observe its requirements. With certain exceptions, shops must be closed
on weekdays by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. on one late day) except on the early closing day when
they must be closed by 1 p.m., and all day on Sundays', but local authorities may make
orders modifying these and other provisions of the Act within their own areas. The
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
460
hours of work of employees under 16 years of age are normally restricted to 44 a week,
and those of employees between 16 and 18 years of age to 48 a week with limited
provision for overtime. All shop assistants must be given a half-holiday (half a day)
every week and, in addition, every Sunday off or another day off instead. Local
authorities also have powers to ensure reasonable minimum standards of ventilation,
temperature, lighting, sanitary accommodation and washing facilities in shops.
Offices
Under the Offices Act, i960, which will come into force on 1st January, 1962, the
Secretary of State for the Home Department may make regulations specifying standards
to be applied in offices to protect the health, safety and welfare of employees. These
regulations may deal with structure, arrangement and operation and in particular with
sanitary conveniences, working facilities, the prevention of overcrowding, lighting,
temperature, ventilation, accommodation for clothing, cleaning of offices, drinking
water, means of escape in case of fire, first-aid equipment, maintenance and inspection
of electrical equipment, the fencing of any dangerous machinery or equipment, and
the restriction of the employment of women after childbirth. The enforcement of the
provisions of the Act and of regulations made under it are, in general, the responsibility
of the local authority in each area, but in offices forming part of a factory or of a mine
or quarry the responsibility lies with the Factory Inspectorate or the Mines and
Quarries Inspectorate.
Factories and Industrial Premises
Nearly a quarter of a million industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughter¬
houses, shipyards, docks and warehouses) and about 25,000 building and civil engineer¬
ing sites come under the Factories Acts, which are administered by the Ministry of
Labour and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate of Factories, which forms part of the
ministry. Any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify the Inspector
of Factories of his intention not less than one month before he begins to occupy them.
Under the Acts, every fatal accident and every accident causing more than three
days’ incapacity must be reported to the factory inspectors; provision is also made for
compulsory notification and investigation of certain dangerous occurrences, industrial
poisonings and diseases, and, in addition, a number of general and specific requirements
for safety, health and welfare are laid down.
Safety requirements include provisions concerning the fencing of prime movers,
transmission machinery and dangerous parts of other machinery; the sale, hire or use
of power-driven machinery without effective guards of certain parts; the cleaning of
machinery in motion; the training and supervision of young persons employed at
certain machines; the examination of hoists and lifting equipment, steam boilers and
steam and air receivers; the construction of floors; precautions against falls, against
gassing, and against explosions of inflammable dust or gas; fire prevention, fire¬
fighting, fire alarms and means of escape in case of fire; the protection of the eyes;
the handling of dangerous substances; and the lifting of heavy weights.
There are also general requirements with regard to health, including cleanliness
of workrooms, the observance of proper standards of accommodation and ventilation
and of suitable temperatures and lighting, the avoidance of overcrowding and the
provision of sanitary accommodation; the protection of workers against inhaling harm¬
ful dust or fumes; and with regard to welfare, including the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking water, first
aid and adequate seating arrangements.
LABOUR
461
All young persons under 18 years of age must, on entry to employment in factories,
at docks, or on building operations, be medically examined by doctors appointed by
the Chief Inspector of Factories and known as Appointed Factory Doctors (see p. 467),
and they must be re-examined annually until they reach the age of 18. Women and
young persons are also prohibited from working in certain specified processes involving
lead compounds. The working hours of women and young persons between the ages
of 16 and 18 are generally limited to 48 in a week and 9 in a day, although some over¬
time is allowed (up to six hours a week but not more than 100 hours a year nor in
more than 25 weeks in a year). Young persons under 16 years of age are limited to
44 hours a week. Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and young
persons and the employment of women and girls at night is, in general, prohibited.
The Minister of Labour, however, has discretion to grant applications for relaxations
of the rules on working hours if, after consulting the appropriate organisations and
employers and workers, he decides that they are clearly in the public interest.
Moreover, such relaxations must be published.
The general requirements for safety, health and welfare are supplemented or
modified by regulations providing for safeguards against special risks to health or
safety. The regulations cover particular industries, processes, and types of machinery,
and they include provision for the compulsory periodic medical examination of workers
in certain specified industrial processes.
In addition to regulatory functions, the Minister of Labour has been given the duty,
under the Factories Act, 1959, to promote safety, health and welfare by the collection
and dissemination of information and by investigating safety, health and welfare
problems. The Act thus provides a specific statutory basis for activities which have
long been an important part of the ministry’s work.
Mines and Quarries
The safety, health and welfare of workers in mines and quarries are the subject
of comprehensive legislation. Protective legislation in mines began with an Act of 1842,
which forbade the employment of women underground; successive measures laid
down detailed requirements for the safe conduct of operations and dealt with such
matters as ventilation, dust suppression, support of workings, the safe use of electricity,
rescue and first aid. The latest stage was reached when the Mines and Quarries Act
was passed in 1954. This Act established the basic modern principles of safety,,
and welfare, leaving the details to be dealt with in statutory regulations; it both
consolidates the previous law and brings it up to date. Apart from technical matters,
it also covers such subjects as the general responsibilities of owners and managements,
the appointment and duties of officials, training, welfare, the powers of official inspectors
statutory qualifications of managers and under-managers, employment o women an
young persons, and inspections on behalf of workmen. ... . r ,
The Ministry of Power is generally responsible for the administration of these
enactments, while the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, which is part o t e inistr)
of Power, is directly responsible for their enforcement.
Agriculture
Two Acts provide for the protection of agricultural workers by means of regulations
made by the ministers concerned with agriculture in Great titam. e rls ®
involved in the use of chemicals are dealt with in the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances)
Act, 1952; general safety is covered by the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfa
Provisions) Act, 1956.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
462
Transport
The general safety legislation covering the main forms of transport protects transport
workers as well as members of the public against accidents involving moving vehicles.
The Minister of Transport is responsible for the administration of the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which cover in great detail the question of marine safety, including
navigational procedures, the strength and design of hulls, the safety of machinery, the
safety and design of living quarters, life-saving appliances, measures for protection
against fire, and the carriage of special cargoes and dangerous goods.
The Air Navigation Order and Regulations provide for the registration of aircraft
and for the issue of certificates of airworthiness and of competency certificates and
licences for aircrew, lay down requirements for safety equipment and for safety
procedures during take-off, flight and landing, and prescribe maintenance schedules
for public transport aircraft. The Minister of Aviation delegates most of his powers in
respect of airworthiness to the Air Registration Board (see p. 382).
The Minister of Transport exercises technical supervision of the safety aspects of
railway construction and operation through an inspectorate, whose main functions are
statutory approval of new works on railways carrying passenger traffic; accident investi¬
gation, including the holding of formal inquiries; and technical advice to the minister.
In the interests of road safety, the hours of driving and the rest periods of drivers
of buses and goods vehicles are regulated by the Road Traffic Acts. In certain cases,
the driver must be accompanied by a second person.
In addition to general safety legislation, there are certain statutory provisions
concerned entirely, or mainly, with the safety, health and welfare of employees; for
example, railway employees are protected by the Railway Employment (Prevention
of Accidents) Act, 1900, and the statutory rules and orders made under it, which
sanction the appointment of railway employment inspectors to inquire into the
more serious accidents to railway employees and enable the Ministry of Transport
to require the use of safe plant and appliances, to forbid what is unsafe, and to make
rules for safe railway operation. Similarly, the far-reaching and detailed requirements
of the Merchant Shipping Acts and the regulations made thereunder include specific
provisions for the protection of merchant seamen covering such matters as the engage¬
ment and discharge of seamen, limitations on the employment of young persons at
sea, standards of crew accommodation, scales of provisions, medicines and medical
stores, and the care and repatriation of seamen left behind at ports abroad.
Employment of Young Persons
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, imposes restrictions on the hours
of work of young persons (48 a week under 18 years and 44 a week under 16 years)
in certain occupations not covered by the Factories Acts, the Mines and Quarries
Act, 1954, or the Shops Act, 1950.
Northern Ireland
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in Great Britain
and is embodied in separate statutes to meet the special requirements of Northern
Ireland. Provision for the safety, health and welfare of workers in factories, workshops,
ship and building yards and certain other working premises is embodied in the Northern
Ireland Factories Acts. The Minister of Labour and National Insurance is responsible
for the administration of these Acts and for their enforcement by a factory inspectorate,
which forms part of his department.

CONDITIONS OF WORK IN PRACTICE
Earnings
Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as determined
by agreements or wages orders, vary between 3s. 3d. and 4s. 4d. an hour for men
and between 2s. 2d. and 3s. 2d. for women. Actual earnings are usually higher. Higher
rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates raise the level
of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings
and hours of work of manual workers in manufacturing industries and in some of the
principal non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain. The survey made in April
i960 covered about 7 million workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all
the industries covered to be as follows:
Men 21 years and over ..
Youths and boys under 21 years
Women 18 years and over: full-time
part-time
Girls under 18 years
Average weekly earnings were:

Women: full-time

The survey does not cover agriculture, coalmining, railways, dockwork, shipping,
distribution, catering or other services. In agriculture the average weekly earnings
for regular adult male workers were 199s. yd. in the year April 1959 to March i960,
in coalmining, the average weekly cash earnings for men were 319s. 3d. plus 19s. 2d.
in kind in April i960; in the railway services average weekly earnings in March 1959
were 242s. for men in the wage-earning grades, including the workshop fu’
and 134s. for women; average weekly earnings of dock workers employed by the
National Dock Labour Board from January to March i960 were 315s. 5d.
Since 1947, average weekly wage rates have increased by about 86 per cent and
average weekly earnings by about 121 per cent. Most of the increase in wage rates
has been offset by a rise in the cost of living. The trends of manual workers earnings,
and of wage rates and retail prices from 1948 to 1959, compared with 1947, are s own
in the diagram on p. 464. r
Women in industry are for the most part engaged on d.iferent tasks from men
and are paid less than men on the grounds that these tasks are unskilled or semi¬
skilled. In the relatively few instanees in the field of manual employment where men
and women are employed on precisely the same work and under identical conditions,
collective agreements frequently provide for equal remuneration. f
There are no similarly detailed and comprehensive figures for the rates of pay
and earnings of non-manual workers, as these are often based on individual contracts
except in the public service, teaching and retail distribution The rather limited evidence
suggests that the majority of male non-manual workers-the clerks and shop assistants
-have average earnings little different in range from those of manual workers bu
the earnings of women in these occupations are somewhat higher than in ma
464
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
occupations. The pay of shop assistants is on scales prescribing weekly minima from
about £6 19s. 6d. to £9 9s. for men and £4 19s. 6d. to £6 16s. 6d. for women. The
Office Management Association makes periodic surveys of clerical salaries. The latest
survey, of March i960, which covers 1,112 establishments, employing 87,011 clerks,
shows that the average weekly salaries for young inexperienced clerks ranged mainly
from 76s. od. to 120s. od. for youths and from 66s. od. to 101s. od. for girls, while
average salaries for adult male clerks ranged from £12 6s. od. for the lowest grade
of skill and responsibility to £16 19s. od. for the highest. Corresponding women’s
salaries were 25 to 30 per cent less.
The starting salaries in many professional and technical careers are often in the
range of £500 to £700 a year, though they may be lower for trainees starting work in
their teens, and higher for some graduates entering industry and the Civil Service.
Such posts offer incremental progression to higher salaries and opportunities for
promotion. According to an investigation carried out by the Central Office of Informa¬
tion Social Survey in 1955-56 and published in the report of the Royal Commission
on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration, the average (median) annual remuneration
of qualified people ranged from £1,600 to £2,000 in the leading professions. It is
probably now from 14 to 20 per cent more.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service are in
the range of £1,500 to £5,000 a year. The posts with salaries of £5,000 to £12,000
a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, chairmen and some other members of
LABOUR
465
the boards of nationalised industries, judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal,
and Lords of Appeal, the Permanent Secretaries of Government departments, the
clerks of the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers, some persons
outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial posts in industry,
commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw still higher salaries, while the
earnings of star entertainers and certain other very successful people exceed £25,000
a year.
Regarding the incidence of such salaries, it may be noted that in 1957-58 only 2
per cent of all male employees and 0-2 per cent of female employees earned £1,500
or more a year. Only about o-8 per cent of all employees were earning over £2,000
a year, while only about 0-3 per cent earned over £3,000 and less than o-i per cent
over £5,000. ...
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices, administrative
posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for doing the same work in
medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, radiography, university teaching, journalism,
broadcasting and architecture, and as Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament,
salaried magistrates and solicitors, pharmacists working in hospitals, and administrative,
professional and technical workers in local government. Women in independent profes¬
sions are not expected to charge lower fees than men. In many other occupations,
however, a woman in Britain doing the same job as a man is still paid less for doing it,
although the position is changing. ,
The principle of equal pay for male and female salaried staff began to be implemented
in 1955 in the public service, including national and local government service, the
national health service, the nationalised industries, and teachers in maintained and
assisted schools. Progressive increases in women’s salaries will in most cases result
in men’s and women’s salary scales being assimilated by 1961. Women s salaries outside
the public service are being similarly adjusted in some cases.
Hours of Work
While the hours of work of adult men are not, in general, restricted by statute,
normal hours of work for both sexes and those of all ages are usually well within the
legal limits on the hours of women and young persons (see p. 459). Agreed weekly
hours are mainly from 42 to 46, including in many cases reductions of up to 2 hours
which have been agreed in recent months and may be worked as either a five- ay or
a five and a half-day week according to the industry and the rule of the particular
establishment. Hours actually worked by men are somewhat longer owing to overtime
working. The survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour in October 1959 m o
earnings and hours of manual workers showed that average weekly hours actually
worked were as follows:
Men
Youths and boys ..
Women: full-time
part-time
Girls
48-0 hours
44-2 hours
40- 8 hours
21-6 hours
41- 9 hours
Holidays with Pay .
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in in ^
covered by agreements or statutory orders are ent.tled to patd hohdays of twelve
days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or statutory pubhc hohdays,
466
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day, there are Bank
Holidays in England, Wales, and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, Whit-
Monday, the first Monday in August and the first weekday after Christmas (Boxing
Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the first Monday in May, and the first
Monday in August. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and, in addition,
has a Bank Holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and a statutory public holiday
on 12th July (commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); Easter Tuesday is also
a customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide that payments
should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
Safety
Safety depends in practice at least as much on the education and voluntary efforts
of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. There are nearly a
quarter of a million workplaces in Great Britain subject to the Factories Acts. The
total strength of the Factory Inspectorate including medical and other specialists
was 412 in June i960 and its authorised strength is 450. In June i960 there were
1,470 mines (including 730 main coal mines) and 4,594 quarries, including 241 open¬
cast coal sites; the total strength of the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate was 161.
Except in coal mines, prevention of accidents by frequent inspection is impracticable.
The concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with safety helps
to maintain safety standards, and the requirements about accident notification (see
p. 460) help inspectors to examine the means of prevention with employers, machinery
manufacturers and interested organisations. But the voluntary co-operation of manage¬
ments and employees in individual workplaces is essential to the safety drive. The
Accident Prevention Movement, a voluntary educational campaign, is strongly
supported by the Factory and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorates. Inspectors
inquire into safety aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert advice
by personal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment of
safety officers and the formation of works safety committees.
Most large and many small firms have such committees and, in many areas, safety
groups have been organised, whose members meet monthly for the exchange of
information, discussion, lectures and films on safety measures.
Training for safety is an important facet of the safety drive and, to help in this
work, the Ministry of Labour has recently incorporated a safety course in the Training
Within Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme (see p. 454). An industrial health and
safety centre in London is also maintained by the Ministry of Labour. An industrial
safety training centre in Birmingham is run by the Birmingham and District Industrial
Safety Group, and training centres for building and civil engineering foremen have
recently been set up, with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour, by the London
Building and Engineering Contractors’ Accident Prevention Group and by the
Merseyside Area Industrial Accident Prevention Group. The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents helps the Accident Prevention Movement by providing
publicity and by organising conferences and courses for safety officers.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing extent
with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information and advisory
services to their members. They participate also in joint standing and advisory com¬
mittees established by the Chief Inspector of Factories. Representatives of the Trades
Union Congress, the British Employers’ Confederation, the nationalised industries
and the Ministry of Labour meet on the Industrial Safety Sub-Committee of the
National Joint Advisory Council. The Minister of Labour has established a joint
LABOUR
467
advisory committee, representative of employers and workers in the building and civil
engineering industries, to examine safety and health problems in these industries.
Both transport operators and the Ministries of Transport and of Aviation give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every endeavour is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities, by improving
the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment, by traffic regulation and control
of standards of maintenance and by training crews in competency and safety awareness.
The detailed regulations and instructions issued by the ministries and their agents
form the basis of elaborate safety procedures laid down by the operators themselves
and by the makers of vehicles and aircraft, equipment and works. The radio industry
and the transport services co-operate in the development and application of radar
systems and other safety devices (see pp. 388-390).
Fatal and serious industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the twentieth
century. They rose somewhat in factories during die early years of the second world
war. Since then, however, there has been a further decline, and Britain’s fatal industrial
accident rate (per thousand man-years) is among the lowest in the world. Accidents
sufficiently serious to cause more than three days’ absence still happen, however, to
2-3 per cent of male factory employees every year and about 1 per cent of female factory
employees. Most of these accidents are due to quite ordinary causes—the handling of
goods, the use of hand-tools, or falls—and only a sixth are caused by power-driven
machinery. Fatal accidents occurring in 1959 in factories and other places of employ¬
ment subject to the Factories Acts numbered 598. Fatal accidents in mines and
quarries numbered 385* The total of fatal industrial accidents in factories, mines and
quarries, railways, civil aviation and trading and fishing vessels numbered 1,298-
Health and Welfare
Employers frequently achieve health and welfare standards considerably higher
than those prescribed by law. They are helped to do this by the inspectorates, by
Government departments and agencies, by employers associations and trade unions
and by expert voluntary bodies.
An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a whole-time or part-time doctor,
an industrial nurse, and a canteen with hot meals, pay part or all of the cost of clubs
and sports grounds, operate retirement and sickness insurance schemes supplementing
the State insurance schemes, and afford training and educational facilities. Some
have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
Periodic medical examinations are compulsory in factories for all young workers
under 18 years of age and for adults in certain dangerous occupations where such
examinations are of preventive value. These are carried out by some 2,200 Appointed
Factory Doctors, most of whom are engaged on a part-time basis. In addition, a
number of employers maintain medical services for their employees, and it is estimated
that there are altogether about 1,500 doctors, including about 400 ^ll-time doctors
and several thousand nurses and assistant nurses, in the industrial health services.
Increasing numbers of doctors and nurses are taking up this wor , w ic aims to
provide occupational health facilities of a specialised preventive c aracter.
The big employers, including the State and the boards of nationalised industries,
have naturally taken the lead in this expansion, and a number of smaller factories
are also covered, either because of special risks or because of their progressive out¬
look. There are, however, difficult problems to be solved in connection with the further
development of industrial health services, and in i955 the Minister of Labour appointed
a Standing Industrial Health Advisory Committee, of which he is the chairman, to
468
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
advise him on this subject. The membership of this committee includes persons
nominated by the British Employers’ Confederation, the Trades Union Congress, the
nationalised industries, the Medical Research Council, the British Medical Association,
the Royal College of Nursing and other organisations and bodies closely concerned
with the promotion of industrial health. This committee has been concerned with
getting more precise information about the industrial health services. With its advice
two pilot surveys have been undertaken for this purpose, one of a particular locality
and one of a particular industry. In the light of these and other investigations the
committee is examining the best ways of developing industrial health services.
Prompt and effective action in the field of industrial health depends, among other
things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation and
research. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate, which
has specialised medical and technical branches. Research facilities are provided by
Government agencies such as the Medical Research Council and the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research; by the faculties of industrial health and social
medicine of the universities; and by the research departments of various industries
and large industrial concerns. Co-ordination is provided by a number of general and
special committees.
Welfare standards vary considerably from one factory to another. The amenities
provided by large factories depend partly on the employees’ needs and desires.
The requirements of a factory where the work is light, and many employees are
women or young persons, are different from those of an iron foundry or steelworks,
where much of the work is arduous, and is undertaken by men. Progressive firms are
careful to find out what their employees want, and welfare policy is often decided in
consultation with the workers, through regular consultative machinery or by other means.
During and since the second world war, the provision of meals for workers at their
place of work has become usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller
ones. It is estimated that over 19,000 industrial premises have canteen facilities for their
workers. There are also colliery canteens providing meals for about 98 per cent of
coalminers. Any surplus earned by canteens is used to improve the canteen or to
finance some other welfare services, while any losses are borne by the firms.
LABOUR RELATIONS
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’ asso¬
ciations and trade unions. These organisations1 discuss and negotiate terms and con¬
ditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
In some industries these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings,
which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary joint machinery has been
established on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining
suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is often made for matters
not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain
trades where wages cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary agreement owing to
the inadequate organisation of employers or workers, provision has also been made by
the State for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Acts, 1945 to 1959, the
Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act, 1949.
1 Some employers, including the central Government and the public corporations operating
the nationalised industries, negotiate directly with the trade unions representing their different
types of employees.
LABOUR
469
Employers’ Associations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, which are
wholly or partly concerned with labour questions.
The primary aims of such employers’ associations are to help to establish suitable
terms and conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees
and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which
may arise. Different associations vary in the emphasis which they put upon these
different aims and in the means by which they try to achieve them. Some concentrate
on defensive action, trying by negotiation and representations to modify proposals of
trade unions and Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to give their
members practical help and advice in developing positive employment policies. They
may provide special services such as general or specialised training courses, or arrange
for the provision of such services by some specialist agency.
There is diversity in regard to structure as well as function. Generally, however,
employers’ associations are organised on an industry basis rather than a product basis.
Some associations are purely local in character and deal with a section of an industry;
others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of a particular industry.
In some of the chief industries there are local or regional organisations combined into
national federations, while in others within which different firms are engaged on
making different principal products, there is a very complex structure with national
and regional federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for the
industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 1,800 employers’ associations dealing
with labour matters and about 270 of them are national federations. These numbers
have not varied greatly in the last 25 years.
The final authority of a local or small national association may be a meeting, where
all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations some form of
indirect representation is necessary, either through local associations or through the
regions or sections into which these associations are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders, form a
general council, central committee or general committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter mainly to take major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify their
work. The committees usually include a general purposes committee and a negotiating
committee. A small paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting of senior
officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and
co-ordinate the work of the committees.
The British Employers' Confederation
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers Confederation,
which was set up in 1919 and was at first called the National Confederation of
Employers’ Organisations. Its membership now comprises some 60 separate auto¬
nomous organisations in industries employing about 70 per cent of the persons engaged
in private enterprise industries and services in the country. The boards of nationalised
industries are not in membership. The Confederation’s business is managed by a
council which meets under the chairmanship of the President and on which every
member organisation is represented.
The confederation deals with matters affecting the interests of organised employers
and their relations with their employees and is recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between Government departments and representatives of
470
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
private employers as a whole on such matters. It acts as an advisory and consultative
body for its member organisations, providing them with information and statistics,
ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, e.g., on the International Labour Organisation.
Its representatives sit on various councils and committees advisory to the Government,
on other statutory bodies, and on a number of voluntary bodies.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—-and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and organi¬
sation vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years ago
among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled
classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory,
technical and administrative workers. A number of associations of professional workers,
formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of professional standards,
have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade unions, including negotiations
on salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is industrial,
i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their occupation. In a
number of unions, recruitment is based on a combination of these principles. A few
large unions recruit members in a number of different occupations and industries.
At the end of 1958, the total membership of British trade unions was about 9,500,000.
There were 657 trade unions, but about two-thirds of all trade unionists were in the
17 largest unions.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local branch or
lodge. Every member of the union belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its
meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and conditions of employment, discuss
the work and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch officers. The
branch takes action on certain matters considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local
interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of work
to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed or customary
conditions of work, and, in some cases, to act as representatives of members at their
place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines: elected
officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist staff, are in
charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a national executive council
or committee which may be part time or full time, and which is usually elected by,
and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates from the branches.
Executive committees or councils play an important part in the government of the
unions; between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out policy
decisions made by delegates.
Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation, while in large
unions there are usually regional, district or area committees or councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an industry
in negotiation with employers. The scope and authority of these federations and
confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
LABOUR
471
Nearly all trade unions of any size and importance are affiliated to the Trades
Union Congress (TUC), the national centre of the British trade union movement.
The main exceptions are the National and Local Government Officers Association
(NALGO), the National Union of Teachers (NUT), and certain Civil Service staff
associations, all of them professional or quasi-professional bodies. The objects of
the TUC are to promote the interests of all its affiliated organisations and generally
to improve the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership com¬
prises 186 organisations, of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate
unions; approximately 350 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly. These
represent over 8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on questions
relating to particular trades or industries at the request of the trade union concerned.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a week
every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and to employees
generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents it during the remain¬
ing 51 weeks of the year. The General Council is responsible for carrying out congress
decisions, for watching economic and social developments, and for providing educa¬
tional and advisory services. It is also empowered in certain circumstances to mediate
in inter-union disputes.
The TUC and a number of affiliated unions have in recent years substantially
developed their educational services to members. At the training college in TUC
headquarters, Congress House, London, one-week and two-week courses are provided
for about 700 students each year in general trade union subjects, production and manage¬
ment subjects, industrial relations, collective bargaining, industrial finance, and social
insurance and industrial welfare. The TUC Educational Trust also provides summer
schools, regional week-end schools, and special week-end schools for women and for
young workers.
Certain unions organise one-week and other short residential courses, and these
and other unions provide week-end schools, for the education and training of officers
and members in the principles and practice of trade unionism. More than 80 unions
arrange education schemes either with the National Council of Labour Colleges or with
the Workers’ Educational Association, or with both these organisations. Scholarships
for longer-term studies (usually one academic year) at Ruskin College, Oxford, other
adult residential colleges, or the London School of Economics, are offered by the TUC
Educational Trust and by certain unions.
The TUC is recognised by the Government as the channel of consultation between
the Government departments and representatives of organised workers on matters
affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
The TUC is a non-political body, but individual trade unions can, by a ballot
vote of members, decide to set up a political fund, financed by a separate levy, which
any member can refuse to pay without loss of his normal trade union rights and
benefits. About 80 separate trade union organisations, including most of the largest
trade unions, have such a fund and, in almost every case, it is used to support the
Labour Party (or the Co-operative Party).
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local trades
council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common interest
and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year. There are more
than 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together in 22 federations.
Q
472
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level. While in some industries all matters affecting terms and conditions
of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers’ organisations
and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard procedures for
dealing with such matters by joint discussion at a national level. In many industries
there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of both sides of the
industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. There are about 200 of these
bodies, most of which are called Joint Industrial Councils. Their functions vary
considerably, some being simply negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide
range of subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is some¬
times made in their constitution that a dispute on which it is not found possible to
reach agreement should be referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by
independent persons, including the means provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896,
or the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions are not
civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are not, therefore,
in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms and conditions is based
mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual respect and vigilance of trade
unions and employers’ associations, but can be secured in particular instances through
reference to the Industrial Court (see p. 473).
At District and Factory Level. Arrangements for negotiation and discussion also exist
at district and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either
between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through
regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar bodies and
Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national level
may be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter the terms
of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may arise, and if
no solution can be found at factory or district level, refer them to the national body.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organisation among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective settle¬
ment of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their observ¬
ance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known as Wages
Councils and Agricultural Wages Boards have been set up. These are composed of
equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in the respective industries,
with the addition of certain independent members. Wages Councils may submit
proposals for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister
of Labour, who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals,
subject only to his right to return them as a whole to the council for further
consideration.
Orders relating to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate Agri¬
cultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland). Such orders are effective
only in the county agricultural wages committee area in respect of which they have
been made, but there is a national minimum enforceable in England and Wales and
also one for Scotland.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred by
agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which the
LABOUR
473
parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of Labour. Under
authority derived from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and the Industrial Courts Act, 1919,
the minister has certain powers to assist industry to settle disputes which it is not
found possible to resolve through an industry’s own machinery and procedure. These
powers are all intended to supplement and not to supersede the industry’s own
machinery.
To assist conciliation in industry, a staff of conciliation officers forms part of the
Ministry of Labour. The duties of these officers are to keep in touch with the course of
relations between employers and workers at national, district, and, in some cases,
factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle their problems by joint discussion
and negotiation.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc Board
of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established under the
Industrial Courts Act. The court normally consists of three members—the president,
one member experienced in representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves enforceable
at law, but, under the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959, reports that a
particular employer is not observing the recognised (i.e. agreed or awarded) terms
and conditions of employment in his trade or industry may be made to the Minister
of Labour by organisations which are parties to the agreement or award and are truly
representative of the employers or workers in the trade or industry concerned. If the
matter is not otherwise settled, the minister must refer it to the Industrial Court which,
after hearing the case, may issue an award requiring the employer to observe the
recognised terms and conditions. Such an award becomes an implied term of the
contract of employment. This procedure, established under the 1959 Act, replaced
an earlier one of similar intention and effect.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Com¬
mittee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These proce¬
dures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and
are not means of arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before
Parliament. Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies
are not binding on the parties, they usually provide the basis of a settlement.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation of disputes has helped to reduce the
amount of time lost in strikes and lockouts, which has been much less in the past
twenty-five years than formerly. In spite of some serious stoppages of work in the
past few years, the average time lost per year from 1932 to 1959 was only million
man-days, or about a tenth of a day per worker per year, compared with an average
of 21 million man-days in the 23 years 1910-32. The reduction has been in the size
and duration of strikes and not in their number.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
The Government is in contact with representatives of employers and workers at
all levels on matters affecting their common interests. At local and district level the
conciliation officers of the Ministry of Labour keep in touch with the representatives
of both sides of industry, while, at national level, officers of the department are requested
by many Joint Industrial Councils to attend their meetings as liaison officers. Standing
arrangements also exist for consultation between the Government, the British
Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union Congress through the National
Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
474
in which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Labour. Its membership consists of representatives of
the British Employers’ Confederation and the Trades Union Congress, together with
representatives of the managements of nationalised industries. Among the subjects
which it has considered in recent years are the machinery for settling industrial
disputes, joint consultation in industry, industrial training and recruitment, double¬
day-shift working, and the economic situation with special reference to production,
wages and prices, and the efficient use of manpower.
Joint Consultation at Factory Level
In addition to the arrangements already described, the purpose of which is mainly
but not exclusively the discussion and settlement of terms and conditions of employ¬
ment, many factories and other establishments provide for joint consultation between
management and employees through formally constituted works councils (see p. 477).
In many of the larger industries, national agreements recommend such consultation,
and in some they even prescribe model rules for its conduct.
Labour Relations of Public Authorities
While labour relations in Government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there are
some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and con¬
ditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations (trade unions)
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by means
of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p. 67), corresponding to the
Joint Industrial Councils in industry. The two sides of the National Whitley Council
are parties to a Civil Service Arbitration Agreement which, subject to certain limitations,
provides that if there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or
association may report the dispute to the Minister of Labour for reference to the Civil
Service Arbitration Tribunal. The tribunal is an independent one appointed by the
minister by virtue of his powers under the Industrial Courts Act, i9I9‘ Industrial
employees of the central Government, however, are organised by trades and not by
departments; negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of employment take
place on Trade Joint Councils and Departmental Joint Councils.
In local government services there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (e.g., manual, clerical and technical employees, and road-
menders, see p. 75) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to detailed
governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory arrangements for
collective bargaining in their industries and for joint consultation with their employees;
but in carrying out these duties they are free to choose the arrangements that suit them.
In nearly every case a complex system which already existed before nationalisation
has been taken over and modified. The arrangements, therefore, as in industry generally,
vary substantially. The main difference from private industry is that the corporations
are not members of employers’ associations. In some industries they are sole or main
employers, but even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in
air or road transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on
wage-negotiating bodies.
LABOUR
475
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally settled
by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade unions at the national
level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies, similarly representative,
charged with the duty of applying these agreements and dealing with any difficulties
or differences which may arise. Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitration
offered to industry generally by the Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail
transport have their own special arrangements.
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation in the United Kingdom is usually
based on the industry as a whole and not on the individual establishment or firm.
Accordingly, those industries, such as electricity or gas supply, where there are several
corporations which act as employers, are covered by a single set of arrangements for
each industry, and the duty of seeing that the arrangements are made falls on the
central authorities, e.g., the Gas Council or the Electricity Council. In civil aviation,
there is a single joint council at national level on which both the air corporations and the
private operators are represented. Where a single public corporation engages in
various activities, these may be treated as separate industries and organised separately.
For example, the National Coal Board’s coke and by-products plants have arrange¬
ments quite distinct from the coal mines, and the British Transport Commission’s
rail, road and water transport have their different methods based on individual tradi¬
tions, which existed before nationalisation. In road passenger transport (unlike civil
aviation) the arrangements cover only the commission’s employees; there is separate
machinery for the employees of municipal and private undertakings.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was best carried
out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate and specially con¬
stituted joint committees at all levels. In general, where consultation and negotiation
are conducted through the same machinery, separate committees exist for different
groups or grades of employees; where the consultative and negotiating arrangements
are kept apart, a single consultative committee serves all grades.
Northern Ireland
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same principles
as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of Labour and National
Insurance has powers and duties broadly similar to those of the Minister of Labour
in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade unionists in Northern Ireland are members
of trade unions whose headquarters are in Great Britain.
HUMAN RELATIONS AT THE WORK PLACE
The establishment of good working conditions is assisted by the organisation of
employers and workpeople, by arrangements for negotiation and settlement of
differences, and by protective legislation and its enforcement. This institutional frame¬
work, however, cannot by itself create satisfaction with work and working conditions,
nor the mutual trust and co-operation of management and workers, nor the sense of
shared effort and achievement known as ‘team spirit. Nor will good wages and hours,
high standards of safety and health and lavish employee services necessarily bring
about these attitudes and responses; their achievement depends rather on building up
good relations between individuals and interacting groups within the organisation.
In recent years, therefore, there has been a marked increase of interest in ‘human
relations’ in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as indivi¬
duals, as distinct from relations between organisations of employers and organisations
of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given to all aspects of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
476
personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel departments.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of organisation
of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally responsible for
advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour relations. This officer
also has particular duties with regard to recruitment, selection, education and training,
transfer of labour, the application of wage agreements, the promotion of joint
consultation and the supervision of working conditions and employee services.
Both voluntary and official organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal
with management problems and provide a service to subscribing firms, professional
associations, linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions of
management, and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
In 1945, the Ministry of Labour established a Personnel Management Advisory
Service which has done much to promote good personnel management and to assist
firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. The service is staffed by a team of
experienced personnel officers recruited from industry.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking decides
for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited by collective
agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently been attached to
selection; and courses for training personnel officers in modern interviewing techniques,
including the use of test procedures, are now well attended. Selection of applicants for
jobs is assisted by the Government Employment Services.
Since the end of the second world war, there has been an intensification of the
educational and training activities arranged by industry. Short-term training is
almost entirely the responsibility of individual firms, but in over no sections of
industry and commerce, employers and trade unions have agreed national or regional
schemes of apprenticeship and other long-term training. Further expansion and
improvement of training facilities have been urged in the report of a sub-committee
of the National Joint Advisory Council. This report, published in February 1958 under
the title Training for Skill, stressed that the increase in the number of young people
leaving school in the next few years afforded a great opportunity to increase the supply
of skilled workers and technicians, and proposed that a council should be formed by
industry to follow up its various recommendations. As the outcome, the Industrial
Training Council was established in July 1958 by the British Employers’ Confederation,
the Trades Union Congress and the boards of nationalised industries. Representatives
from the interested Government departments, the Association of Technical Institutions
and the City and Guilds of London Institute were also appointed to participate in the
council’s work. The council’s aims are to keep under review the recruitment and train¬
ing of workpeople, to provide encouragement and help to industries in dealing with
the training of workpeople, and to collect and disseminate information about aspects of
training common to more than one industry, including information about training
practices in other countries.
In 1959 the council accepted the offer of a Government grant-in-aid for the general
purpose of promoting the expansion of training for young people, and for the particular
purpose of assisting in the appointment by employers’ organisations or joint bodies of
training development officers to stimulate the setting-up of training schemes for young
people. The council can draw up to £75,000 until March 1964, the only condition being
that industry must itself match the amount of grant drawn by an equal sum. The
council issued its first report (July 1958 to December 1959) in January i960.
LABOUR
477
The realisation that the co-operation of workpeople depends largely on their proper
understanding of management’s aims and plans has focused attention on the means
of conveying information to workers. Methods used include posters, wall information
sheets, production charts, displays of photographs, the production of news-sheets and
house journals, discussions and lectures, film shows and exhibitions. It is increasingly
held, however, that, although these media have their use, it is more important to
improve communications down the normal chain of responsibility to workshop level
(a matter which depends on personal relations and on the adequacy of supervisor
training) and to establish means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
The range of subjects which works councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety, health, efficiency
of production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation and
employees’ services generally. Works councils are usually kept informed about the
state of trade and production and the firm’s prospects, and frequently consider problems
resulting from decisions to change production methods. It is the general practice,
however, to exclude all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and
other matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and workers.
The Government has assisted these developments by advice on techniques, by the
supply of posters, pamphlets, films and other publicity material, and by encouraging
and promoting joint consultation. Personnel management advisers of the Ministry of
Labour are often approached by firms seeking advice on the establishment of works
councils or on ways in which their activities can be made more effective.
The Government has sought to extend by research the available knowledge of the
factors influencing human relations in industry and human efficiency. Research units
of the Medical Research Council have worked on these problems for many years. In
1948, the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy set up a committee on industrial
productivity, and in March 1953? the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
and the Medical Research Council set up two committees concerned with research on
the human factor in industry, the Committee on Human Relations in Industry and the
Committee on Individual Efficiency in Industry.
Results of some of the sponsored researches have been appearing during the last
few years. The committees were disbanded in 1957 on completion of their terms of
office and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has appointed a new
Committee on Human Sciences (see p. 217)? while units of the Medical Research
Council are continuing research into cognate problems.
XV. SOUND AND
TELEVISION BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated under
powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1949-
I955> which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio communications, except under
licence. Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an annual licence,
which can be purchased from most post offices.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal Charter
in 1927. Television services are provided by both the British Broadcasting Corporation
and the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which was established by the
Television Act, 1954.
The number of receiving licences current in the United Kingdom at the end of
June i960 was 15,104,329, of which 10,702,131 were for sound and television combined,
and 4,402,198 (including 445,258 for sets fitted in cars) for sound only. A combined
sound and television licence costs £4 (including £1 excise duty); a sound only licence
costs ^i. Registered blind people are entitled to free sound licences or to combined
licences for £3. One licence covers all receiving sets in a household, but a separate
licence is required for a set fitted in a car.
Broadcasting Authorities
When sound broadcasting began in the United Kingdom in 1922, it was decided
in Parliament that the Postmaster General should grant only one licence for that
purpose at any one time, and the first licence was granted exclusively to a limited
company (the British Broadcasting Company). The decision to grant only one licence
for broadcasting was maintained when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
was formed to take over the functions of the limited company in 1927; it was reaffirmed
in 1937 when the BBC’s second Charter was granted to cover the sound services and
the television service which the BBC had inaugurated during the previous year;
and it was upheld throughout the second world war and during the post-war period
until 1952.
During the second world war, television broadcasting was suspended and trans¬
missions were not resumed until 1946. After resumption, however, the television
service gained rapidly both in technical efficiency and in popularity; and between 1949
and 1952 the Government instituted a major review of sound and television broad¬
casting which aroused great interest in Parliament, in the press and among the public.
After prolonged parliamentary and general discussion it was decided by the Govern¬
ment that the potential power of television was so great that it would be undesirable
to leave transmission services in this medium in the hands of a single authority,
however excellent. The Independent Television Authority was therefore established
in 1954 to provide services additional to those of the BBC for an initial period of ten
years; and independent television transmissions began in September 1955—the BBC’s
478
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING

monopoly in the provision of sound broadcasting services remaining undisturbed.1
Both the BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in so far as daily adminis¬
tration and presentation of programmes are concerned. The Government, however,
retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General, as the responsible minister, is
answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy and may issue directions to the
BBC and to the ITA on a number of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster
General also has powers to prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class
of matter, or to revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers,
however, are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are required to
publish annual reports and accounts, which are presented by the Postmaster General
to Parliament.
The BBC and the ITA both consult with the Postmaster General as to the hours
of television broadcasting, and he has approved an arrangement which permits a
maximum of 50 hours a week, together with extensions (averaging ten hours a week)
for certain stated purposes, such as religious broadcasts, ministerial and party political
broadcasts, schools broadcasts, outside broadcasts and Welsh language broadcasts.
The authorities may broadcast television programmes, within the prescribed maxima,
during any periods best suited to the needs of their audiences. The BBC broadcasts
in all four of its domestic sound services for some 18 hours out of the 24.
Organisation and Finance
The BBC operates under the provisions of two documents, each granted for limited
periods at the end of which they may be renewed or amended: the Charter, which sets
out the constitution, objects and internal organisation of the BBC and contains certain
financial provisions; and the Licence and Agreement between the BBC and the Post¬
master General, which deals with technical matters, certain non-technical conditions
such as the prohibition of commercial advertisements and sponsored programmes,
and details of the financial arrangements in force. The operations of the ITA are
governed by the provisions of the Television Act, iq54> which formulate its constitution,
its functions, its purpose and the framework of its finances; and by the Licence (which
contains technical provisions) issued to it by the Postmaster General in 1955*
The British Broadcasting Corporation
Under the current Charter (which came into force in 1952) the corporation consists
of nine governors (including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national
governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) each appointed for a period of
not more than five years by the Sovereign in Council. As a corporate body, the
governors are responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation,
including the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and television,
and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
In the discharge of its responsibilities, the BBC is required to ensure that its services
are used, as stated in the preamble to the Charter, as a means of disseminating informa¬
tion, education and entertainment’, to pay heed to the requirements of the Licence
(e.g., it must allow the broadcasting of any announcement at the request of a Govern¬
ment department, and must not broadcast commercial advertisements in any form in its
1 In July i960, the Postmaster General announced the setting up of a Committee of Inquiry
into the future of sound and television broadcasting, under the chairmanship of Sir Harry
Pilkington. Among other things, the committee will advise on the services which should in
future be provided in the United Kingdom by the BBC and the ITA, will recommend whether
additional services shall be provided by any other organisation, and will suggest what financial
and other conditions shall apply to the conduct of all these services.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

programmes without the written consent of the Postmaster General), and to refrain
from formulating or allowing the expression of editorial opinion, since to express such
opinion would be to depart from the rule of impartiality which the BBC is expected
to observe in current affairs and matters of public issue.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of councils,
established in accordance with the terms of the Charter, e.g., the General Advisory
Council, which has been in existence, except for a break during the war years, since
1934; the National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales, which, under the
chairmanship of the national governors for Scotland and Wales, are responsible for
domestic sound services in those countries; and the Regional Advisory Councils for the
English regions and for Northern Ireland. There are also a number of other councils
and committees, not specifically required by the Charter, but established by the BBC
to advise on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, music
and agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC is the Director-General, who is appointed
by the governors at their discretion and with whom they discuss all major matters of
policy and finance. Under the Director-General are six directors (the Chief Assistant
to the Director-General, and the Directors of Sound Broadcasting, Television Broad¬
casting, External Broadcasting, Engineering, and Administration) who, between
them, cover the whole work of the BBC, and who, with the Director-General, con¬
stitute its Board of Management. The number of staff employed in i960 was
approximately 16,900.
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by Parliament,
which is related to revenue derived from the sale by the Post Office of broadcast
receiving licences; (2) an annual grant-in-aid, voted by Parliament, for the External
Services, i.e. the European Services, the Overseas Services, and the Monitoring
Service; and (3) profits from BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which has a
weekly sale of about 7 million copies and attracts a large advertising revenue. The gross
revenue from the sale of licences for the year ended 31st March, i960, amounted to
£36,220,276, excluding the excise duty which is not regarded as part of the income
from licences and is not available to be spent on broadcasting.
Under the terms of a three-year agreement with the Postmaster General entered into
in 1957, the Treasury retained a percentage of the net revenue from the sale of licences,
i.e. the gross revenue less a sum deducted by the Post Office equal to the actual expenses
it incurs in collecting the licence fees, investigating complaints of electrical interference,
and administration. At the outset the Treasury retained 12^ per cent, but in response
to BBC representations that income accruing to it was insufficient for the adequate
conduct of its services, this percentage was reduced for the year 1959-60 to 7^ per cent.
Under the terms of a new agreement, in 1960-61 the Treasury will retain only 5 per
cent and in 1961-62 will retain none of the broadcast licence revenue.
In 1959-60, the Post Office deducted £2,394,060 from the gross licence revenue,
the Treasury retained £2,529,467 of the net licence revenue and the BBC received
£31,286,155. In the same year, the net revenue from publications was £1,054,629,
and grant-in-aid receipts amounted to £6,679,000.
The Independent Television Authority
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and eight ordinary members (three of whom have special responsibility for Scotland,
Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland severally) appointed by the Post¬
master General. The ITA owns and operates the transmitting stations, but the
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 481
production studios and equipment are owned, and the actual programmes are provided,
by programme companies under contract to the ITA. These companies pay the IT A
for the right to present programmes, which may include advertisements. The ITA is,
however, required by the Television Act to satisfy itself that the programmes maintain
certain standards—e.g., it must ensure that they do not offend against good taste or
decency, that they are balanced in their subject matter, that they preserve due impartiality
in presenting matters of industrial or political controversy, and that the news is
reported accurately. The ITA therefore has controlling and regulatory powers of a
wide and important character in regard to programmes and advertisements, as well as
in the choice of its programme contractors, who are selected on the basis of potential
ability to provide an efficient service and, in the case of regional companies, of their
associations with the local communities concerned.
In the discharge of its duties, the ITA is advised by three statutory committees:
the Advertising Advisory Committee; the Children’s Advisory Committee; and the
Central Religious Advisory Committee, which by arrangement with the BBC acts
as the statutory advisory body to the ITA on religious broadcasting. The ITA has
also appointed a panel of six consultants to assist it in the exercise of its day-to-day
responsibilities for religious services and programmes.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There is also a
Deputy Director-General, and a headquarters staff covering all technical, adminis¬
trative, clerical, typing and office services, which numbered 119 in June i960. Staff has
also been recruited for the transmitting stations and for regional offices, bringing the
total number of ITA staff to 349. Thirteen programme companies are under contract
with the ITA: Associated-Rediffusion Limited; Associated Television Limited;
ABC Television Limited; Granada TV Network Limited; Scottish Television Limited;
Independent Television for South Wales and the West of England Limited (TWW
Ltd.); Southern Television Limited; Tyne-Tees Television Limited; Anglia Television
Limited; Ulster Television Limited; Westward Television; Border Television
Limited; and North of Scotland Television Limited. A common news service is
provided by Independent Television News Limited. A standing consultative
committee, composed of two representatives of the ITA and a representative
of each of the programme companies, provides consultative machinery between
the ITA and the companies on matters affecting the companies as a whole, ff here
is also an Independent Television Companies Association, designed to further
the collective interests of the companies with such outside bodies as trade unions
and sporting organisations, and generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible
with one voice on public issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; its finance is drawn from annual
payments made to it by the programme companies of amounts about three times
greater than the actual cost of the engineering and administrative services it provides. In
the year which ended on 31st March, i960, these payments amounted to approximately
£3'75 million. The authority has no public debt and meets all its capital expenditure
from income. Moreover, it is estimated that by 1964 the ITA will hold debt-free
physical assets of ^5 million at first cost, on which depreciation of ^2-75 rnillion will
have been provided, and will have accumulated in addition some ^4 iffiHion ffi the
reserve fund or in other reserve income.
Sound Broadcasting
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 57 long-wave
and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from 20 permanent
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
482
very high frequency (VHF) transmitting stations, built since 1955 to provide a satis¬
factory alternative to the deteriorating reception of national and regional services on
long and medium wave lengths brought about by increased interference from foreign
stations. The external broadcasting services are transmitted from 39 high power, high
frequency transmitters: 37 in the United Kingdom and two (used for relay purposes)
at Tebrau, near Singapore.
There are 148 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 59 are in
London and 89 at various centres in the regional areas. The external services use
35 London studios. There are also 18 semi-automatic studios which can be operated
by programme officials without an engineering staff.
Domestic Services
The domestic sound services (which produce over 20,000 programme hours a year)
consist of the Home Service, the Light Programme, the Third Programme and Net¬
work Three. These separate, but inter-related, services offer the listening public a
wide and varied choice of programmes.
Each of the four services has its own characteristics: the Home Service is planned
as a general service, and in addition to a wide range of musical programmes and plays
provides the principal news and information services, discussions on domestic and
foreign affairs, political broadcasts (e.g., ministerial broadcasts and controversial
broadcasts by party spokesmen) and special programmes of various kinds, including
broadcasts for schools. It is also the vehicle for regional broadcasting (i.e. programmes
specially compiled for listeners in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the Midlands,
and north and west of England). The Light Programme is intended for those who wish
to enjoy relaxation and distraction in the least demanding form. The aim of the Third
Programme is to satisfy the intellectual and cultural interests of a minority audience;
and of Network Three to meet the practical needs (e.g., for acquiring expert information
on various aspects of hobbies or work) of groups of people, which cannot properly
be met during the evening hours by the other main services.
External Services
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link of
culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United Kingdom
and those in all other parts of the world; to present events of world-wide importance
with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British opinion and the British way of
life. These services are heard in English and in 38 other languages throughout the
world for a total, between them, of over 80 hours a day, which is longer than the output
of all the BBC’s domestic sound and television services added together, and involves
the transmission of some 43,000 news bulletins and 50,000 talks (including press
reviews) in the course of a year.
The services, under the Director of External Broadcasting, are divided into the
European Services and the Overseas Services, each in charge of a Controller. Within
these two groups are the regional divisions. Common to both groups is the External
Services News Department, which prepares all the news broadcasts for audiences
outside the United Kingdom.
The European Services broadcast over 220 programme hours a week and are
sub-divided into four regional groupings: South and West European (France,
Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Finland), East European (Soviet Union, Roumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,
Albania), and German. There is also an English Service directed to the whole
of Europe. The material broadcast by the regional services is mainly supplied by
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 483
two central departments: the European Talks Department and the European
Production Department.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe, broadcast
over 360 programme hours a week. They comprise the General Overseas Service
(started as the Empire Service in 1932) with its world-wide audience of English-
speaking listeners, and a number of regional services in English and 21 other
languages. The General Overseas Service which includes among its audience
peoples of the Commonwealth, British Forces and British communities overseas,
gives a complete programme service for 22^ hours every day. The regional
services include: the African, Caribbean, and Colonial Services; the North
American, the Pacific and the South African Services; the Arabic Service; the
Asian Services for India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Iran and the Far Eastern countries;
and the Latin American Service.
The external broadcasting services also include the Transcription Service, which
records over 700 BBC sound programmes annually and distributes them to broad¬
casting organisations in all parts of the world; the 'English by Radio' service, which
distributes English lessons with explanations in over 30 languages and reaches an
audience of several millions by direct transmission from London and by recorded
broadcasts from local stations; and the Monitoring Service, which reports foreign
broadcasts from some 35 countries and languages and works under a reciprocal
agreement with its American counterpart as regards monitored material from the Far
East and other areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
The languages and the hours of broadcasting in the external services are prescribed
by Government departments concerned with overseas relations. On appropriate
occasions, these departments are consulted about the content of the programmes, but
the final responsibility remains with the BBC.
The BBC maintains offices in New York, Paris, Berlin, Ottawa, Toronto, Sydney,
New Delhi, Singapore and Beirut, to encourage local interest in the BBC and to
provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes, whether for home
listeners about that area or for listeners in the area itself. The offices (which are con¬
cerned with the whole field of sound radio and, where appropriate, television) are
also responsible for promoting good relations with the local broadcasting organisations,
and for keeping the BBC informed about local broadcasting and other developments
of interest; in these matters, they work closely with the BBC’s Overseas and Foreign
Relations Department. Audience research is undertaken by sampling surveys and other
research methods to assess the size, nature and tastes of various audiences.
Television Broadcasting
In 1936, the BBC launched the world’s first public television service. By i960,
this service was being transmitted from 23 stations and was available to over 98 per
cent of the population. In the course of a year, it broadcasts on a national network
more than 7,000 items, made up of studio productions, outside broadcasts, films, and
relays from the continent of Europe. BBC Television Promotion undertakes the world¬
wide sale of BBC television programmes (films, tele-recordings and video-taped
material); it also purchases material for the use of the BBC television service and con¬
ducts business relations with other television organisations throughout the world.
BBC studio productions come from the London Television Theatre at Shepherds
Bush; eight main London studios; and fully equipped regional studios at Manchester,
Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast. In addition, twelve small interview
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
484
studios (used mainly for short insertions into the news) have been established in
London, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and in the north, midland and west of
England regions. The Television Film Department of the BBC is housed at the Ealing
film studios; and Television News and newsreel programmes originate from a specially
equipped studio at Alexandra Palace, London. Substantial progress has been made in
the building of the new Television Centre under construction near Shepherds Bush,
in west London: the scenery block, the restaurant block and one of the seven production
studios, together with ancillary areas, are already in use.
Outside broadcasting (which during the year 1959-60 transmitted nearly 1,000
programmes, providing over 16 per cent of the total BBC television output) covers
most parts of the United Kingdom with its mobile units, presenting programmes
both of national and of specifically regional interest, and also brings scenes of events
in Europe to viewers in the United Kingdom.
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
September 1955, by a programme transmission from the ITA London station at
Beaulieu Heights, Croydon. By the end of i960, programmes were being transmitted
from 11 stations in all parts of Great Britain, and over ten million homes in the United
Kingdom were able to receive Independent Television.
ITV programmes are produced at studio centres in London, Birmingham,
Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff, Southampton, Newcastle, Norwich, Belfast and
Dover. The establishment of these studios is the direct result of the ITA’s policy of
encouraging the development of regional television, and the programmes are either
for local broadcasting or for transmission to one or more of the other regions through
the link system operated by the ITA. In June i960, this consisted of 1,554 miles of
vision links, about 66 per cent of which were two-way circuits.
Both the BBC and the ITV services provide programmes of music, drama, light
entertainment, variety, films, news reports covering international, national, and local
events, and outside broadcasts, particularly of national and State occasions and sport.
Religious broadcasts and broadcasts for schools also feature regularly in both services,
as do programmes designed to stimulate thought and widen people s horizons, e.g.,
political discussions including party political broadcasts, interviews with outstanding
personalities, investigations into matters of public interest, and programmes on the
arts; and there are programmes of specialised interest, such as children s and family
programmes, programmes for women, regional programmes, and programmes
on agriculture.
Commercial advertising is excluded from the television programmes of the BBC,
as from its sound programmes, and the BBC seeks to avoid giving publicity to any
individual firm or organised interest except in so far as is necessary in providing effective
and informative programmes under the terms of the Charter. The ITA broadcasts
advertisements (on which the programme companies depend for their revenue) subject
to the relevant provisions in the Television Act, namely, that there should be no
sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should be clearly
distinguishable as such and recognisably separate from the programme, and that the
amount of time given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from the
value of the programmes as a medium of entertainment, instruction and information.
The ITA has also agreed rules with the Postmaster General about certain classes of
broadcasts (including, in particular, religious services) in which advertisements may
not be inserted and, on the advice of the Advertising Advisory Committee, has drawn
up certain ‘principles for television advertising’ with a view to the exclusion of mis¬
leading or unsuitable advertisements from the programmes. The cost of inserting
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING 485
advertisements in the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the programme
companies for advertising time.
Wire Broadcasting
Wire broadcasting—a system whereby radio programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers—began in the
United Kingdom in 1925 as a private venture and remains in the hands of private
enterprise. Wire broadcasting companies operate under licence from the Postmaster
General. They are not allowed to originate programmes of their own, and their function
is to distribute programmes put out by general broadcasting stations. A specified
minimum of their programme material must be taken from BBC sources. Subscribers
to wire broadcasting services must have ordinary broadcast receiving licences. At the
beginning of i960, there were 469 wire broadcasting services, of which 218 gave tele¬
vision service and the remainder sound-only service. The number of subscribers at
that date was 1,054,342, including 322,604 who were receiving television services.
Audience Research
Audience research, as conducted by the BBC, is carried on by means of (a) a Survey
of Listening and Viewing, during the course of which a representative sample of the
population is interviewed each day about its listening and viewing on the previous
day, and (b) a continuous system of gathering, through panels of representative
listeners and viewers, information about the way programmes are received by those
who happen to see or hear them. Matters outside the scope of these routine and con¬
tinuous operations are the subject of ad hoc investigations.
On behalf of Independent Television, audience research is undertaken by an
independent research organisation—Television Audience Measurement Limited—
using a machine known as a Tammeter, which is fixed to about 6,000 representative
television receivers and records the actual time these receivers are in use.
Technical Developments
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television (and very
high frequency (VHF) sound broadcasting) by the Television Advisory Committee,
which consists of an independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC, the
Director-General of the ITA, representatives from the radio industry, independent
members, and representatives of interested Government departments. In its latest
report (June i960) the committee expressed the view that the 405-line standards
now in use in the United Kingdom would not be adequate for all purposes for the
next twenty-five years and that 625-line transmissions making full use of a channel
8 Mc/s wide would offer worth-while improvements in quality over the present British
405-line transmission in a 5 Mc/s channel. It is recommended in the report that a
decision on future monochrome line standards should precede any decision on the
introduction of colour, which is not yet ready to be introduced. Changes in mono¬
chrome lines would need to be phased over several years, and no Government decision
in the matter has yet been made.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the Post Office and the radio industry. Recent studies include:
investigations into various systems of stereophonic sound transmissions giving satis¬
factory reproduction on conventional VHF receivers (the BBC has been making
experimental stereophonic transmissions since 1958); methods of improving studio
acoustics, microphones and loudspeakers; long-distance propagation studies in the
short wave, VHF and ultra high frequency bands; and methods of increasing national
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
486
coverage both in sound and television by such means as the sharing of frequencies
between stations in different parts of the United Kingdom, the construction of trans¬
mitting aerials having special horizontal radiation patterns, and the development of
unattended satellite transmitters of very low power for providing a television or YHF
sound service to small and isolated communities. Following the installation of one
such transmitter in 1958, the BBC is proceeding with the construction of 24 more for
television and 21 for VHF sound. In June 1959, the BBC inaugurated its cablefilm
system for transmitting short newsfilms over the transatlantic telephone cable.
International Relations
The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. The union,
which now has 29 active members among the broadcasting organisations in the
European zone and 17 associate members (mostly from outside Europe, including
the United States of America and many of the nations of the Commonwealth) meets
every year to exchange views and information, and to study common problems in
the programme, technical and legal fields. It also maintains a Technical Monitoring
Station, where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcasting
stations can be carried out.
Within the Commonwealth, the BBC is closely associated with the broadcasting
organisations of the other member countries and of the dependent territories. A
decision, taken at the third Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference in 1956, to
achieve still closer co-operation, resulted in the BBC joining with the Australian
Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Rank
Organisation to establish a British Commonwealth International Newsfilm News
Agency Trust. Through an associated non-profit-making company (the British Com¬
monwealth International Newsfilm News Agency Limited), this joint enterprise provides
a reliable service of international news on film for subscribers who operate television
services, produce cinematograph newsreels or acquire newsfilm for any other purposes,
including education, anywhere in the world.
The BBC also participates in the work of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency responsible for the regulation
and control of all international telecommunication services (including sound and
television), for the allocation and registration of all radio frequencies and (through
its International Consultative Committees) for the promotion and co-ordination of the
international study of technical problems in broadcasting. In addition, the BBC has
long-established relations with the United Nations Radio Division, with the United
Nations Educational and Scientific Organisation, and with the Council of Europe.
Eurovision
As well as taking part in the exchange of sound radio programmes arranged between
the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the BBC is a
regular contributor to the network of European television (Eurovision). This network
now includes thirteen Western European member countries; the exchange of tele¬
vision programmes between them is arranged by the EBU, which maintains an Inter¬
national Television Co-ordination Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. To facilitate
programme exchanges on the Eurovision network a permanent television link, operating
in either direction between London and the Continent, has been constructed by the
Post Office. The range of Eurovision is steadily increasing as countries expand their
networks and facilities, and new countries participate.

XVI. THE PRESS
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education and a
wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and interference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
It has been estimated (by UNESCO, in 1958) that for every 1,000 inhabitants of
the United Kingdom 573 copies of daily papers are sold every day. Next comes
Sweden with 462 per 1,000 inhabitants. Circulation figures of individual newspapers
are proportionately high: seven of the daily morning newspapers and six of the Sunday
papers have circulations in the millions. These high figures are largely explained by the
fact that the London morning and Sunday papers have ‘national’ circulations, i.e.
they are distributed throughout the United Kingdom, being available almost everywhere
on the day of publication.
Britain imports nearly half its newsprint requirements, while the rest is made
from imported raw materials. In i959> at>out a million tons of newsprint were used
in the United Kingdom. The average size of London national morning papers varies
between 12 and 24 pages. Prices of daily newspapers vary from 2|d. (for the majority
of papers) to 4d. (for The Times). Sunday papers run up to 44 pages and to a price of 5d.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 there are some 150 daily and Sunday
newspapers: 17 London mornings, 3 London evenings, 10 London Sundays; 18
mornings, 64 evenings and 3 Sundays in England outside London; 1 morning and
3 evenings in Wales; 6 mornings, 8 evenings and 2 Sundays in Scotland, 3 mornings
and 1 evening in Northern Ireland; 1 Isle of Man daily; and 1 morning and 2 evenings
in the Channel Islands.
There are over 1,300 weekly papers published in Greater London and almost
every sizeable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly with news
of interest to the region where they are sold. I here are also the sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in Britain,
and religious papers.
In 1947, a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the finance,
control, management and ownership of the British press. Its report was issued
in June 1949 {Cmd. 7700) and has been recognised as a comprehensive and authoritative
analysis.
The Royal Commission found that the British press ‘is completely independent of
outside financial interests and that its policy is the policy of those that conduct it ,
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was negligible .
After studying management and ownership, the Royal Commission concluded that
‘there is nothing approaching monopoly in the press as a whole, or . . . in any class
of newspaper’. Among other recommendations it suggested the establishment of a
General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see p. 494).
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the i960 edition
of The Newspaper Press Directory.

Ownership
Ownership of the press is varied: it includes individual owners, two or more partner
proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper companies owning between
one and half a dozen papers, or press groups controlling a chain of newspapers m
different parts of the country. In some cases newspaper groups also have interests in
groups of periodicals. .
While early newspapers were often family concerns (and some provincial weeklies
still are), with the development of papers for mass readership large capital sums were
needed and ownership began to be transferred to joint stock companies. The largest
press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which, with four London papers,
owns directly or through subsidiary companies a total of 14 dailies and 16 weeklies, of
which 9 dailies and 6 weeklies are linked under the management of Northcl.ffe
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
490
Newspapers Group Limited; Thomson Allied Newspapers Limited, which owns 11
dailies, 5 weeklies and 4 Sundays and whose chairman also controls Scotsman
Publications; Westminster Press Group, which controls 9 dailies and 41 weeklies;
Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns 4 dailies, 19 weeklies and one bi-weekly;
the Mirror Group, which owns a London daily and Sunday, each with Manchester
editions, one general weekly, and, through a subsidiary company, two Glasgow
dailies and one Glasgow Sunday paper; and the Beaverbrook Group, which owns a
London morning, evening and Sunday, and a Glasgow evening paper.
There are two very large publishers of periodicals in England and Wales: the
Mirror Group, controlling Fleetway Publications (formerly the Amalgamated Press),
which produces about yo periodicals and many technical publications, and Odhams
Press Limited, which controls the George Newnes Group and the Longacre Press
(formerly Hulton Press) and owns in all about 100 general, specialised, trade and tech¬
nical journals. There are other, smaller groups and publishers of single magazines.
In Scotland, the largest publishers of magazines are the Thomson-Leng Group.
Certain newspapers and periodicals are controlled by trustees whose aim is to
preserve the character and traditions of the paper and prevent control from falling
into the hands of people who might change the editorial policy and tradition. V arious
forms of trust govern the direction of The Times, The Guardian, News Chronicle and
Star, Observer, Economist, Spectator and New Statesman. Although pronounced views
may be expressed in newspapers and their political leanings may be obvious, apart
from the Daily Herald (Labour), Daily Worker (Communist) and Reynolds News
(Co-operative), they are financially completely independent of any political party.
The ‘National5 Press
Eleven morning papers with headquarters in London, and one in Manchester,
are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and there are
10 ‘national’ Sunday papers1 (see Table 41). Thirteen of these papers have northern
editions published in Manchester which after London, is the largest press centre in
England. The leading Scottish papers (see p. 491) circulate widely, and certain
specialised daily papers also have a circulation not limited by region, e.g., Lloyd's
List and Shipping Gazette and Sporting Life. The three London evening papers each
have affiliations with one of the national dailies, but they draw their readership very
largely from people living within fifty miles of London.
Provincial Newspapers
The provincial newspapers, numbering about 80 morning or evening dailies and
Sunday papers and over 900 weeklies, provide the general and local news expected
by readers whose daily life and interests are known to, and shared by, the newspaper
staff. Some 60 provincial papers still in existence were founded before 1800; the
oldest being Berrow's Worcester Journal, dating back to 1709. With a few exceptions
(e.g., Yorkshire Post, Birmingham Post, Newcastle Journal, Northern Echo, Sheffield
Telegraph, Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The total circu¬
lation of the provincial morning papers is about 2^ million, of the provincial evenings
about y£ million, and of the provincial weeklies about 12 million. Among the provincial
mornings, The Journal (Newcastle), the Yorkshire Post and the Northern Echo have
circulations of over 100,000; two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun
1 A new national Sunday paper is due to be launched early in 1961: the Sunday Telegraph,
which will be printed on the presses of the Daily Telegraph.
THE PRESS
491
(Newcastle upon Tyne), owned by Thomson Newspapers, and the Sunday Mercury
and Weekly Post, owned by a subsidiary company of the Birmingham Post and Mail
Limited—have circulations of over 200,000; while, among evening papers, the
Liverpool Echo and Evening Express has a circulation of 398,000, the Manchester
Evening News of 329,668, five (Birmingham Mail, Manchester Evening Chronicle,
Newcastle Evening Chronicle, Sheffield Star, Yorkshire Evening Post) have circulations
of over 200,000 and nine of between 100,000 and 200,000. The provincial newspaper,
often read far more thoroughly than the national daily, is a valuable medium for national
and local advertising.
There are about 90 London suburban weeklies.
Scotland
Scotland has six morning, eight evening and two Sunday newspapers; in addition,
there are separate Scottish editions of the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sunday
Express, with their own editors. The Glasgow Herald, founded in 17835 and The
Scotsman, founded in 1817 and a daily since 1855, published in Edinburgh, are among
the papers which influence serious opinion in Great Britain. The circulation of the
former is 81,196 and of the latter 66,849 (average figures January to end-June i960).
Other morning papers are The Daily Record and the Noon Record, published in Glasgow;
The Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and Aberdeen’s The Press and
Journal Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News and Evening Dispatch,
Glasgow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post,
Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock Telegraph.
The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post as well as the Scottish
Sunday Express.
Among the weekly papers are the Weekly Scotsman and The People s Journal, which
also circulate outside Scotland; in all there are 164 weekly papers published in
Scottish towns.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has three morning papers and one evening paper, all Panted
in Belfast: they are Belfast News-Letter, Northern Whig, Irish News and Belfast
Telegraph. There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, including three
published twice a week. There is also a sporting paper, Ireland s Saturday Night
published each Saturday afternoon (Belfast). The majority are published by individual
companies and all the counties have good coverage of local papers. There are no
Sunday newspapers.
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, a Thomson newspaper, is printed
and published in Cardiff; it has a circulation of over 100,000, mainly in the southern
half of Wales. In North Wales, the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events
in the area. Evening papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardi
the South Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening l ost, Swansea. No
Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and Evening Express and to a smaller extent
by evening papers published in Manchester, the Manchester Evening News and the
MSinceSOctober,T9^4,Tspecial Welsh edition of the Empire News and Sunday
Chronicle has been printed in Cardiff. The News of the World and Reynolds News carry
news about Welsh affairs written by columnists.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
492
The weekly press includes 56 weekly papers in English, many of them carrying
articles in Welsh; three bilingual papers; and nine papers in Welsh, of which five
are denominational.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have one morning paper {Guernsey Star), two evening papers
and two weeklies. The Isle of Man has one daily, a special weekly edition of which
is published on Saturday, and four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. Salient features
of the last twenty-five years have been the development, on the one hand, of periodicals
with a mass appeal, particularly those for women and adolescent girls; and, on the other
hand, the growth of the trade and technical press. There are over 4,000 periodical
publications: general magazines with circulations ranging up to over a million;
women’s magazines, some of which have even larger circulations; numerous publica¬
tions for children; a wide range of religious periodicals for all denominations; magazines
dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour; periodicals specialising in various
subjects such as politics, finance and economics, science, the professions, and the arts;
nearly 1,800 trade and technical publications, many with circulations not confined to
the United Kingdom; and the journals of learned societies, trade unions, regiments,
universities, colleges, schools, and other associations. There has also been a large
increase in recent years in the number and circulation of ‘house journals , produced by
industrial organisations mainly for their staffs; a survey made in 1958 by the British
Association of Industrial Editors estimated that some 1,500 house journals were
published, and were read by about 30 million people.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Woman (3,103,419); Woman's Own
(2,403,369); Reveille (1,855,166); Woman's Weekly (1,459,610); Weekend (1,321,213);
Woman's Realm (1,273,401); Woman's Mirror (1,018,628); together with the Radio
Times (7,002,914) and TV Times (3,945,214)- Other weeklies with sales of over 900,000
copies include Today—the New John Bull and Woman's Day. Woman and Home
(703,098) has the highest sale of popular monthly magazines.
Although their circulations are smaller, the weeklies dealing with political, social
and economic affairs enjoy a large and influential readership. The Economist covers
topics of the day from a far wider angle than its title would indicate and is politically
independent; The New Statesman is a review of politics, literature and the arts with an
independent socialist political tendency; The Spectator covers much the same subjects
and is non-party; Time and Tide has a right-wing tendency; and Tribune has a left-
wing but strongly anti-communist bias. Other papers whose circulations are in the
tens of thousands are the illustrated weeklies such as The Illustrated London A1 ezvs,
The Sphere, The Field and Country Life, while Punch is the leading humour periodical.
All these weeklies are widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specialising
in international and Commonwealth affairs.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, W ales has had,
since 1957, its own farming weekly, the Welsh Farm Aews. There are also several
monthly and quarterly publications in both the Welsh language and English.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish Field,
Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine (founded 1739)an<^ Scotland", and two weeklies
THE PRESS
493
devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish Farmer. Among literary
journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's, published in Edinburgh. Popular
magazines are numerous: the Thomson-Leng Group of Dundee alone distributes
about 10 million copies of weeklies in the British Isles and abroad.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover farming,
the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., which is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of the United
Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The owners treat their stockholding in Reuters
as ‘a trust rather than an investment’ and are bound by a trust agreement which
guarantees the independence and integrity of the news service for all time. Reuters
has correspondents in all major capitals and is associated with the principal news
agency in every country in the world. It employs several hundred staff correspondents
abroad and also has the services of more than 2,000 local journalists as part-time
correspondents throughout the world.
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British provincial
newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., a public company which distributes home
news to British papers and other subscribers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of United Press International,
an American agency.
There are also some 60 United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services with offices in London, as well as agencies in other cities, specialising
in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not so common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but there are agencies specialising in this type of work.
Training for Journalism
Until recently, and this therefore applies to most older newspapermen working
today, journalists were, broadly, of two classes: those who entered newspaper offices
on leaving school and worked their way up, learning by experience, and university
graduates who held some of the specialised posts, such as correspondents abroad or on
special subjects, leader-writers, sub-editors or reporters. The second class has always
been comparatively small. . . ,
In 1052, an agreement was reached for a comprehensive plan for the training and
education of journalists in newspaper offices. A National Council for the Training o
Journalists, on which the principal press organisations are represente , a ministers
the scheme, which is based on the voluntary co-operation of newspaper offices. I here
are regional training committees of local newspaper representatives to supervise the
operation of the scheme in provincial areas. Examinations aie taken at t\vo eve.s.
the Proficiency Test which may be taken after three years of active journalism; and
the Diploma, which may be awarded after further examination and submission of a
thesis. About 85 per cent of each year’s new intake of journalists by British newspapers
are now trained under this system.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
494
In i960, the Commonwealth Press Union launched a travelling fellowship scheme
for the training and education of young journalists throughout the Commonwealth.
Under the pilot scheme six journalists from overseas are to spend six months in the
United Kingdom: three months in the offices of newspapers or periodicals and three
months acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the employers’
side, the most important organisations are the Newspaper Proprietors Association,
whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday newspapers,
the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial daily and weekly
newspapers in England and Wales; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association; the Belfast Newspaper Society; Associated
Northern Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Proprietors’ Association, whose member¬
ship embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical publications and
general magazines. On the employees’ side there are the Institute of Journalists
(I0j)_the National Association of Journalists until 1889—incorporated by Royal
Charter in 1890, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907. The
National Union of Journalists has a membership of 15,268 (December 1959) working
journalists and is the largest trade union confined to journalists in the world; editors
who have powers of dismissal are excluded from full membership but may be associate
members. The Institute of Journalists, as it admits all qualified journalists on equal
terms of membership, may claim to be representative of the profession as a whole.
Free-lance journalists (who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers, but
send contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. The aims of these
organisations are the improvement of the economic status of journalists, the promotion
of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of the status of the press and
its editorial staffs. _ .
The aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are, inter aha, to sustain the
dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors, to
protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the education and training
of journalists: the guild has over 300 members. The British Association of Industrial
Editors is the professional organisation to which most editors of house journals belong.
The Typographical Association, in the provinces, and the London Typographical
Society, in London, are the principal craft unions organising such workers as
compositors and machine minders. The National Union of Printing, Bookbinding
and Paper Workers is principally concerned with the publishing and distribution
side, and the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA)
includes machine assistants, clerical workers and general assistants in printing works.
These unions cover the printing industry generally.
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Press, a Press
Council representative of the various press organisations was set up in I953-
aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British press;
to maintain the character of the British press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
THE PRESS 495
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British press which may tend towards greater con¬
centration or monopoly; and
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British press and the factors affecting
them. Reports are published annually.
The council consists of eight editorial representatives, four nominees of the National
Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of Journalists, and ten managerial
representatives.
The work of the Press Council has been largely concerned with complaints of
unjustifiable intrusion by the press into the private lives of individuals, including
members of the Royal Family, or other breaches of professional standards, and with
the admission of the press to meetings of local authority councils and to hearings of
administrative tribunals.
The Press and the Law
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say what it
likes provided it does not transgress the law; and, in general, it enjoys very great
liberty of comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers, there are no laws applying
to the press in particular and not to the general public; but requirements which affect
journalists and the press occur in a variety of Acts of Parliament: for example, the
Public Bodies (Admissions to Meetings) Act, i960, and other Local Government Acts
govern the admission of the press (and the public) to meetings of local councils,
and restrictions on the reporting of domestic proceedings and proceedings concerning
juveniles are imposed by legislation governing procedure in the law courts, ihe
press must comply with the copyright laws and with the laws against the publication
of matters covered by the Official Secrets Acts, with the laws of seditious libel, blas¬
phemous and obscene libel, and defamation, with the laws for the protection of
children from publications which might do them moral harm, and with the laws against
fraudulent advertising, against breach of parliamentary privilege, and against contempt
of court’—for example, the publication of anything affecting a case before the courts
which might tend to influence the result of the trial, or of comment on court proceedings
which might tend to prejudice their reputation for fairness. ,
Legal proceedings against the press are infrequent; the majority of actions that do
take place are brought by private individuals seeking to protect their own interests
for example, against libel. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, pu is er, prm er an
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be held
responsible.
XVII. SPORT
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such pursuits as organised
games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games, aquatic sports, and such
other activities as horse-racing, dog-racing, show-jumping, riding, boxing, rock climb¬
ing, motor racing, cycling, and rifle shooting. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals, i.e. paid players, or they may be amateurs, i.e. people who play games
or take part in other forms of sport usually in their leisure time and without monetary
reward. Professionals keep up the technical standards of the sports in which they take
part1 and spectators make a vital contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial
support; but the sporting life of Britain derives its character principally from the
amateur element—the many thousands of boys and girls and men and women who
engage in sport solely for pleasure.
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion of
sport, but it gives encouragement and support to physical education through the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department, and it allocates
grants from public funds to bodies responsible for the provision of playing fields
and other facilities for physical recreation, and to national sporting organisations
towards the cost of appointing instructors (coaches) in various kinds of sport.
The Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland, although not
responsible for prescribing the curricula in any school, require that all schools receiving
financial assistance from public funds shall provide for the physical education (c.g.,
gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils, and are con¬
cerned, through inspectors of physical education and by means of departmental
publications, that a high standard shall be maintained. All schools in the national
system must have their own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary
schools have a gymnasium. Facilities for, and instruction in, most kinds of sport are
also provided at the independent preparatory and public schools, and at the universities
(some of which have departments of physical education).
The Ministry of Education is closely associated with the Central Council of Physical
Recreation (see p. 177), and the Scottish Education Department is similarly associated
with the corresponding Scottish body, the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation
(see p. 177). Both the ministry and the department also co-operate with the National
Playing Fields Association (see p. 177). Local authorities are empowered, under the
Public Health Acts and the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937, to provide
playing fields. They also provide gymnasia, lawn tennis courts, golf courses and
swimming baths on a varying scale. # .
The games and sports described in this chapter are the most popular in Britain,
judged by the numbers of participants and spectators, but the list is not an exhaustive
one. Outdoor games such as croquet and curling, indoor games such as darts and |
skittles, aquatic sports such as canoeing, punting and water ski-ing, and such pursuits
1 Some sports, for example, athletics, Rugby football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur,
but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur status is gradually becoming
less strictly defined.
496
sport 497
as archery, fencing, flying, gliding, ice-skating, ski-ing and pot-holing, all have their
particular following and are part of the British sporting scene.
Outdoor Games
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football, cricket,
and hockey, and games, e.g., lawn tennis and golf, in which individuals or couples
match their skill. Judged by the number of participants and spectators the most
popular of the team games are football and cricket, and the most popular of the
individual games is lawn tennis.
Football
Although football of a kind was played as long ago as the Middle Ages (and there
are even earlier records), as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago.
One type of football, in which the feet only are used, was adopted at Cambridge in
1855; the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, from which it derives its name, and was adopted by the Blackheath
football club in 1859.
In England and Wales, the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football (colloquially known as ‘soccer’) is the Football Association (FA), which was
formed as a limited, non-trading company in 1863. The association’s chief function
is to promote and protect the interests of the game and to prevent infringement of the
agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising young players and organises
various matches and competitions, including the international matches played by
England, the Amateur Cup competition, two national youth competitions, and the
competition for its own leading trophy—the Football Association Challenge Cup. Over
350 clubs are registered with the FA—more than 200 as full members and between
130 and 140 as associate members. The FA derives its main income from subscriptions,
international matches and the receipts of the FA Cup and Amateur Cup, and ploughs
back a large portion of the money into the game in various ways. Scotland and Northern
Ireland have their own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football Association, which is
responsible for the organisation of international games and the Scottish Football
Cup fixtures; and the Irish Football Association.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played weekly) are
controlled by the Football League, which comprises the major professional clubs in
these countries. The funds of the League are derived largely from contributions
paid by all member clubs in the form of a levy of 4 per cent of the net gate receipts
from all league matches, after allowable expenses have been deducted, and from annual
payments (approximately £250,000, of which some £80,000 is passed to the Scottish
League) from the leading football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists.
In Scotland, the Scottish Football League is in charge of the weekly games; Northern
Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish Leagues are
organised in divisions, the members of which compete against one anot er or t e
respective league championships. Their positions in the divisiona ta es are eci e
at the end of the season by the number of points gained for wins or draws. In the
season 1959-60, a total of nearly 33 million people watched league oot a mate es
and the gate receipts in all amounted to about £4^ million. . ,
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the matches in the
league competitions by filling in what are known as pools coupons > t e aggrega e
sum staked during the 1959-60 season was over £90 million. The odds against winning
anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes, which are tax free, are extreme y
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
498
high—in a season, individual payments of £300,000 may occasionally be made. The
promoters of the pools deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and
expenses, including payments to the leagues.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis, and any
team, whether or not a member of the league, can enter. The final—the Cup Final—
is the most important football match of the year in England; it is always played at
Wembley Stadium, near London, which can accommodate some 100,000 spectators.The
Scottish Cup Final is played at Hampden Park, in Glasgow. The international matches
between England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, in which distinguished amateur players
sometimes appear, also excite great interest, as do the matches between British teams
and teams from European and South American countries.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are pro¬
fessionals (the comparative figures are about 650,000 amateurs, including schoolboys
and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals), but with one or
two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal terms, since professional
teams are more systematically and intensively trained. Amateur teams compete against
each other for the Football Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby football, or ‘rugger’, is played under the auspices of the Rugby Union (a
controlling body with functions similar to those of the Football Association), which
was established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely different from those
that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11, in a side. International
matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France are played regularly
at the leading rugby football grounds of each country, including Twickenham, London
—the headquarters of the Rugby Union. Other important rugger matches are: the
county championship competitions; the annual match between the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge; the Hospitals’ Cup final; and the Services Challenge Cup final.
Seven-a-side football (a variant of Rugby football) is also played by clubs and in
English and Scottish secondary schools.
Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly confined to amateur clubs, but in the
north of England there is a professional variant of the game played by teams of 13
instead of 15, according to the rules of the Rugby League, which was instituted
in 1895. The Rugby League holds frequent international matches as well as regular
inter-county competitions. The match for its highest trophy the Rugby League
Challenge Cup—is played at Wembley and is attended, on average, by some 75,000
spectators.
Cricket
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin is
not recorded, but it is known that the game was played by the boys of Guildford
Grammar School during the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth
century it had gained greatly in popularity both in the villages of England and on the
larger country estates.
The game has been played more or less as it is played today since the adoption
of a generally accepted set of laws in 1744- About i75°> a cricket club was formed in
the little Hampshire village of Hambledon; within 20 years it had made an outstanding
name for itself and acquired a membership representative of patrons of cricket from
all over England. In 1787, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), now the governing
body of cricket, was founded, with its headquarters in London on a site rented by a
Yorkshireman called Thomas Lord. In the year 1809-10, the MCC moved its head¬
quarters to a ground near Regent’s Park, keeping the name Lords’, four years later
SPORT
499
Lords transferred to another ground, at St. John’s Wood, in the same neighbourhood,
where it has remained ever since.
Following the establishment of the MCC, the laws of cricket became stabilised;
other clubs that sprang up all over England during the nineteenth century recognised
its authority, and nowadays all cricket is played according to the ‘laws of cricket’
as laid down by the MCC in consultation with cricketing organisations in Britain and
the overseas Commonwealth.
In England, cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all towns and
villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a week during the
season—roughly May to September. There are many thousands of cricket grounds
all over England—in the London area alone nearly 400 pitches are provided by the
county council besides many leased or owned by various well-established clubs.
Apart from the university match between Oxford and Cambridge and certain
representative games, such as Gentlemen versus Players, i.e. amateurs versus pro¬
fessionals, the greater part of first-class cricket is played in a county championship
between seventeen ‘first-class counties’. (The other counties have a minor counties
championship’ of their own.) Among famous grounds are the Oval, Kennington,
London, headquarters of the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester;
Headingley, Leeds; Trent Bridge, Nottingham; and Lords centre of cricket throughout
the world.
In the late nineteenth century, more amateurs played cricket than economic con¬
ditions in the twentieth century allow. Nowadays, when first-class matches last three
days and each county plays between twenty and thirty matches in a season, most county
players are professionals, although there are still some amateurs who can afford the
time to play regularly. League cricket, which is a feature of the game in the north of
England, is played by teams mainly consisting of amateur Saturday afternoon players
with one or more professionals, many of whom are distinguished players from other
Commonwealth countries. The MCC is an entirely amateur body, although retired
professional cricketers of ‘the highest merit’ are elected to honorary membership
of the club. , , 11
In addition to county championships, matches known as test matches are played
regularly between a number of Commonwealth countries. The first of these matches
was played at Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, between England and Australia. Present-
day test matches are played by England against Australia for a mythical trophy called
the ‘Ashes’, and also against South Africa, New Zealand, the West Indies, India an
Pakistan. These matches last 30 hours (spread over five or six days) and are played
alternately in England and in the country of the opposing eleven; they arouse great
popular interest and are widely reported in the press and on sound radio and television.
Hockey . . .
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain for at
least five centuries and perhaps even longer; a haphazard form was played ,n schools
before football became popular, and many hockey clubs wercto be found in e
London area during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Modern hockey, how¬
ever, dates from the formation (in 1886) of the Hockey Association which ^ndardised
the rules. Nowadays there are several hundred hockey clubs affiliated to the Hockey
Association and a county championship was instituted in 1957, but thc game has
never attracted the same wide public interest as football and cricket, and there a e
no professional county teams and no cup-ties. On the other hand, regular ama eur
international matches (inaugurated in .894) are played between England, Scotland,
500
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ireland and Wales, with overseas countries, e.g., France, the Netherlands, and Denmark,
sometimes taking part.
In Britain, hockey is more commonly played by women than by men. The con¬
trolling bodies are: the All England Women’s Hockey Association (founded 1895) to
which are affiliated some i,55° schools and about 950 women’s clubs; and the
Scottish Women’s Hockey Association. The first international women’s hockey match
took place in 1896. Nowadays, one such match is always played at Wembley Stadium,
and may be attended by as many as 50,000 spectators.
Lacrosse
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North America,
is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and at universities.
International matches are played, as well as regional matches by women’s teams repre¬
senting the east, west, south, north and midlands of England, under the auspices of
the All England Ladies Lacrosse Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse Union, is
played in seven universities, and by clubs and schools, mainly in the London and
Manchester areas. County matches are played and there is an annual fixture between
the North of England and the South.
Netball
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the All
England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county associations, the
netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of the national youth
organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home international matches are
played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours are arranged.
Polo
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British in
India, and brought to England by the 10th Hussars in 1869. The governing body of
British polo is the Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth polo
associations are affiliated.
Polo players are a very small section of the community, for the cost of the purchase
and upkeep of polo ponies is very high. However, many of the clubs now own trained
ponies which are hired out to members at moderate cost, thus enabling promising
young players with only modest incomes to learn and play polo. There are about 500
players handicapped by the Hurlingham Polo Association, and the number is growing.
Public interest in polo has increased greatly since the end of the second world
war, and large numbers of spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches
between high-handicap teams composed of players from several countries. The better
known polo grounds are those at Cowdray Park, Sussex; Windsor Great Park; Ciren¬
cester Park, Gloucestershire; Tarporley, Cheshire; and Tidworth on Salisbury Plain.
Lawn Tennis
A form of tennis has been played out of doors from the earliest times; but modern
lawn tennis dates from about 1873, when it began to take its place with cricket as one
of the British national summer games. In 1877, ^ words ‘and lawn tennis’ were added
to the title of the All England Croquet Club at Wimbledon and in the same year the first
championships were played; the Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the
game in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the world is
the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with headquarters in London and Paris.
SPORT
501
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during the past
sixty years; the game is played nowadays in most secondary schools (particularly in
girls’ schools) throughout the summer months, by families in their own gardens, and
at the innumerable tennis clubs that exist throughout Britain. Many local authorities
also provide tennis courts in parks and recreation grounds, where members of the
public may play at a very low cost.
The annual amateur championships, held for two weeks at the end of June and
beginning of July, at Wimbledon, London, are the main event of the lawn tennis
season. These championships, for which men and women of many nationalities com¬
pete, draw large crowds; there is accommodation for over 30,000 spectators in the
grounds of the Wimbledon Club where the matches are played—14,000 can be accom¬
modated round the centre court where the championship finals take place. Other
tournaments which attract public attention are: the British Hardcourt Champion¬
ships; the British Junior Championships, in which boys and girls compete; the County
Championships; the Service Championships; and the matches for the Public Schools’
Cup. An important international event is the tournament for the Davis Challenge Cup
(for men). Britain and the United States of America also compete annually for the
Wightman Cup (for women).
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other countries
of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth century. Since then,
however, it has gained steadily in popularity, and nowadays there are golf courses in the
vicinity of many towns and villages—some owned by local authorities, but the majority
owned by golf clubs. The headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is
St. Andrews, Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship, which
was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker Cup (for amateurs)
and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played between Britain and America;
the Amateur Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Bowls
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. Nowa¬
days the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling Association is
concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded in i9°5- The Bowling
Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come under and play to the laws as
laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling associations in England the English
Bowling Federation, the Crown Green Association and the English Women s Bowling
Association—which are not under the IBB’s control.
During the summer, bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in winter, it is
played on indoor greens, of which there are an increasing number throughout the
country. At one time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game has gained
immensely in popularity during recent years; over 2,400 bowling clubs in 34 counties
of England are affiliated to the English Bowling Association alone, and international
and inter-county matches are played.
Athletics
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country), relay
racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by the Amateur
Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to encourage, promote and
502
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
control amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic meetings by
the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual championship
matches. The association, whose membership increased rapidly from small beginnings,
is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers and managed by
representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland, Southern and Welsh
areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur athletic clubs, schools and
youth organisations), of which there are hundreds throughout England and Wales.
The AAA employs five full-time national coaches, towards the cost of which it receives
grants from the Ministry of Education. These coaches conduct courses, including
courses at a summer school, for teachers and athletes wishing to qualify by examination
as honorary coaches; some 2,000 qualified honorary coaches give voluntary services in
the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have
their own amateur athletic associations, with functions analogous to those of the
AAA; there are also separate Women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United Kingdom
are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is composed of representa¬
tives of the three national associations for men and of the Women’s Council, and is
affiliated to the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
Track meetings of athletics are held throughout Britain from April to October.
The main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men and
international matches held at the White City, London; area and county champion¬
ships; and the universities, Services, business houses and schools championship
meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running from October to March,
and international, county and area cross-country championships are held.
Teams representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland compete in the Olympic
Games (held every four years), and separate teams representing England, Wales,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, the most
recent of which were held at Cardiff, in Wales, in 1958.
Highland Games. The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people
in the Highlands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting
the weight, and throwing the hammer), and dancing and piping competitions take
place. Among the better known Highland games are the Northern Meeting at Inverness,
the Braemar Gathering on Deeside (traditionally attended by the royal family), the
Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the meeting at Aboyne. The Highland games
attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world.
Country Sports
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable part in the
life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their interests is the British
Field Sports Society.
Hunting
In Britain hunting means primarily hunting the fox, on horse-back with a pack of
hounds especially bred for the purpose, but it also includes stag-hunting, which
preceded fox-hunting and is still pursued—mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting
the hare, either on foot with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted;
and otter-hunting along the banks of rivers.
Fox-hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for the
landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in spite of the
SPORT
503
fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds, unless they are farmers.
Farmers now outnumber all other riders in the hunting field, but a large number of
people, including many who live in towns, take a keen interest in the sport and follow
hounds, in cars, on bicycles or on foot.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales, 26 in
Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from the large establishments
in the ‘shires’, i.e. the midlands of England (e.g., the Belvoir, the Cottesmore, the
Quorn, and the Fernie) where mounted followers may be two hundred or more, to
small kennels in the west and north, where hunting is often on foot.
The fox-hunting season proper starts in early November and lasts until April; it is
preceded by cub-hunting, i.e. the hunting of young foxes, when young hounds are
taught the science of hunting. Meets of the fox-hounds, held on village greens, at
cross-roads, or in the grounds of country houses, and attended by many people who
do not intend to ride to hounds, are one of the most picturesque sights of the winter
countryside. At the end of the season, most hunts organise steeple-chases, known as
point-to-points, which are patronised by large crowds.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with the aid
of the farmers, whose support enables fox-hunting to continue to flourish; sometimes,
however, the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge of the hunt, must
bear a proportion of the cost.
Shooting
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the early
part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of grouse, partridge,
pheasant and wildfowl (duck and geese) although in some areas it also includes snipe,
woodcock, wood pigeons and hares.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In the first
place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and purchased annually
(the latest returns of gun licences issued in the United Kingdom give a total of over
290,000), and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on privately owned land,
shot over either by the owner and his friends or by syndicates who have leased the
shooting. However, in some parts of the more remote countryside, rough shooting
may be enjoyed in a less formal way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled
by the Wildfowling Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through
its numerous clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other game birds are ‘preserved’; that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected under the game
laws and allowed to breed in security, under the care of privately employed game-
keepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant seasons open on
12th August, 1 st September and 1st October, severally, and last for between four
and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly in Scotland, northern England
and North Wales, where the main grouse moors are to be found; partridge and
pheasant shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on the
marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
A Game Research Association was founded in i960 by a group of landowners,
farmers and others interested in game conservation to take over part of the work on
game research previously carried out by Imperial Chemical Industries, to collect and
collate information on a national scale and make a detailed study of factors
controlling game population, including diseases to which game birds are subject, game

ecology and density, survival rates and movements of game in changing environments.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get an effective
shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a keen scent, are far¬
sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly a sport of the Highlands of
Scotland. The deer are preserved (the close season lasts from June to October) on
privately owned tracts of land known as ‘deer forests’, although some of them are
almost devoid of trees; deer forests range in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres.
Fishing
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach of
everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and line to the
experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in their leisure hours than
hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing. Trout (
streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland there are also
many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon fishing may be enjoyed
on many rivers in England and North Wales, but the best salmon rivers are to be
found in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, the most widely
practised form of fishing is for coarse fish (e.g., pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream), and the National Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 350,000
members. Match angling—competitive fishing for coarse fish by weight—is a feature
of the many angling clubs affiliated to the NFA, particularly in the midlands and north
of England; a national angling championship, composed of no teams of 12 anglers,
is organised annually by the NFA; and the NFA enters a team in the International
Angling Competition.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea fishing for
tuna and shark has gained many adherents since the end of the second world war.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all, but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has
to be paid for and local inquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most
coarse fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a stretch of
river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or pay for the right to fish
by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon fishing is often high.
Indoor Games
Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton, which
are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are provided in
social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games such as real tennis (a
game which originated in thirteenth-century France), squash rackets, rackets ax\d fives,
which are less national games than games of the schools, universities and specialised
clubs. Annual championships are held in all these games, the controlling bodies of
which are: the Billiards Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association
of England and the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives
Association and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of
netball which originated in the United States of America during the nineteenth
century, is also played in Britain, primarily by men. Matches in the game are included
among the Olympic events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket
Ball Association.
Aquatic Sports
The most commonly practised of the aquatic sports are rowing, sailing and swimming.
All three are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
SPORT
5°5
Rowing
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community, and
as a sport, it arouses considerable public interest. The two annual rowing events
which excite the greatest enthusiasm are the University Boat Race, which originated
in 1820 and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-on-
Thames in Oxfordshire. Considerable interest is also shown in the Head of the River
Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which between 200 and 300 eights row
in procession—the largest assembly of racing craft in the world—and in the regattas
held at many riverside resorts every summer.
The University Boat Race, which provides one of the sights of London, is between
eight-oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4J miles between
Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters gathered
on both sides of the river. Victory in the boat race is a much-coveted honour, but the
winning eight receives no tangible award.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various kinds of
races rowed over a straight course of one mile 550 yards are arranged, e.g., for the
Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any nation, the Silver Goblets
for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single scullers, and the Ladies Challenge Plate,
open to crews from schools and colleges in the United Kingdom.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggett’s Coat and Badge,
founded in 1716. Originally a race for professional watermen and limited, until recently,
to six entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be appren¬
tice watermen) and, if necessary, may be rowed in heats. The course is from London
Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing clubs,
including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as well as men
compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur Rowing Association
is the governing body of the sport.
Sailing
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the inland
waters and round the coasts of Britain, but since the end of the second world war
the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal. Sail
numbers registered in the Royal Yachting Association’s small boat classes in June
i960 were: International Fourteen Foot, 738; National Eighteens, 237; Enterprise,
5,145; Firefly, 2,564; Merlin Rocket, 1,133; Redwing, 217; Swordfish, 202; Twelve
Foot, 1,899; and there is an even greater number of still smaller sailing boats not
included in the register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Association,
subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded in 1907. The
main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta at Cowes in the Isle
of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron, founded in 1812. Other
events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and the races arranged during the
special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset,
Bembridge in the Isle of Wight, Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-
Crouch in Essex, Plymouth in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish
river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules drawn up
by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses are: Cowes to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
5°6
Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente Maritime, France),
and Harwich to the Hook of Holland. A number of British yachtsmen also took part
in a single-handed race across the Atlantic which was held for the first time during i960.
The famous yacht race between Britain and America for the America’s Cup
(originally given by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1851 and presented in 1857 to the
New York Yacht Club for competition by the owners of America, the winner of the
cup in 1851) is now held at increasingly long intervals, owing to the expense involved.
The cup has remained in America since the institution of the race, the last challenger
being the British yacht Sceptre, in 1958.
Swimming
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the seaside,
and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people. The existence of
indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming possible for devotees of the
sport. Considerable interest is taken in underwater swimming, and there are several
clubs to which enthusiasts may belong. National and international swimming and
diving championships are held annually—the controlling body in England is the
Amateur Swimming Association, and in Scotland, the Scottish Amateur Swimming
Association. The association is also the controlling body for water polo, a team game
played in swimming pools, which originated in Britain around 1880. The Olympic
Games include international water polo matches.
Attempts to swim the Channel between various points on the coasts of France and
England—some of which are successful—are made by swimmers of many nationalities
every summer.
Racing
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean first and foremost, horse-racing.
Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing, pony-racing, trotting races,
and pigeon-flying.
Horse-racing
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the Jockey
Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and even earlier.
The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded in 1866) now exercise
control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in many other countries,
and their rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till November
under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeple-chasing, conducted under the
rules of the National Hunt Committee.
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies, run on
the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand Guineas for
fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and fillies, run at Epsom;
the Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the St. Leger for colts and fillies, run
at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding event in the racing calendar; it takes place
annually in early June and the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most
colourful and exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the
flat racing season takes place on the course at Ascot in Berkshire. This meeting, which
is held in mid-June, is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, and is traditionally attended by the
Sovereign. The races for the Gold Cup and the Royal Hunt Cup are run during the
June Ascot week.
SPORT
S°7
The best known steeple-chase is the Grand National, first run in 1839, an^ run
annually since then over the Aintree course near Liverpool. The race, which draws
immense crowds and arouses widespread interest (and some criticism) tests the skill,
stamina and courage of both horse and rider to the utmost. Most steeple-chase meetings
are held during the period September to May, one of the most important being the
National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire, early in March.
In England and Wales there is racing on 66 racecourses (excluding point-to-point
courses), at which there are approximately 650 days’ racing annually; Scotland has
seven racecourses, where racing takes place on an average of 50 days in the year. There
are approximately 7,500 horses in training in Great Britain, at an average cost of 10 to
11 guineas a week each.
Horse races must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National Hunt Committee.
Where a totalisator is operated, a certificate of approval is required from the Race¬
course Betting Control Board, set up under the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928. From
the money staked on the totalisator, the Board is empowered to deduct such percentage
(at present approximately 10 per cent of the total stakes) as it may determine, and the
revenue secured in this way is applied, after payment of the Board’s operating expenses
and taxation, for the improvement of racing and horse breeding and the advancement
of veterinary science and education. In 1959, some £600,000 (tax free) was assigned
in this way. The Betting and Gaming Act, i960, gives the Board additional powers
by laying down that facilities for carrying on pool betting and betting at tote odds on
horse races shall be provided only with its authority; and it is hoped that this will
enable the Board to obtain further revenue for the benefit of racing.
Betting between bookmakers and members of the public is legal without restriction
(except that no young person under the age of eighteen may place a bet) on all courses,
and provision for such betting must be made on courses approved by the Racecourse
Betting Control Board. Bookmakers and their assistants are charged for admission
to an enclosure on a racecourse; during the year ended 31st July, 1959, racecourses
received over £450,000 from this source.
Until recently, off-the-course betting was legal only by telephone on credit, but the
Betting and Gaming Act, i960, has made provision for the establishment by the Race¬
course Betting Control Board and bookmakers of betting offices where members of
the public over eighteen years of age can go to place bets in cash. A further scheme
to provide more money for racing is a levy on off-the-course bookmakers, based
on the size of their business, to be assessed and collected by a Bookmakers Levy
Board.
Greyhound Racing
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926, when
the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester. There are
now some 200 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are situated in or on the
outskirts of large towns. Racing usually continues throughout the year (although betting
is limited by the Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934, to 104 days in any year), and meetings
(which usually consist of eight races) are generally held two or three times a week.
The licensing authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and county
borough councils. Some twenty million people a year visit the tracks.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club, founded
in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound racing and exercising
strict discipline over all aspects of the sport. The National Greyhound Racing Society
—an association of 65 of the leading tracks, which was also founded in 1928, accepts
5°8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the rules of the National Greyhound Racing Club. Most of the classic greyhound races,
including the Derby at the White City, the Laurels at Wimbledon, the St. Leger at
Wembley, and the Cesarewitch at West Ham, take place in the London area, although
many other large centres have their ‘big’ nights.
There is a considerable volume of betting at greyhound race-meetings, both with
bookmakers and on the totalisator. Under the 1934 Act, the occupier of any licensed
greyhound track is empowered to operate a totalisator on the 104 ‘appointed days’
and to deduct not more than 6 per cent of the stake money for operating expenses
before successful backers are paid, in addition to the 10 per cent tax payable to the
Government in respect of bets placed through the greyhound totalisator. The Betting
and Gaming Act, i960, provides that the ‘copyright’ in tote odds granted to the Race¬
course Betting Control Board in respect of horse-racing shall also apply to the
occupiers of licensed greyhound tracks.
Riding
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase steadily, and many more
people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the second world
war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There are several hundred
riding schools in Britain, many of a high standard; membership of the British Horse
Society has risen to over 10,000; some 150 riding clubs have been established since
1945; and the Pony Club (open to young people up to the age of seventeen years)
now has well over 30,000 members. There are over 600 branches of the Pony Club
throughout the wTorld, of which more than 200 are attached to hunts in Britain, and
the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the national equestrian federation of Great Britain,
is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including breeding,
training, riding, showjumping and dressage, and is responsible for preparing equestrian
teams for the Olympic Games and all international events. The Society is also the parent
body of the Pony Club and the riding clubs, and in this capacity it organises and provides
tests, lectures, demonstrations, courses and examinations to further the knowledge
and raise the standards of British horsemanship and horsemastership.
Horse trials as well as hunter trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during
the spring and summer. The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton
Park, Gloucestershire, and in September at Harewood, Yorkshire—are among the
outstanding equestrian events of the year. These trials include dressage, cross-country
riding, and showjumping; some 25 one-day trials on similar lines are held annually.
Show Jumping
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The main
events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at the White
City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society towards the end of
July)—the outstanding contest being the individual jumping championship for the
King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competitions are also a feature of the Horse
of the Year Show, which takes place every October (since 1959, at Wembley) and is
acknowledged to be one of the finest indoor horse shows in the world.
Since the end of the second world war, show jumping has attracted vast audiences
and has increased greatly in popularity. Total membership of the British Show
Jumping Association has risen to well over 7,000, the number of horses and ponies
registered is approximately 5,000 and over £100,000 is distributed annually in
prize money.
SPORT
509
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international competitions
(whose successes have materially contributed to the increased popularity of show
jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee of the association.
Boxing
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern form,
and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates from 1865 when
the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which eliminated much of the
brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting, and made the basis of the sport a
trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there are various
amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules of the Amateur
Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur boxing, including schoolboy
boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control, founded
in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for the examination
of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of inspectors to ensure that the
regulations are observed and that all contests are ‘vetted’ to safeguard against over¬
matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests since the
presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late Lord Lonsdale in 1909.
Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at ten weights: flyweight, bantam¬
weight, featherweight, lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight, light middleweight,
middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight. The fixed weights in professional
boxing are the same, except that there are no light welterweight or light middle¬
weight classes.
Wrestling
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world, dating as far back as 430 B.c.
The style most commonly used in Britain nowadays is the ‘free’ style, which evolved
from the Catch-as-Catch-Can or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland
wrestling is still practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style
wrestling (in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all the holds
must be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-Roman styles
are used at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games only free style
is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur Wrestling Associa¬
tion, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling Federation, under the
rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’
or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo,
a Japanese form of wrestling, has a large following, and is governed by its own
associations; it is an effective form of defence against physical or armed assault.
Mountaineering
Mountaineering in Britain consists mainly of fell (or hill) walking, rock climbing,
and, in winter when conditions are suitable, snow and ice climbing on the higher hills
of Scotland, northern England and North Wales. Rock climbing is practised on the
crags of Snowdonia in North Wales, in the Highlands of Scotland, Skye, the English
Lake District, and Derbyshire, as well as on many smaller outcrops. Climbs are
graded from ‘Easy’ to ‘Exceptionally Severe’—the technical difficulties of the higher
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
510
grades compare with any that occur in other parts of the world. The popularity of
mountaineering has increased enormously since the end of the second world war,
and a very large number of clubs (ranging from purely local organisations to large
bodies such as the Climbers’ Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club, and the Fell
and Rock Climbing Club) exist throughout the country. The Alpine Club, founded
in London in 1857, is the oldest mountaineering club in the world; the representative
body of the sport is the British Mountaineering Council; the Mountaineering Associa¬
tion organises courses of instruction in climbing both in Britain and the Alps. Short
courses for boys and girls over twelve years old and for adults are held at a privately
owned mountaineering school opened in 1959 in North Wales.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the great ranges
of the world and in climbing their peaks, e.g., the first ascent of the Matterhorn in
i865, the first ascent of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga in 1955.
Motor Racing
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more racing
and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other country; and British
drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and world
classic races which are the main features of the sport, and include the British classic
races—the British Grand Prix, and the Tourist Trophy for sports cars, which was
first held in 1905 in the Isle of Man and later at Dundrod in Northern Ireland, and
now takes place on the circuit at Goodwood, Sussex. There are also several British
national race meetings (16 in 1959) and British national rallies (8 in 1959), as well as a
large number (over 2,500 in 1959) °f day and night rallies and trials, endurance tests,
hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which there are
over 500 in Great Britain.
The best known motor racing circuits (in addition to that at Goodwood) are those
at Silverstone, Northamptonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch, Kent;
Snetterton, Norfolk; Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park, Cheshire; Aintree,
near Liverpool; and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in Scotland. The controlling body of
motor racing in Britain is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), founded in 1897; the
RAC is represented on the Federation Internationale de I’Automobile, which draws
up the regulations for international motor racing.
In addition to motor car racing, motor cycle races are held—the most important
contest of the year is that for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and motor cycle speed¬
way racing, which was introduced into Britain in 1928, and is governed by the
Speedway Control Board.
Cycling
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom is
the British Cycling Federation—an amalgamation of the British League of Racing
Cyclists and the National Cyclists’ Union, founded in 1878. The federation controls
track racing and massed start racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling
events in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship.
Time trials are organised by the Road Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling Federation
and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC is the oldest touring
club in the world and has a membership of 40,000. It has consuls in all parts of the
United Kingdom to give advice and practical help to touring cyclists; its fifty district
SPORT
511
associations arrange holiday and week-end tours, and competitions, rallies and rides
of all kinds; and its special travel department gives CTC members every facility, both
at home and abroad, from the provision of itineraries to the supplying of tickets, maps
and other essential requirements.
Rifle Shooting
Full-bore (-303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association,
founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting is held annually at Bisley Camp, Surrey, and
is open to subjects of the Queen, and to all-comers; the latter are restricted to certain
competitions. The meeting extends over 17 days; the first week consists of team and
individual competitions for members of the armed forces, and there are three days for
schools only. The premier award of the meeting is the Queen’s Prize, which attracts
about 1,250 entries.
Small-bore (-22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of 15 to 25
yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also widely practised in Britain.
Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to county rifle associations and
the National Small-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA), which arranges inter-club and
inter-county competitions of various kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA
also organises a National Bisley Meeting (usually attended by about 1,500 competitors),
a Scottish meeting, and a pistol shooting competition at Bisley. International small¬
bore rifle matches are fired against teams from overseas countries, and British teams
are entered for the world championships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.
