Introduction
Britain 1988 is the thirty-ninth official handbook in the series; it has
been prepared by the Central Office of Information on behalf of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The handbook is widely known as
an established work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference
facilities provided by British information services in many countries. It
is sold by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1988 describes many features in the life of the country,
including the workings of the Government and other major institu¬
tions. It does not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note whether
they refer to England, to England and Wales (considered together for
many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which
comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom
(which is the same as Britain, that is. Great Britain and Northern
Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in Britain 1988 is compiled with
the co-operation of other government departments and agencies, and of
many other organisations. Sources of more detailed and more topical
information (including statistics) are mentioned in the text and a guide
to official sources is given in Appendix 2.
The text, generally, is based on information available up to August
1987.

Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern
Ireland, and is one of the 12 member states of the European Community. Its full
name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Britain constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a geographical term for a
group of islands lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest
of the islands is Great Britain (the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland).
The next largest comprises Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south west are
the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by the
large archipelago known as the Hebrides and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are Orkney and Shetland. All these have administrative ties with the
mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between
Great Britain and France are largely self-governing, and are not part of the
United Kingdom.
With an area of some 244,100 sq km (94,250 sq miles), Britain is about the
same size as the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand or Uganda, and half
the size of France. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles) from the south
coast to the extreme north of Scotland and just under 500 km (some 300 miles)
across in the widest part. No place in Britain is as much as 120 km (75 miles)
from tidal water. The prime meridian of 0° passes through the old observatory at
Greenwich (London).
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow, usually less than 90 m (50
fathoms or 300 ft), because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the north
west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 180 m (some
600 ft) to 900 m (about 3,000 ft). The shallow waters are important because
they provide breeding grounds for fish. The warming effect on the air of the
North Atlantic current is magnified as its water spreads across the shelf.
The climate is generally mild and temperate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions moving eastwards across the Atlantic. It is subject to frequent
changes but to few extremes of temperature. It is rarely above 32°C (90°F) or
below — 10°C (14°F). Near sea-level in the west the mean annual temperature
ranges from 8°C (46°F) in the Hebrides to 11°C (52°F) in the extreme south west
of England: latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly
temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 3°C (37°F)
during the winter (December, January and February) to 11°C (52°F) during the
summer (June, July and August); the corresponding figures for the Isle of
Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (41°F) and 16°C (61°F). The average annual
rainfall is more than 1,600 mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas of the
west and north but less than 800 mm (30 inches) over central and eastern parts.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year, but, on average, March to
June are the driest months and September to January the wettest. The

distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south to north, a
decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During May, June
and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration of sunshine
varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight (November, December and January)
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of an hour a day in northern
Scotland and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
The word Britain derives from Greek and Latin names probably stemming from
a Celtic original, which is also reflected in the name of the region of
north-western France (‘Brittany’ in English) settled by migrants from Britain in
the fifth and sixth centuries ad. Although, in the prehistoric time-scale, the
Celts were relatively late arrivals in the British Isles (following cultures which
had produced such notable monuments as the stone circles of Avebury and
Stonehenge) it is only with them that Britain emerges into recorded history, and
the term Celtic is often used rather generally to distinguish the early inhabitants
of the British Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
Following sorties by Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 bc, Britain was occupied by
the Romans in the first century ad and an ordered civilisation was established
under their rule for two or three hundred years except in the territory north of
Hadrian’s Wall (the wall across northern England planned by Hadrian, Roman
Emperor from ad 117 to 138) and in some western areas. Christian missionaries
arrived not only in Roman Britain but also in Scotland and Ireland.
The final Roman withdrawal in the fifth century, however, followed a long period
of increasing disorder during which there began raids on the island from
northern Europe—mainly by peoples traditionally described as Angles (from
Schleswig), Saxons and Jutes. It is from the Angles that the name England
derives. In the following two centuries the raids turned into settlement and the
establishment of a number of small kingdoms (with the Britons, or Celts,
maintaining an independent existence in the areas now known as Wales and
Cornwall). Among these kingdoms, more powerful ones which claimed over¬
lordship over the whole country were established, first in the north (North¬
umbria), then in the central area (Mercia) and finally in the south (Wessex).
However, further raids and settlement by the Vikings from Scandinavia
occurred, although in the tenth century the Wessex dynasty defeated the
invading Danes and established a wide-ranging authority in England. A second
wave of Danish invasions, however, led to the establishment of a Danish dynasty
in England between 1017 and 1042, when the Wessex line was restored.
The last successful invasion of England took place following a disputed
succession when Duke William of Normandy (a duchy established by the Vikings
and owing only nominal allegiance to the French king) enforced his claims by
defeating the English at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. There was considerable
settlement by Normans and others from France, French became the language of
the nobility for the next three centuries and the legal and, to some extent, social
structure was influenced by that which prevailed across the Channel. The
monarchy established by William and his successors was, in general, more
effective than its predecessors and it began to establish its authority over
increasingly wide areas of the British Isles.
Wales had remained a Celtic stronghold, although often within the English
sphere of influence. Conflict was frequent within Wales between the various
princes and unity was achieved only temporarily. However, with the death in
battle in 1282 of Prince Llywelyn, Edward I launched a successful campaign to
bring Wales under English rule, with Wales being placed under the same laws as
England for the most part, and Edward’s heir being created Prince of Wales in

1301, a title which has subsequently been bestowed upon the eldest son of the
Sovereign. Continued strong Welsh national feeling was indicated by the rising
led by Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the fifteenth century, but a new
dimension to the situation was provided by the accession to the English throne
in 1485 of Henry VII of the Welsh House of Tudor. The Acts of Union of 1536 and
1542 united England and Wales administratively, politically and legally.
Hadrian’s Wall had proved no insurmountable barrier between the Romans and
their northern neighbours, and far-reaching expeditions both by the Romans
into Scotland and by the Scottish people known as Piets into England took
place. In the sixth century the Scots from Ireland or ‘Scotia’ settled in the area of
Scotland now known as Argyll. Lothian was English in population, and Welsh
Britons moved north from the invading English into Strathclyde. A united
kingdom emerged in the ninth century while Scotland, like England, was
endeavouring to defend itself against the Vikings. The establishment of a
powerful monarchy in England, however, especially after the Norman Conquest
in the eleventh century, was to pose an intermittent but considerable threat to
Scottish independence throughout the Middle Ages and well into the sixteenth
century.
The eventual unification of the crowns reflected the fact that, as a result of the
Reformation (a process which occupied most of the sixteenth century), old
national antagonisms had become less important than religious differences.
Following the death of the childless Elizabeth 1 in 1603, the Protestant James
Stuart, James VI of Scotland (son of Mary, Queen of Scots, whose grandmother
was a sister of Henry VIII), ascended the English throne as James I. England,
Wales and Scotland were henceforth known as Great Britain. Apart from the
union of the monarchies, however, England and Scotland remained separate
during the seventeenth century, except for an enforced unification by Oliver
Cromwell early in the period of the Commonwealth (1649—60) after he had
defeated royalist forces in Scotland. By the beginning of the following century
political and economic arguments for a closer union were apparent in both
countries. Eventually, in 1707, both sides agreed on the formation of a single
parliament for Great Britain although Scotland retained its own system of law
and church settlement. The Union was put under strain when Queen Anne died
in 1714 and George, Elector of Hanover (descended from a daughter of James I),
succeeded the Stuarts on the British throne. ‘Jacobite’ rebellions, aiming to
restore the Stuarts to the British throne, took place in 1715 and 1745 but were
unsuccessful.
In Ireland, out of a patchwork of Celtic and pre-Celtic peoples similar to that in
Britain, a number of kingdoms had emerged before the Christian era; any
supremacy established by one over the others in the following 1,000 years was of
a temporary nature. Ireland, however, did not escape the incursions of the
Vikings, who dominated the country during the tenth century.
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an invasion of Ireland, the overlordship
of which he had been granted by the Pope, who was anxious to bring the Irish
church into full obedience to Rome. Although a large part of the country came
under the control of Anglo-Norman magnates, little direct authority was
exercised from England during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
Henry VIH’s assumption of the title of King of Ireland in 1541 arose from his
desire to apply the Reformation settlement and thereafter the religious issue was
to produce far-reaching consequences. The determination to establish royal
authority in Ireland was strengthened during the reign of Elizabeth I by the fear
that the country might be used by Philip of Spain in his efforts to subjugate
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England, and a series of campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents. The
main focus of the resistance was the northern province of Ulster and, with its
collapse in 1607, Ulster became an area of settlement by immigrants from
Scotland and England. (There was settlement by immigrants elsewhere in
Ireland, though on a lesser scale.)
The English civil war of 1642 to 1652 led to further risings in Ireland which
were crushed by Cromwell. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 was
followed by the accession of the Roman Catholic James II to the throne in 1685,
and there was more fighting after his deposition three years later in favour of his
nephew and son-in-law, the Protestant William of Orange and his wife Mary.
During most of the eighteenth century there was an uneasy peace and towards
its end various efforts were made by British governments to achieve stability. In
1782 the Irish Parliament (dating from medieval times) was given legislative
independence; the only constitutional tie with Great Britain was the Crown. The
Parliament represented, however, only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, who
had obtained possession of most of the agricultural land, and Catholics were
excluded from it. Against the background of an abortive rebellion in 1798 and
the prospect of intervention by France (with which Great Britain was at war
between 1793 and 1815) the Irish Parliament was induced to vote for union with
what, from 1801, was to be the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland.
The ‘Irish question’ continued as one of the major problems of British politics
during the nineteenth century. In 1886 the Liberal Government introduced a
Home Rule Bill which would have given an Irish Parliament authority over most
internal matters while reserving to Britain control over external affairs. This led
to a split in the Liberal Party and the failure of the Bill. It was not until 1914 that
Home Rule was enacted by the Government of Ireland Act. Its implementation
was, however, prevented both by the threat of armed resistance on the part of
the Protestant majority in Ulster and by the outbreak of the first world war.
A nationalist uprising in Dublin in 1916 was suppressed, but with the end of
the first world war a guerrilla force known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
began operations against the British administration. In 1921 a settlement was
reached under which six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament, but remained represented in and subject to the supreme
authority of the British Parliament, while the remainder of Ireland as the Irish
Free State (later to become the Irish Republic) became a self-governing state
outside the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Channel Islands Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the United
and Isle of Man Kingdom, they have a special relationship with it because of the antiquity of
their connection with the Crown. The Channel Islands were integrated into the
Duchy of Normandy in the tenth and eleventh centuries and have been
dependent territories of the Crown since the Norman Conquest. The Isle of Man
was under the nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266 when it was ceded to
Scotland, subsequently passing to the Earls of Derby for a period but eventually
coming under the direct administration of the Crown in 1765. Today the
territories have their own legislative assemblies and systems of local administra¬
tion and of law, and their own courts. The British Government is responsible
for their defence, their international relations and, ultimately, their good
government.
The position of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in the European
Community is broadly that the islands remain outside the Community except
for customs purposes and for certain aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The residents benefit from Community provisions relating to the free movement
of people or services only if they have close ties with Britain.
LAND AND PEOPLE

ENGLAND
The Four Lands
In the following pages there are brief descriptions of a number of aspects of
social, economic and political life for each of the four countries, England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some additional material on the political
situation in Northern Ireland. (Statistics on the four lands are contained in
Table 1.)
England is predominantly a lowland country. There are upland regions in the
north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the south west in Devon and Cornwall. For the most part,
however, the country is undulating or flat and, in the south, crossed by low
ranges of hills including the Cotswolds and the Kent and Sussex Downs. The
greatest concentrations of population are in the London and Thames estuary
areas, the West Yorkshire and north-west industrial cities, the midlands
conurbation around Birmingham, the north-east conurbations on the rivers
Tyne and Tees, and along the Channel coast.
The Church of England, which was separated from the Roman Catholic
Church at the Reformation, is the Established Church in England; the
Sovereign must always be a member of the Church and appoints its two
archbishops and 42 other diocesan bishops.

The English language is descended from the German tongue spoken by the
Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries, subsequently being influenced by
Latin and Norse vocabulary, and then transformed with the settlement by the
Normans from France. English is spoken throughout Britain and in many other
countries. A recent study suggests that it is used as an official language in over
60 countries, more than any other international language.
England has no government minister or department exclusively responsible for
its central administration of domestic affairs, in contrast to Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. Instead, responsibility is shared among a number of
government departments, whose responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland. There are 523 Members of Parliament
for England in the House of Commons, and arrangements are made for the
discussion of regional affairs. Of the two major political parties, the Conserva¬
tives find their support chiefly in suburban and rural areas and have a large
majority of the parliamentary seats in the southern half of England and in East
Anglia, while the Labour Party derives its main support from urban industrial¬
ised areas. In the 1987 election England returned 357 Conservative Members of
Parliament, 155 Labour, 7 Liberal, 3 Social Democrat and the Speaker of the
House of Commons.
Local government is administered through a two-tier system of counties
subdivided into districts, except in London, where local government is the
responsibility of 32 borough councils and the Corporation of the City of London.
A major reorganisation of local government was implemented in 1986 when the
Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils of Greater
Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and
West Yorkshire were abolished and most of their functions transferred to
London borough and metropolitan district councils.
Eight ‘standard’ regions in England are delimited principally for statistical
purposes: South East, East Anglia, South West, West Midlands, East Midlands,
Yorkshire and Humberside, North West and North. They play no part in local
government and frequently do not coincide with the regional units adopted by
central government departments.
The legal system of England comprises on the one hand a historic body of
conventions, known as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and on the other, parliamen¬
tary and European Community legislation. Common law stems from the work of
the king’s judges after the Norman Conquest of 1066 who sought to bring
together into a single body of legal principles the various local customs of the
Anglo-Saxons. Great reliance was placed on precedent, and the practice of
reporting on cases began in the thirteenth century. Equity law derives from the
practice of petitioning the king’s Chancellor in cases not covered by common
law. The English legal system is therefore distinct from many of those of Western
Europe which have codes deriving from Roman law. The Habeas Corpus Act
1679 is a fundamental statute forbidding imprisonment without trial.
Up to the eighteenth century the English economy was mainly agrarian and the
chief manufacture was wool cloth. London as the capital city, and a major port
and mercantile centre, and the textile areas (East Anglia, south-western
England and West Yorkshire) were the most populous and prosperous regions.
In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, rapid growth took
place in the midlands, the north west, west Yorkshire and the north east, where
the coalfields and iron ore deposits permitted Britain to become the first
industrialised nation, basing its wealth on coalmining, on the manufacture of
iron and steel, heavy machinery and textiles, on shipbuilding and on trade.
London enhanced its position with the growing strength of the economy but

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
East Anglia and the West Country, remote from areas of industrial development,
were affected by agricultural depression, and entered a period of relative decline.
In the twentieth century, the second period of industrialisation, based on new
sources of energy, new manufacturing industries and new forms of transport,
has continued to change the broad pattern of regional and industrial develop¬
ment in England. In the 1920s and 1930s the northern industrial centres saw
their traditional industries weakened owing to fluctuations in world trade and
competition from other industrialising countries and, in some cases, from
substitute products. London, its surrounding counties and the West Midlands
generally benefited from the newer, more mobile, industries. These included
chemicals (such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, plastics and artificial fibres),
electrical and electronic engineering, vehicle manufacture, aircraft building,
instrument engineering, aluminium and rubber manufacture and a wide range
of consumer goods, including processed food, drink and tobacco products as
well as durables.
In the second half of the century economic trends and population growth have
tended to favour smaller towns and rural areas, particularly those in parts of
southern England and East Anglia. A number of industrial areas (in the North,
the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands) have
suffered over the last decade as a result of the decline in manufacturing
employment. Through its regional industrial policy the Government aims to
reduce regional disparities in employment opportunities by making investment
incentives available in the areas of greatest need, especially those which have
been dependent on declining industries. Significant steps are also being taken
to revive economic activity in inner urban areas.
East Anglia has been the fastest-growing English region in both population
and employment since the 1960s. Although largely agricultural, in recent years
high-technology industry has developed throughout the region. One significant
example is the Cambridge Science Park containing a number of science-based
companies and research organisations with close collaborative links with the
University. Food processing, diesel engines, electronics and instrument en¬
gineering are the strongest industries. Other particular growth points have been
Peterborough and the east coast ports, which benefit from their relative
proximity to the northern European Community countries. The service sector
has been growing in Cambridge, Ipswich and Norwich.
Greater London and the industrial cities of the West Midlands, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside and the North continue to represent the largest
concentrations of manufacturing industry. London is an important area for
products of all kinds including food and drink (especially brewing), instrument
engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, clothing, furniture and
printing. Of importance in the surrounding south-eastern counties are oil
refining (along the Thames and near Southampton), pharmaceuticals, pumps,
valves and compressors, instrument engineering, electronics (particularly in
Berkshire and Hertfordshire, and around Chelmsford), motor vehicles, aero¬
space, building materials, timber, paper and plastics products. There is
diversity, too, in the North West, with significant activity in food processing
(especially grain milling, bread, flour confectionery and biscuits), chemicals,
textile machinery, insulated wires and cables, computers (Manchester being one
of the largest centres in the country), motor vehicles, aerospace, clothing, glass
making (with the world's largest flat glass maker, Pilkington, in St Helens),
paper and rubber products. Lancashire is the centre of the cotton and allied
textile industries.
The characteristic manufactures of the West Midlands are metals (steel tubes,
iron castings and non-ferrous metals), machine tools, electrical engineering,
motor vehicles, carpets, pottery (with about 70 per cent of Britain’s ceramics
LAND AND PEOPLE

industry located in Staffordshire) and rubber production. Of the other regions,
Yorkshire and Humberside has important shares of cocoa, chocolate and
confectionery production, iron and steel, machine tools, textile machinery,
woollen and worsted goods (producing about two-thirds of Britain's wool
textiles), carpets, clothing and glass containers. The North has general
chemicals, iron and steel, process plant, marine engineering, and clothing; the
East Midlands has steel tubes, iron castings, about two-thirds of Britain’s
hosiery and knitted goods industry, and footwear; and the South West has food
and drink processing, aerospace, a range of engineering industries and paper
products.
In agriculture, the number of mixed holdings has been falling, as part of a
general tendency towards greater specialisation. Dairying is most common in
the west of England, where the wetter climate encourages the growth of good
grass; sheep and cattle are reared in the hilly and moorland areas of northern
and south-western England; and arable farming, pig and poultry farming and
horticulture are concentrated in the east and south. Horticulture is also
important in the West Midlands. Forestry is mainly found in the North, South
East and South West regions. The principal fishing ports are on the east coast
and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in its coalfields and has access to
offshore oil and gas reserves. About 65 per cent of Britain’s deep-mined coal is
produced in the Midlands and Yorkshire coalfields, the latter being the most
productive in the country. The electricity grid of England and Wales is one of the
largest interconnected power networks under unified control in the Western
world. The world’s first large-scale nuclear power station was established at
Calder Hall in Cumbria in 1956, while substantial investment in reprocessing
capacity is being undertaken nearby. Other nuclear power stations are on
coastal sites, including eight around the coasts of southern England. Important
mineral deposits in England include aggregates for the construction industry
(sand, gravel and crushed rock), industrial minerals (including clay, salt from
the North West and china clay from Cornwall), tin ore, also from Cornwall, and
iron ore from the East Midlands and Humberside. Water resources include the
Kielder Reservoir (Northumberland), one of Europe’s largest man-made lakes.
A motorway network has been constructed in England since the 1950s and
comprises four long-distance arterial routes linking London and the cities of the
midlands, the North and North West and the South West, the London orbital
route (completed in 1986), and over 30 shorter motorways. Inter-city travel has
been improved by the introduction of high-speed rail services which are among
the best in the world in speed, frequency and comfort. Many ports have been
equipped to deal with new developments in shipping (such as container ships)
and to take account of changes in the nature of trade brought about by the
increase in oil traffic through North Sea ports and the growing proportion of
trade with the continent of Europe. In 1986 the British and French governments
jointly announced their decision to facilitate the construction of a fixed link
across the Channel in the form of twin single-track rail tunnels to carry through
rail services, linking Britain directly with the European rail system, and a
drive-on, drive-off vehicle shuttle service using specially designed shuttle trains.
Construction is expected to begin later in 1987 and the tunnel could be in
operation in 1993. The major airports are Heathrow (the busiest international
airport in the world) and Gatwick, both serving London, and Manchester, Luton
and Birmingham. Construction has begun of a new passenger terminal in
connection with the first phase of the development of Stansted as London’s third
airport.
Employment in service industries has accounted for an increasing share of
total employment in recent years, expansion being particularly marked in
10
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
financial and business services. London is one of the world’s leading centres of
banking, insurance and other financial services. Decentralisation of some office
services from the capital has led to a growth of office employment in
surrounding regions such as East Anglia. London and the neighbouring
counties also account for much of advertising and market research activity, half
of central government services and a significant proportion of non-food
wholesale distribution in England. After London and the South East (where
nearly 75 per cent of employees are engaged in the service sector), the South
West has the next most important concentration of service industries. Tourism,
catering and the leisure industries have also expanded. Over half of expenditure
by overseas visitors in Britain takes place in London, although areas outside
London are becoming increasingly popular with overseas tourists, while the
South West is the most popular region for domestic tourism. Each region has its
own particular attraction for tourists. For example, a number of areas including
Northumberland and Cumbria (whose peaks include Scafell, England's highest
point, at 978 m, 3,210 ft) have hills and lakes which attract walkers, climbers
and riders.
Cultural and
Social Life
WALES
Cultural life in England takes so many forms that a brief summary can only
attempt to suggest its variety. London alone has over 100 theatres, including
some 50 in the West End , together with fringe and suburban theatres, about a
dozen major centres for music concerts, ballet and opera, four major art
galleries, a dozen major museums (with over 80 smaller galleries and museums),
and over 140 West End, local and independent cinemas, and other leisure
facilities include discotheques, bingo halls, amusement arcades, ice and roller
skating rinks, and sports or leisure centres. With its ceremonial occasions,
palaces, other historic buildings and shops, London is also one of the world’s
leading tourist centres. About 15 attractions (Westminster Abbey, the Tower of
London, St Paul s Cathedral, Madame Tussaud’s—an exhibition of waxworks of
famous people the London Zoo, Kew Gardens and the major museums and art
galleries) each receive more than a million visitors a year.
Because of its size and its position as the capital city, London is not
representative of the rest of England, but much the same broad range of cultural
interests is reflected in many other cities and towns. The English Tourist Board
lists some 1,230 art galleries, museums and similar institutions in the rest of
England. Social clubs and working men's clubs, non-profit-making clubs which
attract well-known entertainers, are found in most cities and towns. In addition,
many rural or outdoor recreations are strongly supported and there is active
interest in numerous games and sports, many of which were devised in Britain.
The English love of gardens and landscapes is associated with a tradition of
sightseeing visits to the many country houses, gardens and unspoilt rural and
coastal areas. There are seven national parks, two forest parks, 32 designated
areas of outstanding natural beauty , 11 environmentally sensitive areas, about
150 country parks approved by the Countryside Commission, 550 ‘outstanding
conservation areas’, 676 km (420 miles) of designated heritage coastline and
2,075 historic buildings and gardens listed by the English Tourist Board. Newer
developments include the opening of safari and wildlife parks and of ‘theme’
parks devoted, for example, to maritime history, which offer a diversity of
entertainments as well. Many regions and towns have associations with the
great English writers and artists, such as William Shakespeare, William
Wordsworth, Arnold Bennett, Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters, Thomas
Hardy, Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable.
Wales is a country of hills and mountains with extensive tracts of high plateau
and shorter stretches of mountain ranges deeply dissected by river valleys. The

highest mountains are in Snowdonia in the north west; the highest peak is
Snowdon (1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The lower-lying ground is largely confined to the
relatively narrow coastal belt and the lower parts of the river valleys. The main
areas of settlement are in the southern valleys and coastal areas, where
two-thirds of the population live. The chief urban centres are Cardiff, Swansea,
Newport and Wrexham. Wales is a principality; Prince Charles, the heir to the
throne, was invested by the Queen with the title of Prince of Wales at Caernarfon
Castle in 1969 when he was 20.
The country has its own Welsh language, spoken (according to the 1981
census) by 19 per cent of the population, chiefly in the rural north and west. The
Welsh name of the country is Cymru. Measures adopted since the 1960s have
helped to revive the use of the language, which is of Celtic origin and closely
resembles Breton, spoken in Brittany in France. They include recognising the
equal validity of Welsh with English in law courts, the encouragement of
bilingual education in schools, and the extended use of Welsh for official
purposes and in broadcasting. Welsh-language television programmes are
transmitted in Wales by Sianel 4 Cymru (Channel 4 Wales).
There is no established church in Wales, the Anglican church having been
disestablished in 1920 following decades of pressure from adherents of the more
evangelical Methodist and Baptist persuasions. Methodism in particular had
spread rapidly in Wales in the eighteenth century, assuming the nature of a
popular movement among Welsh speakers and finding strong support later in
industrial communities.
The country returns 38 Members of Parliament and there are special arrange¬
ments for the discussion of Welsh affairs. For the last 60 years the industrial
communities of Wales have tended to support the Labour Party in elections,
ensuring a Labour majority in Wales. In the 1987 election 24 Labour, 8
Conservative, 3 Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and 3 Liberal members were
returned. Substantial administrative autonomy is centred on the Secretary of
State for Wales, who is a member of the Cabinet, and has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy, welfare services and the provision of
amenities. The headquarters of the administration is the Welsh Office in
Cardiff, which also has an office in London. In 1979 proposals for the
establishment of an elected Welsh assembly in Cardiff to take over policymaking
and executive powers from central government were rejected in a referendum
held in Wales. Local government is exercised through a system of elected
authorities similar to that in England, and the legal system is identical with the
English one.
The south Wales coalfield was developed during the latter part of the industrial
revolution in the middle of the nineteenth century, creating populous urban
centres which drew labour from the rural areas and from England and Ireland.
However, the economy was narrowly based, mainly on coal, iron, steel and
tinplate, and contracted sharply during the 1920s and 1930s, resulting in
severe employment problems and substantial emigration.
Notable features of the past three decades have been the continuing
contraction of coalmining and iron and steel production (although Wales still
accounts for about one-third of Britain’s steel production), the advent of a more
diverse range of manufacturing industries and the growth of service industries.
Wales is developing as an important centre for electronics in Britain and several
new high-technology businesses in electronics and related industries have been
established. Inward investment by overseas companies (especially Japanese and
United States high-technology concerns) has been considerable, and there are
over 200 overseas-owned or associated firms in Wales, employing about 45,000
12
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
people and accounting for around one in five jobs in the manufacturing sector.
South Wales remains the principal industrial area but new industries and firms
have also been introduced on the smaller coalfield in north-east Wales, around
Wrexham and Deeside, again to offset the decline in the older, basic industries
which previously dominated the area. Light industry has also been attracted to
the towns in the rural areas in mid- and north Wales and an important refinery
complex has developed around Milford Haven, one of Britain’s major oil ports. A
development corporation was set up in April 1987 to stimulate the regeneration
of the Cardiff Bay area.
Agriculture occupies about 80 per cent of the land area, the main activities
being sheep and cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy farming in the
lowlands. Wales accounts for about 11 per cent of forest area in Britain and over
20 per cent of Forestry Commission timber production.
Wales produces about 8 per cent of Britain’s deep-mined coal and 12 per cent
of opencast production, including all of its anthracite. The biggest pumped-
storage power station in Europe is at Dinorwig, while there are nuclear power
stations at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd. Wales exports about half of its water supply
to England.
Good communications exist in the south with motorway links across the
Severn Bridge to southern England and the midlands, and high-speed rail
services to a number of destinations in England. The main road along the north
Wales coast is being upgraded and a second crossing of the Severn is planned.
There has been expansion in financial and business services, in the tourist
and catering trades and in some areas of public administration. With its coastal
resorts (which include Tenby, Saundersfoot, Rhyl, Llandudno, Colwyn Bay,
Porthcawl and Barry), and the attractions of three national parks (Snowdonia!
the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire Coast), as well as other areas of
picturesque hill, lake and mountain country, Wales attracts many tourists,
especially for outdoor holidays.
Cultural and
Social Life
There is much literary, musical and dramatic activity in Wales and there is a
National Library and National Museum. Welsh literature is one of the oldest in
Europe. The country is well known for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation. The special festivals of Wales, known as
eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh literature and music. The largest is the Royal
National Eisteddfod of Wales, held annually, entirely in Welsh, and consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and poetry. The town of Llangollen has
extended its eisteddfod to include artists from all over the world in the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. Famous modern Welsh artists have included
the opera singers Sir Geraint Evans and Dame Gwyneth Jones and the poet
Dylan Thomas. An active local press .includes a number of Welsh language
publications. Great interest is aroused by the annual rugby football competition
in which sides from Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and France take part.
Health services are provided mainly under the National Health Service,
administered by the Welsh Office, while personal social services and education
(except at university level) are provided mainly through the local authorities.
Educational provision is similar to that in England except for the use of Welsh in
some schools, particularly in the Welsh-speaking, largely rural, areas. The
collegiate University of Wales, founded in 1893, comprises six member
institutions.
Scotland may be divided broadly into three areas: the sparsely populated
highlands and islands in the north, accounting for just over half the total area of
the country: the central lowlands, containing three-quarters of the population
and most of the industrial centres and cultivated farmland: and the Southern
SCOTLAND

The Economy
Uplands, containing a number of hill ranges, which border on England. The
highest mountains are the Grampians in the central highlands, with Ben Nevis
(1,343 m, 4,406 ft) the highest peak. The chief cities are the capital Edinburgh,
the main industrial centre Glasgow, and the two regional centres Aberdeen and
Dundee.
The period from 1750 onwards has seen considerable and continuous
emigration of Scots to England and overseas. However, the rate slowed markedly
in the 1970s as the offshore oil and gas industries developed and there was
inward migration to the north east of Scotland, although the large outflow of
people from Strathclyde has continued, but at a lower level. In the mid¬
nineteenth century, as Scotland industrialised rapidly, there was large-scale
immigration from Ireland.
The period from 1750 until the beginning of the twentieth century was also
one of stability and economic progress and of achievements in many fields.
Among the famous men to emerge were David Hume, Robert Burns, Sir Walter
Scott, Adam Smith, Robert Adam, James Watt, John MacAdam, Lord Kelvin,
Alexander Graham Bell and James Clerk Maxwell.
The Church of Scotland, which became the established church in 1690, has
complete freedom in all matters of doctrine, order and discipline. It is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in form, being governed by a hierarchy
of church courts, each of which includes lay people.
There are special arrangements for the conduct of Scottish affairs within the
British system of government and separate Acts of Parliament are passed for
Scotland where appropriate. In the 1987 general election the 72 Scottish seats
in the House of Commons were apportioned as follows: 50 Labour, 10
Conservative, 7 Liberal, 3 Scottish National and 2 Social Democrat. Since 1959
Scotland, like Wales, has had a majority of Labour Members of Parliament.
Administrative tasks relating to a wide range of economic and social functions
are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, a member of the
Cabinet, working through the Scottish Office, with its administrative head¬
quarters in Edinburgh and an office in London. A proposal for an elected
assembly for Scotland, on which a referendum was held in 1979, failed to gain
the support of the required 40 per cent of the electorate, even though a majority
of those voting gave it their approval.
Local government generally operates on a two-tier basis broadly similar to that
in England and Wales but established by separate legislation. The three islands
councils (for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles) are single-tier authorities.
The principles and procedures of the Scottish legal system (particularly in civil
law) differ in many respects from those of England and Wales, stemming, in
part, from the adoption of elements of other European legal systems, based on
Roman law, during the sixteenth century.
Scotland has experienced the same pressure on its traditional industries as the
north of England and Wales. The regional policies of successive governments
and investment by overseas companies have both made significant contribu¬
tions to the growth of modern, technologically based industries, and Scotland's
economic structure is now broadly similar to that of Britain as a whole.
Engineering remains a major industry, accounting for over a quarter of the
manufacturing workforce, but there has been a significant trend towards lighter
engineering products and rapid expansion in electronics (including micro¬
electronics). By mid-1986 over 250 plants were employing some 43,000 workers,
one of the biggest concentrations of the electronics industry in Western Europe.
Scotland accounts for over 50 per cent of Britain's output of integrated circuits
and for 15 per cent of European output.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cultural and
Social Life
Since the early 1970s the Scottish economy has also benefited from the
growth of offshore-related industries following the discovery of oil and gas under
the northern North Sea, although the industries have been adversely affected by
the recent decline in world oil prices. In the 1980s up to about 100,000jobs have
arisen directly or indirectly as a result of North Sea activities. Many of these jobs
reflect overseas investment solely related to the exploration and development of
North Sea resources, but oil and gas developments have stimulated other
industries including engineering and petrochemicals; a major new ethylene
plant at Mossmorran (Fife) came onstream in 1985, reinforcing Scotland's
position in the chemicals industry. Traditional industries, such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding, have experienced a long-term decline in employment, but are
still important contributors to the Scottish economy. Other traditional manu¬
factures, such as high-quality tweeds and other textiles, and food and drink
products, remain important. There are about 90 whisky distilleries in Scotland
and the industry is a major export earner.
Northern and north-east Scotland (particularly Aberdeen) have benefited most
from offshore developments. However, Strathclyde, by far the most populous
region, has experienced serious industrial decline and population loss, particu¬
larly in Glasgow. In the remainder of the central belt and in the five new towns
(East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Livingston, Irvine and Cumbernauld) trends have
been generally more favourable. In Lothian the large concentration of financial
and other service industries centred on Edinburgh has been a helpful influence.
Scotland has about one-third of Britain’s total agricultural land, but 68 per
cent of it consists of hill grazing for cattle and sheep. About 13 per cent of the
agricultural area is used for crops, and 63 per cent of this is under barley.
Scotland accounts for nearly half of Britain's forest area and for 40 per cent of
public sector timber production; the bulk of new planting in Britain takes place
in Scotland, most of it in the upland and mountain areas. Fishing remains an
important activity; more than 65 per cent of total landings of fish in Britain are
made by vessels based in Scotland.
Despite the advent of cheaper natural gas, Scotland still depends heavily on
electricity; nuclear and hydro-electric generation supply a higher proportion of
energy than in any other part of Britain. Large supplies of unpolluted water form
a major resource.
Communications, both domestic and international, have improved in many
areas, particularly in the north and north east, owing to the stimulus of the
offshore oil industry and to road- and bridge-building programmes. The offshore
oil industry has also encouraged expansion in financial and business services
which have been traditionally strong in Scotland.
Tourism, which makes a significant contribution to the economy and to
employment in Scotland as a whole, is estimated to generate, both directly and
indirectly, nearly 100,000jobs. Scotland s cultural and historic associations, its
varied scenic beauty, and the opportunities for sport and recreation are
particular attractions. Golf originated in Scotland, and courses at St Andrews,
Gleneagles, Turnberry and Prestwick are internationally renowned. Skiing is
growing in importance, with centres at Aviemore, Glenshee, Glencoe and the
Lecht, and further developments are planned.
A vigorous cultural life in Scotland has as its highlight the annual Edinburgh
International Festival, one of the world’s leading cultural events. Notable
performing arts bodies are the Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Opera,
Scottish Ballet, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Baroque Ensemble and
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Scotland possesses excellent collections
of the fine and applied arts, notably in the National Galleries of Scotland, the
Royal Museums of Scotland and the City of Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries

(including the Burrell collection, opened in 1983). Glasgow has been designated
as European City of Culture for 1990.
A language of ancient Celtic origin, Scots Gaelic is spoken by some 80,000
people mainly in the islands and north west of Scotland. It is the indigenous
language, with its own literary background. Scottish people in the lowlands have
for centuries spoken Scots (or Lallans), a derivative of the Northumbrian dialect
of Old English, which has its own recognised literary tradition and has seen a
revival in poetry in recent times.
An active press includes six national daily morning newspapers, six local
evening newspapers and three national Sunday newspapers. There are also
some 110 local weekly newspapers published in Scotland. Articles in some
papers are printed in Gaelic. Television programmes are produced by BBC
(Scotland) and by three independent companies, covering the highland, lowland
and border regions. BBC Radio Scotland covers most of the population and there
are five ‘community’ services in the highlands and islands, two of them mainly
in Gaelic, and two in the borders, together with a number of independent radio
stations.
Local authorities are responsible for the provision of most education, except at
university level. Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised
on comprehensive lines: colleges of further education are administered by
education authorities while independent bodies administer higher education
institutions and colleges of education. There are eight universities, of which
four (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) were established in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while the other four have been established
since 1964. The educational tradition has been particularly strong in Scotland,
helping many Scots to positions of eminence in the arts and sciences.
Over 50 per cent of Scotland’s housing has been built since 1945, only
Northern Ireland having a larger percentage. Scotland has a high proportion of
housing rented from public authorities (almost 50 per cent compared with a
national average of less than 30 per cent), although in recent years there has
been a noticeable growth in owner-occupied housing as in the rest of Britain.
Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It
has a 488-km (303-mile) border in the south and west with the Irish Republic. At
its centre lies Lough Neagh, Britain’s largest freshwater lake (381 sq km,
147 sq miles). Many of the principal towns lie in valleys leading from the Lough,
including the capital, Belfast, which stands at the mouth of the river Lagan. The
Mourne Mountains, rising sharply in the south east, include Slieve Donard,
Northern Ireland’s highest peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Just under two-thirds of Northern Ireland’s population are descendants of
Scots or English settlers who crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly in the
seventeenth century: most belong to the Protestant faith, and have a traditional
loyalty to the maintenance of the union with Great Britain. The remainder, over
a third, are Irish in origin and mainly Roman Catholic: many of them are
nationalist in political opinion, favouring union with the Irish Republic.
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, but for 50 years from 1921 it
had its own devolved Parliament in which the mainly Protestant Unionists
consistently formed the majority and therefore constituted the Government after
successive elections. Nationalists, who are predominantly Roman Catholic,
resented this domination and their effective exclusion from political office.
Although substantial advances for the whole population were achieved in social
welfare and economic development, during the late 1960s an active and
articulate civil rights movement emerged. Reforms were made but sectarian
disturbances developed, which required the introduction of the Army in 1969 to

support the police in keeping the peace. Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from both sides, but most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army who claimed to be protecting the Roman
Catholic minority.
Despite the Northern Ireland Government’s substantial reform programme, the
inter-communal violence continued and the United Kingdom Government
concluded that the best hope of ending terrorism and achieving political
progress would be for the United Kingdom Parliament and Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland
Government felt unable to accept this and resigned, and in 1972 direct rule
began, with a United Kingdom Cabinet minister responsible for the functions
previously exercised by the Northern Ireland Government.
Several attempts have been made to secure a stable and effective devolved
government supported by both sides of the community. A new constitution
which devolved powers to an elected legislative assembly, and a ‘power-sharing’
executive representing all sections of the community, encountered Protestant
‘loyalist’ opposition culminating in a general strike in 1974; in 1976 an elected
constitutional convention failed to agree on a system of government that would
command widespread acceptance; in 1978 a planned framework for a form of
devolution to consolidate common ground among the political parties was
rejected; and in 1980 there was a political conference and extensive discussions.
In 1981 the appointment of a Northern Ireland Council to advise the Secretary of
State was proposed but rejected by the political parties in Northern Ireland.
In October 1982 elections took place to a new 78-member Assembly. The
Assembly was given responsibility for making proposals for devolving powers
on a basis which would command widespread acceptance throughout the com¬
munity. In the mean time, it performed scrutinising and consultative functions,
commenting upon draft legislation and initiating reports on such matters as
industry and education. Some members refused to take their seats on election.
The unionist parties, who had a majority in the Assembly, decided not to fulfil
the Assembly’s statutory functions in March 1986 in protest at the Anglo-Irish
Agreement (see below), and in June the Government decided that the Assembly
should be dissolved but at the same time expressed the hope that a future
Assembly would play a responsible part in Northern Ireland.
The Government’s policy continues to be based on two fundamental prin¬
ciples. First, that there will be no change in Northern Ireland’s constitutional
status as part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a majority of people
in Northern Ireland. This is in accordance with internationally accepted
principles of democracy; it is also reflected in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. A
‘border poll' in 1973 showed that a clear majority wished Northern Ireland to
remain part of the United Kingdom, and in subsequent elections parties which
support that position have continued to receive the majority of votes. Secondly,
the Government continues to believe that a devolved form of administration
would best meet Northern Ireland’s needs; but it will establish new structures of
devolved government only if they are acceptable to both parts of the community.
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to the United Kingdom Parliament. In
the last general election in 1987 the seats were distributed as follows: Ulster
Unionist 9, Democratic Unionist 3, Ulster Popular Unionist 1, Social Democratic
and Labour 3, and Sinn Fein 1 (although the last-mentioned member has not
taken his seat).
In November 1985, the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic concluded an
Agreement aimed at promoting peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The
Agreement has three main features. First, it affirms that no change in the status
LAND AND PEOPLE
17
Human Rights
and Security
Policy
The Economy
of Northern Ireland would come about except by the consent of a majority of its
people—which is recognised not to exist at present; but that if at some time a
majority formally consented to a united Ireland, both parties would support
legislation to that effect. Secondly, it establishes an Intergovernmental Confer¬
ence, through which the Irish Government can put forward views and proposals
on specified matters affecting Northern Ireland affairs (so far as they are not the
responsibility of a devolved administration). Matters discussed include avoid¬
ance of discrimination; relations between the security forces and the minority
community; the administration of justice; economic and social matters; human
rights; electoral arrangements; and the use of flags and emblems and of the Irish
language. Thirdly, the Conference is a forum for promoting cross-border
co-operation, in particular on security. The Conference has no executive role or
decision-making powers, and the Agreement makes clear that there is no
derogation from the sovereignty of either the United Kingdom Government or
the Irish Government; each retains full responsibility for the decisions about
administration of government within its own jurisdiction.
The Government is committed to the protection of human rights in Northern
Ireland. The United Kingdom is a signatory to the European Convention on
Human Rights and allows the right of individual petition. Legislation passed in
1973 outlaws discrimination by public bodies, including the Government, on
the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. Discrimination in employ¬
ment by both public and private employers is also illegal and the Fair
Employment Agency has been established to investigate complaints and enforce
fair practices. The independent Standing Advisory Commission on Human
Rights advises the Government on the effectiveness of these measures and on
other human rights issues.
While terrorism continues, certain emergency powers are in force. Under
legislation first introduced in 1973, these include special powers of arrest in
respect of certain serious crimes; non-jury courts to try those offences; and the
proscription of organisations involved in terrorism. There has been much
concern to reconcile these powers as far as possible with respect for individual
liberties: the measures are temporary, need annual renewal by Parliament and
have been subject to independent review. Following the most recent review,
completed in 1984, a number of amendments to the legislation have been made
by Parliament. Most traditional rights, including freedom from persecution,
freedom of speech and the right to prosecute the security forces if they exceed
their authority, remain in force. There is also an independent police complaints
board. Northern Ireland’s legal system, and the safeguards it enshrines, is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales.
The use of violence as a means of overcoming political differences has been
condemned by the overwhelming majority of people living in Northern Ireland
and, although terrorism continues, the overall level of violence is much lower
than in the early 1970s. The police take the primary role in maintaining order;
the Army's task is one of assisting the civil authorities, and the number of
soldiers on service has been considerably reduced. Security policy rests on the
principle of fair and effective enforcement of the law by bringing terrorists to
justice through the courts. They are tried for criminal offences and not for
political beliefs. At the heart of the policy is a determination to develop the
effectiveness of the police to the point where military involvement in the
maintenance of law and order is no longer needed.
The geography of Northern Ireland has played an important part in shaping its
economic development. A situation on the western edge of Europe, with few
indigenous mineral resources and only a small local market, has tended to
18
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
favour the concentration of industry and population on the eastern seaboard
close to trading links with the rest of the United Kingdom. Most of Northern
Ireland’s trade is with, or through. Great Britain. With certain exceptions, the
parts of the region beyond the immediate influence of the industrialised area
around Belfast have stayed predominantly rural, with generally small and often
scattered communities relying mainly on farming.
Since the end of the second world war two dominant trends have been
apparent in the economy. First, employment in the traditionally important
industries (shipbuilding, linen and agriculture) has declined. Secondly, there
has been growth in the numbers seeking work, reflecting the relatively high rate
of natural increase of the population, which is only partly offset by migration. In
effort to counterbalance these factors and to promote growth, programmes
within the broad framework of United Kingdom regional policy have been
carried out to develop infrastructure and attract investment from within the
country and from abroad. Despite the impact of the world-wide recession in the
1970s and continuing high rates of unemployment, there have been encourag¬
ing developments in the economy and, as part of the Government’s industrial
development policy, the promotion of small firms to create new jobs in
manufacturing, crafts and services is meeting with success. The discovery of
large deposits of lignite around Lough Neagh, which offer the prospect of
cheaper electricity in the longer term, should also benefit industry.
Belfast has Britain’s largest shipyard, and aerospace engineering is now one of
Northern Ireland’s biggest manufacturing industries. Other well-established
industrial activities include the manufacture of textile machinery and a wide
range of engineering products, tobacco and clothing. There has also been
extensive development in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronics,
telecommunications equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber. The linen
industry is enjoying a revival (farms are experimenting with growing flax) and
food processing and packaging is seen as a source of new employment.
Agriculture (predominantly livestock and products) is still an important
industry, accounting for almost a tenth of civil employment (including the
self-employed), over three times the proportion in Britain as a whole.
To meet the special problem of unemployment rates that are persistently
higher than in any of the other standard regions of Britain, successive
governments have offered more generous incentives than are available in the
rest of the country to encourage new investment both from within Britain and
from overseas, and assistance to mitigate high energy costs. The establishment
of enterprise zones’ in Belfast and Londonderry and the designation of
Aldergrove airport as a ‘freeport’ serve as additional incentives to investment.
Northern Ireland’s productivity and industrial relations records compare
favourably with those in the country as a whole. Altogether around 400
manufacturing projects which have been assisted are still in production,
including some 100 from outside Northern Ireland.
The modern diversification of the economy has helped to stimulate output,
productivity and incomes, and has assisted in narrowing the gap between living
standards in Northern Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Gross domestic product per person, which tends to be depressed in Northern
Ireland relative to the country as a whole, has nonetheless risen from just under
two-thirds of the British average in 1963 to almost three-quarters. Average
earnings are more than nine-tenths of the national average.
The principle underlying Northern Ireland’s financial relations with the rest of
the country is that it has parity, both of taxation and services, with England,
Scotland and Wales. To maintain social services at the level of those in Great
Britain, to meet the cost of security measures, and to compensate for the natural
disadvantages of geography and lack of resources, the United Kingdom

Cultural and
Social Life
Government’s subvention to Northern Ireland in 1986—87 was nearly £1,700
million.
In day-to-day social life Northern Ireland is in many ways similar to the rest of
the United Kingdom. For thousands of visitors (823,500 in 1986), as well as for
local people. Northern Ireland’s landscape and natural features, its cultural
traditions and festivals continue to offer special attractions. For many North
Americans the land from which their forebears emigrated (a number of United
States presidents have been descended from Northern Ireland families) has a
unique interest. The story of this contribution to American life, the history of
Northern Ireland, and aspects of its culture—from the dialects and strong
literary tradition (poets like Louis MacNeice and Seamus Heaney have inter¬
national reputations) to the songs and dances and folk art—are recorded in the
Ulster-American Folk Park, the Ulster Museum and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland is a major contributor to cultural life,
which encompasses classical and traditional music, opera, literature and
poetry, drama, ballet and the visual arts. The annual Belfast Festival at Queen’s
University is the second largest international festival in Britain. Among
musicians who have achieved international distinction are the flautist James
Galway, the soprano Heather Harper and the pianist Barry Douglas, winner of
the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1986.
The National Health Service provides both hospital and practitioner services,
and health and personal social services correspond fairly closely to those in the
rest of the United Kingdom, although the administrative framework is different.
While publicly maintained schools are open to children of all religions, in
practice, Protestants and Roman Catholics are for the most part educated in
separate schools, although there is one publicly maintained integrated school
and a small number of independent integrated schools. Contrary to develop¬
ments in the rest of the United Kingdom, emphasis on the comprehensive
principle in secondary schools has been very small. Links between the two
universities and industry are well developed. Considerable progress has been
made in improving housing and the urban environment, notably in Belfast, and
home ownership is increasing significantly. Major new town centre develop¬
ments are taking place in Belfast, Londonderry and other towns which provide
greatly improved shopping facilities. Planning and conservation arrangements
are much like those in the rest of the country.
Distinctive local programmes are broadcast and there is a local press; national
radio and television networks are received, however, and the national press is
sold widely. Sport has an important role in the community, and many
world-class sportsmen and sportswomen have come from Northern Ireland,
including the boxer Barry McGuigan and the snooker player Dennis Taylor.
The Social Framework
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly in the second
half of the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes
include a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher divorce rate,
widening educational opportunities, technical progress and a higher standard
of living.
With 56-8 million people in 1986, Britain ranks about fifteenth in the world in
terms of population. This compares with 38-2 million in 1901, about 9 million at
the end of the seventeenth century and some 2 million at the end of the eleventh
century. Early figures are based on contemporary estimates, but from the

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Birth Rates
Mortality
beginning of the nineteenth centmy relatively plentiful and reliable information
is available. Most of it comes from two main sources: the regular flow since 1837
of statistical information based on compulsory registration of births, marriages
and deaths, and the censuses taken regularly every ten years since 1801
(because of war there was no census in 1941). The most recent was in 1981.
After 1975 the population fell slightly for about three years, for the first time
(other than in war) since records began, reflecting a temporary decline in the
birth rate. Since then the upward trend has been resumed, except for a slight
decline in 1982. Projections suggest that population growth will continue at a
low rate. Britain’s total population is expected, on mid-1985 projections, to be
57-5 million in 1991, 59 million in 2001 and 59-4 million in 2011.
In 1986 there were 755,000 live births in Britain, 4,300 more than in 1985,
which outnumbered deaths (660,700) by 94,300. The total period fertility rate
(an indication of the average size of family) remains below the level of 21
required for the replacement of the population, although it is projected to
increase from 1-8 in 1986 to 2 0 in the early twenty-first century.
Several factors may have contributed to the relatively low birth rate (13-3 live
births per 1,000 population in 1986). Contraception has become more
widespread and effective, making it easier to plan families, and voluntaiy
sterilisation of men and women has also become more common. An appreciable
proportion of pregnancies (in 1985 about 37 per cent of those conceived outside
marriage and 7 per cent of those conceived within marriage) are ended by legal
abortion.
The postponement of conception within marriage coupled with a trend
towards later marriage has led to an increase, to 26, in the average age at which
women have their first child in marriage. Another feature is the current
preference for smaller families than in the past, especially two-children families,
which has led to a significant decline in the proportion of families with four or
more children.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is about 71 years and for a woman 77
years compared with 49 years for men and 52 years for women in 1901. The
improving health of the population has mainly had the effect of increasing
young people’s chances of reaching the older age groups. Life expectancy in the
older age groups has increased relatively little.
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population. However, there has been a considerable decline
in mortality at most ages, particularly among children and young adults. The
infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births)
was 9-5 in 1986; neonatal mortality (deaths of infants under four weeks old per
1,000 live births) was 5-3 in 1986; and maternal mortality is about 0-1 per 1,000
live births.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising
standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene, and the smaller size of families. Deaths resulting from
infectious diseases (notably tuberculosis) have virtually disappeared, although
as in other countries the spread of the disease AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome) is causing concern; by the end of June 1987, 870 cases of
AIDS had been reported, of which 490 had resulted in the patient’s death.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases (including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, the next largest cause of death being cancer
(responsible for nearly one-quarter of deaths). Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in Britain, accounting for some 100,000

premature deaths a year, but there has been a significant decline in the
incidence of smoking, with 36 per cent of adult males and 32 per cent of adult
females smoking cigarettes in 1984, as against 52 and 41 per cent respectively
in 1972.
During the last 20 years there has been a marked change in the pattern of
marriage. In 1972 there were 480,300 marriages in Britain, but by 1982 the
number had declined to 387,000, with a subsequent increase to 394,000 in
1986. Of the population aged 16 or over in England and Wales in 1986, 60 per
cent were married, 26 per cent single, 9 per cent widowed and 5 per cent
divorced. The trend of the 1960s towards earlier marriage was reversed at the
beginning of the 1970s, since when there has been a slow increase in the
average age for first marriages, which in England and Wales is now 26 for men
and 24 for women. In 1986 remarriages (of one or both parties) accounted for
about 35 per cent of all marriages in Britain, compared with about 20 per cent in
1971 and 14 per cent in 1961. Some 12 per cent of all marriages in 1986 were
remarriages where both partners had been divorced.
The divorce rate has been increasing steadily and in 1986 about 13 decrees of
divorce were made absolute for every 1,000 married couples in England and
Wales, compared with two per 1,000 in 1961. The rates are lower in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. In 1986 about 154,000 divorces were granted in England
and Wales; the proportion granted to wives was about 71 per cent. The average
age of people at the time of divorce in England and Wales is now about 38 for
men and 35 for women.
Another feature, common to many other Western European countries, has
been a considerable increase in cohabitation. Over one-quarter of women in
Great Britain mariying during the period 1980 to 1983 where the marriage was
the first for both parties had lived with their husbands before marriage
(compared with 7 per cent for those married in the early 1970s) and about 13 per
cent of non-married women aged 18 to 49 were cohabiting during 1983-84.
Cohabitation occurs more frequently for separated or divorced women than for
single women. There is some evidence of a growing number of stable
non-married relationships in that half of illegitimate births (which now account
for 21 per cent of live births in Britain compared with 6 per cent in 1961) are
registered by both parents.
Although the total population has remained relatively stable in the last decade,
there have been noticeable changes in the age and sex structure, including a
decline in the proportion of young people under 16 and an increase in the
proportion of elderly people, especially those aged 85 and over. The estimated
age distribution of the British population in mid-1986 was roughly as follows:
under 16 years, nearly 21 per cent; 16-64, 64 per cent; and 65 and over, 15 per
cent. Some 18 per cent of the population were over the normal retirement ages
(65 for men and 60 for women), compared with 15 per cent in 1961.
In mid-1986 there were an estimated 29-1 million females and 27-6 million
males in Britain, representing a ratio of over 105 females to every 100 males.
There are about 5 per cent more male than female births every year. Because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point, at
about 50 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number of
men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance of
women among the elderly.
The population density is about 233 per sq km, which is relatively high in
comparison with most other countries. England is the most densely populated
with 362 people per sq km (with Greater London having a density of 4,288
22
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Migration
people per sq km), and Scotland the least densely populated with 65 people per
sq km, while Wales and Northern Ireland have 136 and 111 people per sq km
respectively.
Table 2 gives figures for some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half of
the population lives in a belt across England, with south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire at one end, the London area at the other, and the industrialised
midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are: the central
lowlands of Scotland: north-east England from north of the river Tyne down to
the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast
from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the eastern
fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuaiy, and the far south
west. Most of the mountainous parts, including much of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland and the central Pennines, are very sparsely populated.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a general trend, especially in
London, for people to move away from the congested urban centres into the
suburbs. The 1981 census recorded that only in the remoter rural areas had the
rate of population growth been higher in the 1970s than in the 1960s. There has
also been a geographical redistribution of the population from Scotland and the
northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South West and the East
Midlands. Another feature has been an increase in the rate of retirement
migration, the main recipient areas (where in some towns the elderly can form
over one-third of the population) being the south coast of England and East
Anglia.

Traditionally, there is a net population loss from Britain due to migration to the
restofthe world, but in 1986 there was a net gain of 37,000.1 Between 1981 and
1986 some 1-23 million people left Britain to live abroad and about 1-24 million
came from overseas to live in Britain, so that net immigration increased the
population by about 13,000. Of the 213,000 departing residents in 1986, 24 per
cent left for Australia, Canada or New Zealand, 12 per cent for other
Commonwealth countries, 27 per cent for other European Community

countries, 16 per cent for the United States and 7 per cent for the Middle East.
Of the 250,000 new residents, 12 per cent came from Australia, Canada or New
Zealand, 20 per cent from other Commonwealth countries and 28 per cent from
other European Community countries. Many of those coming into Britain, as
well as those going abroad, are British citizens.
Nationality legislation is embodied in the British Nationality Act 1981, which
came into force on 1 January 1983. Under this Act, citizenship of the United
Kingdom and Colonies was replaced by three citizenships: British citizenship
for people closely connected with Britain, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of
Man; British Dependent Territories citizenship for people connected with the
dependencies; and British Overseas citizenship for those citizens of the United
Kingdom and Colonies who did not acquire either of the other citizenships. With
one small exception, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had the
right of abode in Britain when the Act came into force acquired British
citizenship.
British citizenship is acquired automatically at birth by a child born in Britain
if his or her father or mother is a British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a British citizen. A child born abroad to
a British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or registered in Britain is a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the citizenship of a child born abroad to a
British citizen in Crown service, certain related services, or in service under a
European Community institution. British citizenship may also be acquired by
registration by certain children born in Britain who do not automatically
acquire such citizenship at birth or born abroad to a parent who is a citizen by
descent; by British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens,
British subjects under the Act (three very limited categories) and British
protected persons after five years’ residence in Britain (except for people from
Gibraltar, who may be registered without residence); and by naturalisation for
Commonwealth citizens, citizens of the Irish Republic, and foreign nationals.
The British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 conferred British citizenship
(with effect from 1 January 1983) on those Falkland Islanders who did not
acquire it under the 1981 Act. For naturalisation, which is at the Home
Secretary’s discretion, five years’ residence, good character and sufficient
knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic are required except for the
spouse of a British citizen, who needs only three years’ residence and no
language qualification. Most existing entitlements to registration (including
those for Commonwealth citizens and Irish citizens settled in Britain since
before 1973, and in certain circumstances that for women married to citizens of
the United Kingdom and Colonies before 1983) were preserved for five years from
1 January 1983.
Special arrangements covering the status of British Dependent Territories
citizens connected with Hong Kong when the territory returns to the People’s
Republic of China in 1997 are made by the Hong Kong (British Nationality)
Order 1986.
In 1986, 38,000 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation or registration
in the United Kingdom.
Immigration into the United Kingdom is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971
(as amended by the British Nationality Act 1981) and the Immigration Rules
made in accordance with the Act. British citizens under the British Nationality
Act 1981 and those Commonwealth citizens who had the right of abode before
1 January 1983 (when the 1981 Act came into force) have the right of abode and
are not subject to immigration control. Those who do not have this right require
permission to enter and remain in the United Kingdom, which is given in

accordance with the rules. These, which are approved by Parliament and which
may be changed from time to time, set out the requirements to be met by those
seeking entry whether in a temporary capacity, for example as students or
visitors, or with the intention of taking employment or setting up in business or
for settlement as the dependants of a person already settled in the United
Kingdom. Nationals from certain countries require a visa before they can enter
the United Kingdom. Other nationals subject to immigration control require
entry clearance when coming to settle in the United Kingdom and in certain
other circumstances. Visas and other entry clearances are normally obtained
from the nearest British diplomatic post in a person’s home country.
In accordance with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Treaty of
Rome, European Community nationals do not require entry clearances nor are
they subject to restrictions on their freedom to take or seek work. The United
Kingdom similarly respects its obligations under the United Nations Convention
and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.
In 1986, 46,800 people were accepted for settlement, some 8,500 fewer than in
1985. A third of these were from the South Asian sub-continent and half were
the wives and children of men settled in the United Kingdom.
This section deals (to some extent in broad and informal terms) with social
developments affecting many sections of the population.
The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in
families or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people
in the armed services and in educational or other institutions. In 1985 just
under four-fifths of people living in private households lived in a unit headed by
a married couple.
Among many changes in household and family structure is the continuing fall
in the average size of households in Great Britain from over four people in 1911
to 3-09 in 1961 and 2-56 in 1985. The fall reflects a greater proportion of people
living on their own (10 per cent) or in one-parent families, the increasing
number of elderly people (more of whom are living alone), and the preferences of
parents for smaller families. The trend towards smaller households (24 per cent
of households consist of one person) is expected to continue and the number of
one-person households is forecast to increase substantially in the next few
years.
A growing proportion of households, over 60 per cent, own or are buying their
own homes, owner-occupation being higher among married couples than for
single, divorced or widowed household heads. The number of owner-occupied
dwellings rose from over 4 million in 1951 to nearly 14 million in 1985. Four
British households out of five live in houses rather than flats.
Nearly half of Britain’s housing has been built since 1945. Recent housing
developments have been concentrated in suburban areas. Many families now
live in houses grouped in small terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually
of two storeys with gardens, and providing two main ground-floor living rooms,
a kitchen, from two to four bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories.
Originally, many houses were located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads,
but in recent years housing estates have nearly always been sited away from
main roads. In inner urban areas slum clearance and redevelopment have been
major features of post-1945 public housing programmes. While high-rise flats
were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, the emphasis in new building is now on
low-rise, high-density designs, often incorporating gardens or patios.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 97 per cent of households
in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and a similar proportion
LAND AND PEOPLE
25
Living
Standards
sole use of an inside lavatory (high percentages by international standards)
while 69 per cent have central heating.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been the
growth of car ownership; about 62 per cent of households have the use of at least
one car (or van), including 17 per cent with the use of two or more. Greater
access to motorised transport and the construction of a network of modern
trunk roads and motorways have resulted in a considerable increase in personal
mobility and changed leisure patterns, and have influenced the design of
housing estates and shopping areas. Most detached or semi-detached houses in
new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-town shopping centres, which
normally include large supermarkets, are usually planned for the motorist.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution arising from motor vehicle emissions. Public transport
has been affected, and many services have been reduced or withdrawn,
especially in rural areas. However, greater competition in express coach services
has resulted in more long-distance and commuter coach services being
provided, and deregulation of local bus services in 1986 is beginning to have an
impact, the most important effect being the introduction of minibuses in many
areas.
There has been a steady reduction of the main atmospheric and freshwater
pollutants that have been of concern in the past, producing dramatic improve¬
ments in, for example, the quality of the air in cities and the condition of major
rivers, although various forms of pollution from traffic and industrial processes
remain a problem in some areas. There is a high degree of concern for the
environment, as shown by the growth in the number of organisations (especially
voluntary societies) concerned with conservation.
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth century, but generally at a slower rate than in some other major
industrialised countries. Although gross domestic product (GDP) per head fell in
the early 1980s, Britain has experienced an economic recovery and is now into
its seventh successive year of growth, with growth since 1980 being higher than
in the other major European Community countries. In the year to the first
quarter of 1987 GDP grew by over 4 per cent in real terms, with growth
occurring throughout the economy, both in manufacturing and services.
Inflation is at a much lower level than in the early 1980s; in July 1987 the index
of retail prices was 4-4 per cent higher than in July 1986.
Long-term trends in the pattern of expenditure show a substantial rise in
expenditure on housing, televisions, video recorders, telephones, electrical and
some other durable goods, motor vehicles and a range of services. Some durable
goods, such as televisions and refrigerators, are available in more than 90 per
cent of households. Of durable goods shown in the diagram on p 26, ownership
of telephones, freezers and central heating systems is growing most rapidly;
other durable goods which have grown in popularity include music centres and
other audio equipment, video recorders and home computers.
The general level of nutrition remains high. Over the last 25 years there have
been substantial rises in the consumption of poultry, instant coffee and
processed (including frozen) vegetables and fruit, while home consumption per
person of mutton and lamb, beef and veal, bread, potatoes, eggs, milk, butter,
sugar, tea and some other foods has fallen. However, another feature has been
an increase in the number of meals eaten away from home, either at work or in
restaurants, and a growth in the consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and
fast-food' shops. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the proportion of
convenience foods eaten grew as women increasingly went out to work and had
26

Availability of Certain Durable Goods
Per cent of households with goods
less time to prepare meals, and as the variety of prepared foods rose in line with
the growth in ownership of refrigerators and freezers. There is some evidence of
consumption of food being influenced by health factors, for example, the growth
in the consumption of skimmed milk and the move from consumption of
standard white bread towards wholemeal and other breads.
Alcohol consumption has risen substantially since the 1950s and alcohol
abuse has become a problem although the level is well below that in some other
European Community countries. Beer remains much the most popular alcoholic
drink. A high proportion of beer is drunk in public houses (‘pubs’), which are a
traditional social centre for many people, and in clubs. A notable development
has been the increase in consumption of lager, now estimated to account for
over half of beer sales. Consumption of light (table) wine has increased
considerably in recent years, although there has been little change in the
consumption of higher strength wines such as sherry and port. The pattern of
spirits consumption has also been changing, with a decline in the consumption
of whisky and gin, and higher consumption of some other spirits.
Employment has been increasing since 1983, representing the longest period
of continuous employment growth for nearly 30 years. However, the pattern of
employment has altered considerably, with a substantial decline in employment
in manufacturing industry being accompanied by a long-term increase in the
numbers employed in service industries. Another feature has been an increase
in the number of self-employed, now accounting for nearly 10 per cent of the
working population. Earnings from employment are the main source of income
for most people; in 1985 wages and salaries accounted for 60 per cent of
household income. The distribution of pre-tax income has remained relatively
stable over a long period, the lower 50 per cent of income earners accounting for
some 22 to 24 per cent of pre-tax income since 1949. Income before tax of the
LAND AND PEOPLE

Opportunities
self-employed is less evenly distributed than total income, mostly because of the
very large incomes of a small number of people, mainly professionals such as
lawyers, accountants and doctors. The combined effect of the tax system and the
receipt of benefits is to redistribute incomes on a more equal basis.
Wealth is much less evenly distributed, with the top 1 per cent of the
population aged 18 or over owning about 21 per cent of marketable wealth, and
the top 10 per cent having 52 per cent. The inclusion of‘non-marketable’ rights
in occupational and state pension schemes reduces these shares substantially to
around 12 and 35 per cent respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has been
little change in the distribution of marketable wealth or in that of marketable
wealth plus occupational and state pension rights. The proportion of net wealth
held in shares has been declining, but the Government’s privatisation pro¬
gramme has had a major effect on the pattern of share ownership, with a survey
early in 1987 indicating that nearly 20 per cent of the adult population in Great
Britain were shareholders, as against 7 per cent in 1979.
Considerable changes have occurred in the twentieth century in the economic
and domestic lives of women, due, in part, to the removal of almost all sex
discrimination in political and legal rights. At the heart of women’s changed role
has been the rise in the number of women, particularly married women, at work.
With later marriages and the availability of effective methods of family planning
there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved in
child-bearing for a much shorter time and this, together with a variety of other
factors which have made housework less burdensome, has made it possible for
women with even young children to combine raising a family with employment.
Childminding arrangements are now more generally available and the growth of
part-time work, job-sharing and flexible working hours, together with training
and retraining schemes, allow women to take advantage of more employment
opportunities.
Women comprise 42 per cent of the British labour force and the proportion of
married women who work outside the home has grown to over 60 per cent of
those between the ages of 16 and 60. There is still a significant difference
between women’s and men’s earnings but the equal pay legislation which came
into force at the end of 1975 has narrowed the gap. Women’s average hourly
earnings, exclusive of overtime (for full-time employees), increased from just
under two-thirds of those of men in 1970, to nearly three-quarters in 1986.
Nevertheless, women’s wages remain relatively low because women tend to work
in lowly paid sectors of the economy and they work less overtime than men.
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986 make discrimination between men
and women unlawful in employment, education, training and the provision of
housing, goods, facilities and services. Discriminatory advertisements which
breach the Act are also unlawful. In most cases complaints of discrimination are
dealt with by industrial tribunals since they concern employment; others may be
taken before county courts in England and Wales or the sheriff court in
Scotland. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, women in Great
Britain are entitled to equal pay with men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, or work which is of equal value. There is similar legislation on
sex discrimination and equal pay in Northern Ireland. The Equal Opportunities
Commission was set up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland under separate
legislation) to enforce the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act. Its
statutory duties are to work towards the elimination of discrimination and to
promote equality of opportunity. The Commission advises people of their rights
under both Acts and may give financial or other assistance to help individuals to
conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It also has power to conduct

Ethnic and
National

Act
investigations and to issue notices requiring discriminatory practices to stop. In
addition, it keeps legislation under review and may submit proposals for
amending it to the ministers concerned. The Commission seeks to make women
more aware of the opportunities available to them and its information centre is a
national source of material on all aspects of equality.
People have been coming to settle in Britain for centuries from many parts of the
world. Some came to avoid political or religious persecution, others to find a
better way of life or an escape from poverty.
The Irish have long made homes in Britain. Many Jewish refugees started a
new life in the country towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the
1930s, and after 1945 large numbers of other European refugees settled in
Britain. The large communities from the West Indies and South Asian
sub-continent date principally from the 1950s and 1960s. There are also
sizeable groups of Americans, Australians, Chinese and various European
communities such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. More
recently Ugandan Asians and people from Latin America, Indo-China and Sri
Lanka have sought refuge in Britain.
In 1983—85, according to the results of a sample survey, the non-white
population of Great Britain was nearly 2-4 million (some 4 per cent of the total
population) of whom about 40 per cent were born in Britain. Although they are
disproportionately concentrated in areas of greatest deprivation in the inner
cities where the disadvantages they share with the poorer sections of the
indigenous community are compounded by racial discrimination, progress has
undoubtedly been made over the last 20 years in several areas of life. Many
individuals have achieved distinction in their careers and in public life and the
proportion of ethnic minority workers in professional and managerial jobs has
increased. The growth of commercial enterprise has been significant, particu¬
larly among Asians, and there are numerous examples of self-help in ethnic
minority communities.
The principal means of combating disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health programmes of central government and
local authorities, as well as through special programmes which channel extra
resources into projects to benefit ethnic minorities specifically. The latter
provide, for example, such staff as specialist teachers for those groups of
children who need English language tuition, business support services and
measures to revive local economies and improve the environment in inner city
areas. Cultural and recreational schemes are funded, including community and
social centres for different ethnic minorities, and the health and personal social
services make special provision for certain groups.
The welfare of ethnic minorities and good relations between minorities and
the local community are promoted by community relations councils and other
voluntary bodies. In recognition of the tensions that can arise between the police
and ethnic minorities, consultation between the police and the community has
been made a statutory requirement, liaison work is undertaken in the schools
and police training in race relations has received particular attention.
Policies for promoting equality of opportunity in a multiracial society in which
all citizens receive equal respect are pursued against a background of legislation
against discrimination. The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination
unlawful on grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origin in
the provision of goods, facilities and services, in employment, training and
related matters, in education, in housing and in advertising. It strengthened
legislation passed in 1968 which, in turn, widened the scope of the first race
relations legislation enacted in 1965. It also strengthened the criminal law on
LAND AND PEOPLE
29

Racial Equality
Leisure
Trends
incitement to racial hatred which was further reinforced by the Public Order Act
1986.
The 1976 Act brought the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see p 27), and gave complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
The Commission for Racial Equality was established by the Race Relations Act
1976 with statutory duties to work towards the elimination of discrimination
and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of
different racial groups. It has power to investigate unlawful discriminatory
practices and to issue non-discrimination notices, requiring that such practices
should cease. It has an important educational role and has issued a code of
practice in employment. It is also the principal source of advice for the general
public about the Race Relations Act and has discretion to assist individuals with
their complaints.
The Commission supports the work of the 100 or so community relations
councils, which are autonomous, voluntary bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to promote equality of opportunity and
good relations at the local level. It makes grants towards the salaries of the
community relations officers employed by the councils, most of whom also
receive funds from their local authorities, and gives grants to ethnic minority
self-help groups and to other projects run by or for the benefit of the minority
communities.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of
full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer because of voluntary overtime. A large majority of
employees work a five-day week.
The most common leisure activities are home based, or social, such as visiting
or entertaining relatives or friends. Television viewing is by far the most popular
leisure pastime, and nearly all households have a television set, with 86 per cent
in 1985 having a colour set. Over 50 per cent of households have two or more
television sets and average viewing time for the population aged four and over is
about 27 hours a week. Growing numbers are using video recorders to watch
programmes at times other than their transmission; the proportion of
households with a video recorder rose from 24 per cent in 1984 to 31 per cent in
1985. Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio, records or
cassettes; reading; do-it-yourself home improvements such as house painting
and decorating; going out for a meal or for a drink or to the cinema or to watch a
sporting event; gardening; outings (such as visits to the countryside, seaside or
to museums); photography; visits to social clubs and leisure centres; and social
and voluntary work. About half the households in Britain have a pet, the most
common being dogs (of which there are thought to be over 6 million in Britain)
and cats, the number of which has gradually risen to about 6 million.
Sports and other pastimes have grown in popularity, reflected by increasing
membership of the main organisations concerned with outdoor activities,
although for some sports, such as greyhound racing, the number of spectators
has been declining. Walking and swimming are the two most popular sporting
activities, being almost equally undertaken by men and women. Snooker/
billiards/pool and darts are the next most popular sports among men. Aerobics
(keep-fit exercises) and yoga, squash and cycling are among the sports where
participation has been increasing in recent years.
Holiday entitlements have increased for most full-time employees, and by the
end of 1986, 99 per cent of manual workers had a basic holiday entitlement of
30
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
four weeks or more and nearly one-quarter five weeks or more. In 1986 some 60
per cent of the population took at least one long holiday of four or more nights
away from home, the main holiday period being from May to September. The
number of long holidays taken by British residents was 49 million in 1986
(compared with 45 million in 1976), of which 31-5 million were taken in Britain.
The most popular destinations for summer holidays are the West Country and
southern England. In addition, some 32 million shorter holidays were taken in
1986. British residents also took over 17 million holidays overseas in 1986, of
which nearly two-thirds involved ‘package’ arrangements. The most popular
destinations were Spain, France and Greece.
2 Government
The United Kingdom constitution, unlike that of most other countries, is not
contained in any single document. Formed partly by statute, partly by common
law and partly by convention, it can be altered by Act of Parliament, or by general
agreement to create, vary or abolish a convention. The constitution thus adapts
readily to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are clearly distinguishable although their functions
often intermingle and overlap. The legislature. Parliament, is the supreme
authority. The executive consists of: (1) the Government—Cabinet and other
ministers who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(2) government departments, which are responsible for national administration;
(3) local authorities, which administer and manage many local services; and
(4) public corporations responsible for operating particular nationalised indus¬
tries or, for example, a social or cultural service, subject to ministerial control in
varying degrees. The judiciary determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both legislature and executive.
The Monarchy
The British people look to the Queen not only as their head of State, but also as
the symbol of their nation’s unity. The monarchy is the most ancient secular
institution in the United Kingdom. During the last thousand years its
continuity has only once been broken (by the establishment of a republic which
lasted from 1649 to 1660) and, despite interruptions in the direct line of
succession, the hereditary principle upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. The royal title in the United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the
Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of
Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender
of the Faith’. The form of the royal title is varied for those other member states of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of State,1 to suit the particular
circumstances of each. Other member states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the
other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of
State, her representative is the Governor-General appointed by her on the advice
of the ministers of the country concerned and completely independent of the
United Kingdom Government.
In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by
governors, who are responsible to the British Government for the good
government of the countries concerned.
1 The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is head of State are: Antigua and
Barbuda. Australia. Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea. Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.

Succession,
Accession and

Acts of
Government
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common law
rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of a granddaughter of James I of
England and VI of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of Hanover) are alone
eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue in its
present line, it can be altered only by common consent of the member nations of
the Commonwealth of which the Queen is Sovereign.
The sons of the Sovereign have precedence over the daughters in succeeding
to the throne. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and the
powers of the Crown are vested in her as though she were a king. While the
consort of a king takes her husband’s rank and style, the constitution does not
give any special rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen-Regnant although
in practice he fills an important role in the life of the nation, as does the Duke of
Edinburgh.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon as his or her predecessor dies
and there is no interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed at an Accession
Council to which all members of the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords
Spiritual and Temporal (see p 36), the Lord Mayor and Aldermen and other
leading citizens of the City of London are also invited.
The Sovereign's coronation follows the accession after a convenient interval. It
is a ceremony which has remained essentially the same for over a thousand
years, even if details have often been modified to conform to the customs of the
time. It takes place at Westminster Abbey in London in the presence of
representatives of the Houses of Parliament and of all the great public interests
of the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations, and of representatives of other countries.
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is head of the executive, an integral
part of the legislature, head of the judiciary, the commander-in-chief of all armed
forces of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the established Church of
England. As a result of a long process of evolution, during which the monarchy’s
absolute power has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of
her ministers, which she cannot ignore. The United Kingdom is governed by Her
Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred years
towards assigning powers directly to ministers, there are still important acts of
government which require the participation of the Queen. These include
summoning, proroguing (discontinuing until the next session without disso¬
lution) and dissolving Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by
Parliament; appointing many important office holders, including government
ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats and
bishops and some other senior clergy of the Church of England; conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours1; and remitting all or part of the
penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. An important function is
appointing the Prime Minister and by convention the Queen invites the leader of
the political party which commands a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. In international affairs, the Queen as head of State has the power
to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign states and governments, to
conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (as when appointing the Prime Minister), those acts
involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowadays performed by
government ministers who are responsible to Parliament and can be questioned
about a particular policy. It is not necessary to have Parliament’s authority to

are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the
Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

exercise these powers, although Parliament has the power to restrict or abolish a
prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility in no way detracts from the importance of the
Queen's role in the smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the
Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other officials in Britain and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
numerous state papers; she must be informed and consulted on every aspect of
national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to perform them should the Queen be
totally incapacitated. The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the
Queen’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, there is provision for appointing
Counsellors of State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in line of
succession, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Queen may delegate certain
royal functions. However, Counsellors of State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the Queen's express instructions), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and, in
spite of the change in the outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, many
traditional customs and ceremonies are retained. Royal marriages and royal
funerals are marked by public ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits
Britain; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as a State opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives from Buckingham Palace to Westminster. Each year the Queen
and other members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom.
Their presence at scientific, artistic, industrial and charitable events of national
and local importance encourages nationwide interest and publicity. The Queen
pays state visits to foreign governments, accompanied by the Duke of
Edinburgh. She also undertakes lengthy tours in the other countries of the
Commonwealth. Other members of the royal family pay official visits overseas,
occasionally representing the Queen, and often in connection with an organisa¬
tion or a cause with which they are associated.
About 85 per cent of all expenditure arising from the royal family’s official duties
is met by public departments. This includes the costs of the royal yacht, the
Queen's Flight, travel by train and the upkeep of the royal palaces. The Queen’s
public expenditure on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out official duties
as head of State is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament. (In 1987
this was £4-3 million.) Her private expenditure as Sovereign is met from the
Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly from the revenues of the Duchy of
Lancaster1; and her personal expenditure as a private individual from her own
personal resources. There are annual allowances approved by Parliament to
other members of the royal family, though not to the Prince of Wales, who as
Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the estate of the Duchy of
Cornwall (he voluntarily surrenders a quarter of the revenue to the Exchequer).

The Functions
of Parliament
The Meeting of
Parliament
Parliament
Parliament is the supreme legislative authority. Its three elements, the Queen,
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, are outwardly separate,
are constituted on different principles, and meet together only on occasions of
symbolic significance such as the State opening of Parliament when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
body, however. Parliament usually requires the concurrence of all its parts.
Parliament can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, for any of the
constituent parts of the country separately, or for any combination of them. It
can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are Crown
dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, having subordinate
legislatures which make laws on island affairs.1
Free from any legal restraints imposed by a written constitution, Parliament is
able to legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however. Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way. Its
members bear in mind the common law and have tended to act in accordance
with precedent and tradition. The validity of an Act of Parliament which has
been duly passed, promulgated and published cannot be disputed in the law
courts, but no Parliament would be likely to pass an Act which it knew would
receive no public support. The system of party government helps to ensure that
Parliament legislates with its responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises the
various types of Community legislation, and sends 81 elected members to the
European Parliament.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws, (2) to provide, by voting
taxation, the means of carrying on the work of government, (3) to scrutinise
government policy and administration, particularly proposals for expenditure,
and (4) to debate the great political issues of the day. In discharging these
functions Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the
electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all
important international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being,
in theory at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government
and not subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five years, but is often dissolved and a
general election held before the end of this term. The maximum life has been
prolonged by legislation in such rare circumstances as the two world wars.
Dissolution and writs for a general election are ordered by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments' at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late (English) Spring Bank Holiday and during a long summer recess
starting in late July or early August. The average number of ‘sitting' days in a
session is about 175 in the House of Commons and about 150 in the House of
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy Council and the local assemblies. It
is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the Privy Council member primarily concerned with island
affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
36

The House of
Lords
Lords. At the start of each session the Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines the
Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is terminated by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued' until the new
session opens (on occasions Parliament has been dissolved without proro¬
gation). A short speech is made on behalf of the Queen summarising
Parliament’s work during the past session. An adjournment does not affect
uncompleted business, but prorogation terminates nearly all parliamentary
business, so that all public Bills not completed lapse, and must be reintroduced
in the next session unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal consist of (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, (2) all
life peers and peeresses, and (3) those Lords of Appeal (‘law lords’) created life
peers to assist the House in its judicial duties. Hereditary peerages carry a right
to sit in the House (subject to certain disqualifications), provided the holder
establishes his or her claim and is 21 years of age or over, but anyone succeeding
to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his
or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the House but gain the
right to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to the
House of Commons.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. They are usually granted in recognition of service
in politics or other walks of life. Some peers are created because the Government
of the day wishes to have the recipient in the House of Lords. The House also
provides a place in Parliament for men and women whose advice is useful to the
State, but who do not wish to be involved in party politics.
In mid-1987 there were 1,187 members of the House of Lords, including the
two archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords Temporal consisted of 763
hereditary peers who had succeeded to their titles, 29 hereditary peers who have
had their titles conferred on them (including the Prince of Wales), and 369 life
peers, of whom 21 were ‘law lords’. Of the total, 89 peers were not in receipt of a
writ of summons and some 150 peers were on leave of absence from the House
(see below). Of the 117 Irish peers 47 were entitled to sit in the House of Lords
because they were holders of an English, Scottish or United Kingdom peerage.
Other Irish peerages do not entitle their holders to membership of the House of
Lords.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings.1 Peers
who frequently attend the House- (the average daily attendance is some 300)
include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in public service.
They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but can recover expenses
incurred in attending the House and certain travelling expenses (for which there
are maximum daily rates).
The House is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack2 as ex-officio Speaker of the House. In his absence his place may be
taken by a deputy speaker, a deputy chairman or, if neither is present, by a
speaker chosen by the Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord
1 Some hereditary peers do not establish their claim to succeed and so do not receive a writ of
summons entitling them to sit in the House. Lords may apply for leave of absence for the
duration, or for the remainder, of a Parliament.

Commonwealth countries; it is a relic from the medieval period when wool was the greatest source
of the country's wealth.

Chairman of Committees, who is appointed at the beginning of each session and
takes the chair in all committees, unless the House decides otherwise. The Lord
Chairman and the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees are salaried
officers of the House.
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings, including judgments, and for the
promulgation of Acts of Parliament, and who is also the accounting officer for
money voted to the House; the other Clerks at the Table who, with the Clerk of
the Parliaments and the other officers and officials of the House, are collectively
known as the Parliament Office; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, who is
also Serjeant at Arms in attendance upon the Lord Chancellor and is responsible
for security, accommodation and services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster; and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Seijeant at Arms
and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of Commons is elected by universal adult suffrage and consists of 650
Members of Parliament (MPs). At present 41 are women. Of the 650 seats, 523
are for England, 38 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and 17 for Northern Ireland.
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies or resigns1 or is given a peerage, a
by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary of £22,548 (from
January 1988) and an office costs allowance of £20,140. They also have a
number of other allowances, including travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial members, subsistence allowances and
allowances for second homes. (For ministers’ salaries, see p 49.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, elected by MPs to
preside over the House. Other officers are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and
two deputy chairmen who act as Deputy Speakers, elected by the House on the
nomination of the Government. They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity. The House is administered by a Commission
chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs) include the Clerk of the House of
Commons, who is the principal adviser to the Speaker of the House on its
privileges and procedures; his department has responsibilities relating to the
conduct of the business of the House and its many committees. The Clerk is also
accounting officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms, who waits upon the
Speaker, carries out certain orders of the House, is the official housekeeper of
the Commons part of the building, and is responsible for its security. Other
officers serve the House in the Library, the Department of the Official Report
(Hansard), the Administration Department and the Refreshment Department.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure equitable
representation four permanent Boundary Commissions, one each for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, make periodic reviews of constituencies
and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem necessary in the light
of population movements or other changes.
Elections are by secret ballot. British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the Irish Republic resident in the
United Kingdom, may vote provided they are aged 18 or over, registered in the
annual register of electors for the constituency and not subject to any
' An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so only by using the technical device of
applying for an office under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward of the Manor
of Northstead), ancient offices which disqualify the holder from membership of the House but
which carry no salary and have no responsibilities.

disqualification. People not entitled to vote include members of the House of
Lords, patients detained under mental health legislation, sentenced prisoners
and people convicted within the previous five years of corrupt or illegal election
practices. Service voters (members of the armed forces and their spouses. Crown
servants and staff of the British Council employed overseas, together with their
wives or husbands if accompanying them) may be registered for an address in a
constituency where they would live but for their service. In February 1987, the
franchise was extended when the right to vote was granted to overseas electors,
that is, British citizens who had been resident in the United Kingdom and
registered as electors within the previous five years.
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a polling station. Anyone
who is entitled to an absent vote may vote by post or by proxy, but postal ballot
papers cannot be sent to addresses outside the United Kingdom. Service voters,
overseas electors, electors who are physically incapacitated or unable to vote in
person because of the nature of their work may vote by post or by proxy for an
indefinite period. In February 1987, the right to apply for an absent vote at a
particular election was extended to any elector whose circumstances on polling
day are such that he or she cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at
his or her allotted polling station, for example, an elector away on holiday.
Voting is not compulsory; nearly 75 -4 per cent of a total electorate of some 43 -6
million people voted in the general election in June 1987. The candidate who
polls the most votes in a constituency is elected.
British citizens and citizens of other Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand and be elected as MPs provided they are
aged 21 or over and are not subject to any disqualification. Those disqualified
include undischarged bankrupts; people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers; and holders of certain offices listed
in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975. The latter include holders
of judicial office, civil servants, some local government officers, members of the
regular armed forces, or the police service, some members of public corporations
and government commissions, and in addition British members of the
legislature of any country or territory outside the Commonwealth. A candidate’s
nomination for election must be signed by two electors as proposer and
seconder, and by eight other electors registered in the constituency. He or she
does not require any party backing. A candidate must also deposit £500, which
is forfeited if his or her votes do not exceed 5 per cent of those validly cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend on an election campaign is £3,370
plus 2-9 pence for each elector in a borough constituency or 3-8 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. A candidate may post an election address to
each elector in the constituency, free of charge. All election expenses, apart from
the candidate’s personal expenses, are subject to the statutory limit.
The Political The party system, existing in one form or another since the eighteenth century,
Party System is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system relies heavily upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying policies before the electorate for approval. The parties are
not registered or formally recognised in law, but in practice most candidates in
elections, and almost all winning candidates, belong to one of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-party system has operated, and
since 1945 either the Conservative Party, which can trace its origins to the
eighteenth century, or the Labour Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
nineteenth century, has held power. The Liberal Party, which last formed a
government on its own in 1906—16, can also trace its origins to the eighteenth
century, while the Social Democratic Party was formed in 1981 and made an
GOVERNMENT
39
alliance with the Liberal Party in the same year. (Discussions are in progress for
a formal union of the two parties.) Other parties include two nationalist parties.
Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the Scottish National Party
(founded in 1934). In Northern Ireland there are a number of parties; the largest
of those represented in the House of Commons are the Ulster Unionist Party,
which was formed in the early part of this century, and the Democratic Unionist
Party, founded in 1971 by a group which broke away from the Ulster Unionists.
Since 1945 there have been seven Conservative and six Labour Governments
and the great majority of members of the House of Commons have represented
either the Conservative or the Labour Party. The percentages of votes cast for the
main political parties in the last general election of June 1987 and the resulting
distribution of seats in the House of Commons are given in Table 3.

The party which wins most seats (although not necessarily the most votes) at a
general election, or which has the support of a majority of members in the House
of Commons, usually forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of the
majority party is asked by the Sovereign to form a government; and about 100 of
its members in the House of Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including appointment to the Cabinet—see p 49) on
the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official
Opposition with its own leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
Leaders of the Government and Opposition sit on the front benches of the
Commons with their supporters (the back-benchers) sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also apply to the House of Lords; however.
Lords who do not wish to be associated with either the Government or the
Opposition may sit on the ‘cross-benches’. The effectiveness of the party system
40
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Procedure
in Parliament rests largely on the relationship between the Government and the
opposition parties. Depending on the relative voting strengths of the parties in
the House of Commons, the Opposition might seek to overthrow the Govern¬
ment by securing its defeat on a matter of confidence . In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; to oppose government proposals that it considers
objectionable; to secure concessions on government Bills; and to increase public
support and enhance its chances of electoral success.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses, by the Chief
Government Whips in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips. The Chief
Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to when the
question of finding time for debating some particular issue is discussed. The
Leaders of the two Houses are primarily responsible for the direction of business
and for providing facilities for the Houses to debate matters about which they
are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the party’s
voting strength by ensuring that members attend important debates, and
conveying to the party leadership the opinions of back-bench members. The
importance a party attaches to a vote on a particular issue is indicated to the
MPs by the underlining (once, twice or three times) on the notice sent to them;
failure to comply with a three-line whip' is usually seen as rebellion against the
party's policy. Party discipline tends to be less strong in the Lords than in the
Commons.
The Chief Government Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury; of the other Government Whips, three (one of whom is Deputy
Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household, five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are Assistant Whips. Salaries are also
paid to the Chief Opposition Whips in both Houses and to two of the Opposition
Assistant Whips in the Commons. The Government Whips in the Lords hold
offices in the Royal Household and act as government spokesmen.
Annual assistance from public funds helps opposition parties to carry out
their parliamentary work at Westminster. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the previous general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount is £1,500 for every seat won
plus £3 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of £450,000.
Parliamentary procedure is based on’ custom and precedent, partly formulated
in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The system of
debate is much the same in the two Houses: the subject originates in the form of
a motion (a proposal made by a member in order to elicit a decision from the
House). When a motion has been moved, the Speaker proposes the question as
the subject of debate. At the end of each debate the question may be agreed to
without voting, or else is decided by a vote on a simple majority. The main
difference between the two Houses is that in the Lords the office of Speaker
carries with it no authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being
decided by the general sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders
of the House. The Speaker of the Commons must guard against abuse of
procedure or infringement of minority rights; has discretion to allow or disallow
a closure motion (to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote);
and has powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save time in

Legislative
Proceedings
other respects. In cases of grave disorder the House can be adjourned or the
sitting suspended by the Speaker. Voting in the Commons is under the direction
of the Speaker, whose duty it is to pronounce the final result. In the event of a
tied vote the Speaker gives the casting vote, but only in accordance with
established conventions which preclude an expression of opinion on the merits
of the question.
The voting procedure in the House of Lords is similar to that in the Commons,
except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting, vote. Bills
and subordinate legislation are in general allowed to proceed in the form before
the House unless a majority votes to reject or amend them; on other motions the
question is decided in the negative unless there is a majority in favour. When the
House is sitting judicially (the Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) the
judgment under appeal is not changed if the votes are equal.
The Commons has a public register of MPs' financial interests. Members with
a relevant pecuniary interest in a matter before the House, direct or indirect,
must declare it when taking part in a debate, though to act as a disqualification
from voting the interest must be direct, immediate and personal. In any other
proceedings of the House or in transactions with other members or with
ministers or civil servants, MPs must also disclose any relevant financial interest
or benefit. There is no register of financial interests in the Lords, but peers
speaking in a debate in which they have a direct interest are expected to declare
it.
Proceedings of both Houses are public, except on extremely rare occasions; the
minutes (in the Commons called Votes and Proceedings and in the Lords,
Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of Parliamentary
Debates, Hansard) are published daily. The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together with the parliamentary and political
papers of certain past members of both Houses, are available to the public on
application to the House of Lords Record Office. The Commons is not televised,
but proceedings are recorded and sound transmissions of some are made on
television and radio, either live or recorded. A Parliamentary Sound Archive has
been established. Debates on televising proceedings have taken place on several
occasions and, most recently, in 1985 the House of Commons voted against
televising its proceedings. The proceedings of the House of Lords have been
televised since 1985.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles are
interpreted, clarified or reapplied to meet new circumstances, but substantial
changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
A draft law takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public Bills
involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private Bills
which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest. Hybrid
Bills are public Bills which may in certain respects affect private rights, and
their passage through Parliament is governed by a special procedure which
allows those affected to make representations. Public Bills can be introduced, in
either House, by a government minister or by a private’ member. Most public
Bills that become law are in practice sponsored by the Government.
Before a government Bill is finally drafted, there is normally considerable
consultation with professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other
agencies interested in the subject matter, such as major interest and pressure
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative changes
are sometimes set out in government ‘White Papers’ which may be debated in
Parliament before a Bill is introduced. From time to time consultative
42
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
documents, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out for public discussion
government proposals which are still at a formative stage.
Bills must be passed by each House. As a rule government Bills likely to raise
political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords, while those of
an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass through the Lords first.
(Consolidation Bills are always introduced in the House of Lords.) A Bill with a
mainly financial purpose is nearly always introduced in the Commons, and a Bill
involving taxation must be based on resolutions agreed by that House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a
public charge, it can only be introduced by a minister or, if brought from the
Lords, be proceeded with in the Commons if taken up by a minister, an
arrangement which gives the Government considerable control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot for
precedence in introducing a Bill on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. After the ballot a private member may also present a Bill
after question time (see p 45), or seek to introduce a Bill under the ‘ten minute
rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one against the measure,
after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill to be brought in. Private
members' Bills do not often proceed very far, but a few become law each session.
If one secures a second reading, the Government usually introduces any
necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be introduced in the
House of Lords at any time, but the time that can be given to them in the
Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses. The Bill receives
a formal first reading on introduction, is printed, and after a while (between one
day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) is given a second
reading after a debate on its general principles and merits. In the Commons a
non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second reading committee to decide
whether it should be read a second time. After a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill is usually referred for detailed examination to a standing
committee (see p 43). If the House so decides, the Bill may be referred to the
whole House sitting in committee. The committee stage is followed by the report
stage, during which further amendments may be considered. At the third
reading a Bill is reviewed in its final form and may again be debated. The House
may vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. After the third reading a
Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes through broadly the same
stages. In the Lords, after the second reading, a Bill is considered by a committee
of the whole House unless the House takes the rare decision to refer it to a Public
Bill Committee. It is then considered on report and read a third time; at all these
stages amendments may be made. A Bill which starts in the Lords and is passed
by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there. Amendments
made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first, or a com¬
promise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature. How¬
ever, if a non-governmental Lords Bill were unacceptable to the Commons it
would generally not become law since no debating time would be allotted to it.
The Lords, on the other hand, do not in general prevent a Bill insisted upon by
the Commons from finally becoming law. Normally they either accept the Bill
without changes, or amend and return it for consideration by the Commons,
who frequently agree to the amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass
without amendment Bills authorising taxation or national expenditure. A Bill
that deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month
of being sent to the Lords, whether or not they agree to it, unless the Commons

Committees

directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached between the two Houses on a
non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can in practice
delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the end of this
time it may, in accordance with the Parliament Acts, be submitted to the Queen
for royal assent, provided it has again been passed by the Commons. A Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament would require the full assent of both Houses in
the normal way.
The limitations on the power of the Lords, contained in the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949, are based on the belief that the principal legislative function of
the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a chamber of revision, com¬
plementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known as
an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, promoted by people or organisations outside Parliament (often
local authorities) to give them special powers not granted by the general law,
go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but most of the
work is done in committee, where procedures follow a semi-judicial pattern:
the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges sought and
the objections of opposing interests are heard. Both sides may be legally
represented.
Delegated legislation, used to relieve pressure on parliamentary time, gives
ministers and other authorities the power to regulate administrative details
after a law has been passed. To minimise the risk that powers thus conferred on
the executive might supersede or weaken parliamentary government, they are
normally delegated to authorities directly responsible to Parliament. Moreover,
the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in
carrying out these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right to
affirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations affected before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of these
‘statutory instruments’. In order to save time on the floor of the House, where
statutory instruments may be considered, the Commons also uses standing
committees to consider the merits of instruments, with any decisions reserved
to the House.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee (of the whole House) to consider
Bills in detail after their second reading. A committee of the whole House is
presided over by the Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees
in the House of Lords) or a deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages: two Scottish standing committees: the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee: the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on, and are each
appointed specially to consider a specific Bill. Each has between 16 and 50
members with a party balance reflecting as far as possible that in the House as a
whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish
members (and may be convened in Edinburgh), considers the principles of
Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and
other matters concerning Scotland only. The Welsh Grand Committee, with all
44

Select
Committees

Committees
Party
Committees
38 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills referred to it at second
reading stage, and matters concerning Wales only. The Northern Ireland
committee considers matters relating specifically to Northern Ireland. A
standing committee on regional affairs attended by any of the 523 members
from the English constituencies is occasionally appointed to consider matters
relating to the English regions. The Lords’ equivalent to a standing committee, a
Public Bill Committee, is rarely used.
In 1979 a new House of Commons select committee structure was set up in an
attempt to provide closer examination of government departments and policies,
and of the way ministers discharge their responsibilities.
This was in response to a recognition that Parliament was probably less
effective a check on the executive than it had been for much of the nineteenth
century. With the growth of mass political parties, the individual independence
of many MPs has tended to become subordinated to party interests, and with the
great extension of the range and complexity of central government activities,
and the parallel growth of bureaucracy, MPs have a more difficult task in
checking the actions of ministers and their departments.
The 14 committees examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the
main government departments and related bodies. The Foreign Affairs Com¬
mittee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, and there are select committees on Scottish and Welsh Affairs. The
committees are constituted on a party basis, in approximate proportions to
party strength in the House. Other regular committees include those on
European Legislation, Defence, Public Accounts, Members’ Interests, the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and Sound Broadcasting. The
Committee of Selection and the Standing Orders Committee have duties relating
to private Bills, and the Committee of Selection also chooses members to serve
on standing and select committees. A Liaison Committee considers general
matters relating to select committees. On rare occasions a parliamentary Bill is
examined by a select committee, a procedure additional to the usual legislative
process—(this occurs, for example, every few years for the Armed Forces Bill).
In their scrutiny of government policies, the committees question ministers,
senior civil servants and interested bodies and individuals. Through hearings
and published reports, they bring before Parliament and the public a body of fact
and informed opinion on many important issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal and Appellate Committees in which
the bulk of the House’s judicial work is transacted, there are two major select
committees with several sub-committees on the European Communities and on
Science and Technology. There are also select committees on House of Lords’
Offices, Hybrid Instruments, Leave of Absence and Lords’ Expenses, Personal
Bills, Private Bills, Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure, Selection and
Broadcasting.
Joint committees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation
Bills and delegated legislation. The two Houses may also agree to set up joint
select committees on other subjects. A joint committee was appointed in 1987 to
examine private Bill procedure.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
unofficial party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members’ Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of the back-bench mem¬
bership of the party in the House of Commons. When the Conservative Party is
in office, ministers attend its meetings by invitation and not by right, but when
GOVERNMENT
45
the party is in opposition, the whole membership of the party may attend
meetings and the leader appoints a consultative committee which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet’. The Parliamentary Labour Party is a corporate body
comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when the Labour Party is in
office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communication between the
Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when the party is in
opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under the direction of
an elected Parliamentary Committee which acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of The effectiveness of parliamentary control of the Government is a subject of
Parliamentary continuing discussion, both inside and outside Parliament. Control is exercised
Control finally by the ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or, ultimately, by refusing to vote the money required for the public
service. In addition to the system of close scrutiny by select committees, the
House of Commons offers a number of opportunities for a searching examin¬
ation of government policy by both the Opposition and the Government's own
back-benchers.
These include:
1. Question time when for an hour on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’ questions. The Prime Minister’s question
time takes place on Tuesday and Thursday. Parliamentary questions are one
means of eliciting information about the Government’s intentions, as well as a
way of airing, and possibly securing redress of, grievances brought to MPs’
notice by constituents. MPs may also put questions to ministers for written
answers, which are published in Hansard, the official report. At the daily
question time in the House of Lords questions are addressed to the
Government rather than to a particular minister.
2. The right of MPs to use motions for the adjournment of the House to open
discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end of the business of the day; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and summer), a full day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, an MP wishing to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, the MP asks the House for leave for the motion to be
put forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or it can be given if 40 or more
MPs support the motion or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is
debated for three hours, usually on the next day.
3. The 20 Opposition days each session when the Opposition can choose
subjects for debate.
4. Debates on the occasion of the passage, three times a year, of Consolidated
Fund or Appropriation Bills, when members can exercise their traditional
right of‘raising grievances’, on matters for which any minister is responsible,
when voting the necessary supplies (money) for the Crown.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during the
debate on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of a session, during debates or
motions of censure for which the Government gives up part of its own time, and
during debates on the Government's legislative proposals.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Opportunities for criticism and examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily question time, during debates on specific
motions and in ‘unstarred' questions (which can be debated) at the end of the
day’s business as well as during debates on specific legislative proposals.
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and more particularly of the House of
Commons, in managing the revenue of the State and payments for the public
service are to authorise the taxes and duties to be levied and the various objects
of expenditure and the sum to be spent on each. It also has to satisfy itself that
the sums granted are spent only for the purposes which Parliament intended. No
payment out of the central Government's public funds can be made and no
taxation, charges or loans authorised, except by Act of Parliament, although
interim payments can be made, within limits, from the Contingencies Fund.
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out by House of Commons Select
Committees (see p 44).
To keep the two Houses informed of European Community developments, and
to enable them to scrutinise and debate Community policies and proposals,
there is a select committee in each House (see p 44), and ministers make regular
statements about Community business.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman ) investigates, independently, complaints of maladministration
when asked to do so by MPs on behalf of members of the public. Powers of
investigation extend to administrative actions by central government depart¬
ments and certain executive and non-departmental bodies but not to policy
decisions (which can be questioned in Parliament) nor to matters affecting
relations with other countries. Complaints by British citizens arising from
dealings with British posts overseas are open to investigation in some
circumstances. The Commissioner has access to departmental papers and
reports the findings to the MP who presented the complaint. The Commissioner
is required to report annually to Parliament. In addition, he or she publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly intervals and may submit other
reports where necessary. A Commons select committee has responsibility for
overseeing the Commissioner’s work.
Each House of Parliament has certain rights and immunities to protect it from
unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. The rights apply collectively
to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims ‘their ancient and undoubted
rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in civil actions; exemption from serving
on juries, attending as witnesses or serving as sheriffs; and the right of access to
the Crown, a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges include the
rights of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance,
to exclude ‘strangers’ if it wishes), to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for
membership and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to penalise for
breach of its privileges and for contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords are broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons.
The Privy Council
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was the
chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent. Many
powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner committee of the Council,
GOVERNMENT
47
Committees of
the Privy
Council
Composition
Prime Minister
and much of its work was handed over to newly created government depart¬
ments, some of which were originally committees of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy Council is to advise the Queen to
approve Orders in Council (those made under prerogative powers, such as
Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorporation; and those made
under statutory powers). Members of the Privy Council attending meetings at
which Orders are made do not thereby become personally responsible for the
policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests with the minister responsible
for the subject matter of the Order in question, whether or not he or she was
present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament). The Council’s own statutory responsi¬
bilities, which are independent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council,
include powers of supervision over the registering bodies for the medical and
allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn
in on first assuming office, membership of the Council (retained for life except
for very occasional removals) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommenda¬
tion of the Prime Minister to eminent people in independent monarchical
countries of the Commonwealth. There are about 390 Privy Counsellors. A full
Council is summoned only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign
announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of advisory Privy Council committees whose meetings differ
from those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot consti¬
tutionally be present. These may be prerogative committees, such as those
dealing with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man and with applications for charters of incorporation;
or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not discontinued the appeal, courts
of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other courts, some
professional and disciplinary committees and ecclesiastical sources.
Administrative work is carried out in the Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the Commons, although the
Government is also fully represented by ministers in the Lords. The Lord
Chancellor is always a member of the House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary both in the number of ministers and
in the titles of some offices. New ministerial offices may be created, others may
be abolished, and functions may be transferred from one minister to another.
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition. First Lord of the Treasury and Minister
for the Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime

Minister during the eighteenth century. The Prime Minister's unique position of
authority derives from majority support in Parliament and from the power to
choose ministers and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
modern convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister informs the Queen of the general business of the
Government, presides over the Cabinet, and is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include recommending to the
Queen a number of appointments. These include: Church of England
archbishops, bishops and deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown ‘livings';
high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
and the Lords Justices of Appeal; Privy Counsellors, Lord-Lieutenants and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner to the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and
some university posts; and appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as various
royal and statutory commissions. Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions and of Civil List pensions (to
people who have achieved eminence in science and the arts and are in some
financial need). The Prime Minister also selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10 Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants who attend to the day-to-day
discharge of the Prime Minister's numerous responsibilities. The Prime Minister
may also appoint special advisers to the Office from time to time to assist in the
formation of policies.
Ministers in charge of government departments, who are usually in the Cabinet,
are known as ‘Secretary of State' or 'Minister', or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The holders of various traditional offices, namely the Lord President of the
Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Lord Privy Seal, the
Paymaster General and, from time to time. Ministers without Portfolio, may
have few or no departmental duties and are thus available to perform any special
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give them. In the present Government the
Lord President of the Council, for example, co-ordinates the presentation of
information on government policies and the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is Minister of Trade and Industry in the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a minister with departmen¬
tal functions and also head of the judiciary. The four Law Officers of the Crown
are; for England and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General: for
Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State usually work with ministers in charge of departments with
responsibility for specific functions, and are sometimes given titles which reflect
these particular functions. More than one may work in a department. A Minister
of State may be given a seat in the Cabinet and paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State or, where
the senior minister is not a Secretary of State, simply Parliamentary Secretaries)
share in parliamentary and departmental duties. They may also be given

Meetings
responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific aspects of
the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and other
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips (see p 40).
The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range from £34,808 a year
(from January 1988) for junior ministers to £51,068 for Cabinet ministers. The
Prime Minister receives £62,698 and the Lord Chancellor (from October 1987)
£83,000.1
Ministers in the Commons, including the Prime Minister, receive a parliamen¬
tary salary of £16,911 a year (which is included in the above figures) in
recognition of their constituency responsibilities and are entitled to claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs (see p 37).2
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers chosen by the Prime Minister
and may include departmental and non-departmental ministers. Its origins can
be traced back to the informal conferences which the Sovereign held with
leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth
century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the
eighteenth century, and the development of organised political parties stimu¬
lated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of policies, the
supreme control of government and the co-ordination of government depart¬
ments. The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the
Cabinet is a group of party representatives, depending upon majority support in
the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are confidential. Its members
are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose information about
its proceedings; although after Cabinet papers have been in existence for 30
years they may be made available for inspection in the Public Record Office.
Diaries published by several former ministers have given the public an insight
into Cabinet procedures in recent times.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less often when Parliament is not sitting. To
keep the amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a
great deal of work is carried on through the committee system, which involves
the reference of issues either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc
committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the
Cabinet with recommendations for action. The present Cabinet has four
standing committees; a defence and overseas policy committee and an economic
strategy committee, both under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister; and a
home and social affairs committee and a legislation committee, both under the
chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council. Sub-committees of the
standing committees may be established. Membership and terms of reference of
all Cabinet committees are confidential.
Non-Cabinet ministers may be invited to attend meetings on matters affecting

as the parliamentary salary of £16,911; the Leader of the Opposition in the Lords also receives a

their departments, and may be members of Cabinet committees. The Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior officials of the Cabinet Office also attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Statistical
Office, the Management and Personnel Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business and operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the
highest level.
The Management and Personnel Office is responsible for the management and
organisation of the Civil Service and recruitment into it, training, efficiency,
personnel management and senior appointments. (To be reconstituted in late
1987 as the Office of the Minister for the Civil Service, with responsibilities for
duties and standards in the Civil Service and selection and development of civil
servants; its functions relating to financial management, manpower, pay and
financial conditions of service will be transferred to the Treasury.)
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and interpre¬
tation of the statistics needed for central economic and social policies and
management, such as the national accounts, balance of payments and the index
of industrial production, and co-ordinates the statistical work of other
departments.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing the
official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the preparation
of official histories of certain peacetime events.
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility which
ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers’ individual
responsibility to Parliament for their departments' work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility means that the Cabinet acts unani¬
mously even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree on a subject. The policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government as
a whole. Once the Government’s policy on a matter has been decided, each
minister is expected to support it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in Parliament on government policies involving
important issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his or her
department means that, as political head of that department, he or she is
answerable for all its acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any
defect of administration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy
which may be criticised in Parliament, whether personally responsible or not.
Since most ministers are members of the House of Commons, they must answer
questions and defend themselves against criticism in person. Departmental
ministers in the House of Lords are represented in the Commons by someone
qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they usually consult their
colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. A decision
by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
keeping government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
GOVERNMENT
51
Non-

Public Bodies
companies, and must order their affairs so that there is no conflict between
public duties and private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation, and
for advising ministers. They may, and frequently do, work with and through
local authorities, statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of government control.
A chahge of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by some organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (like the Department of
Employment) cover England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland.
Others, such as the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with
affairs in England.
Some departments, such as the Department of Trade and Industry, maintain
a regional organisation, and some which have direct contact with the public
throughout the country (for example, the Department of Employment) also have
local offices.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent official, and
a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For instance,
ministers in the Treasury are responsible for the Central Office of Information,
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, HM Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue
and a number of small departments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Depart¬
ment, the Royal Mint, and the National Investment and Loans Office. Depart¬
ments generally receive their funds directly out of money provided by Parliament
and are staffed by the Civil Service.
A number of bodies with a role in the process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a department (in April 1986 the figure was
1,658). Known as non-departmental public bodies, but often popularly
described as ‘quangos’ (‘quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations’,
although there is no precise definition of the term), they are of three kinds:
executive bodies, advisory bodies and tribunals. Executive bodies normally
employ staff and have their own budget: they consist of public bodies which
carry out, among other duties, administrative, executive, regulatory and
commercial functions. They operate typically within broad policy guidelines set
by departmental ministers but are in varying degrees independent of govern¬
ment in carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities. Examples include the Arts
Council of Great Britain, the British Council, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation and the Commission for Racial Equality. Tribunals are a special¬
ised group of judicial bodies which are akin to courts of law. They are normally
set up under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions
and procedure. Tribunals often consist of laymen, but generally have a legally
qualified chairman. They tend to be less expensive, and less formal, than courts
of law. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and
obligations of private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. Important examples are industrial
tribunals, rent tribunals and social security tribunals. Tribunals usually consist
of an uneven number of people so that a majority decision can be reached.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject.
Tribunals and advisory bodies do not normally employ staff or spend money
52

themselves, but their expenses are paid by government departments concerned;
a note on advisory bodies is set out below.
As a result of a major review of non-departmental public bodies undertaken in
1979 and subsequent further reviews there has been a net reduction of 509 in
the total number of bodies. Scrutiny of these bodies continues with a view to
improving performance and value for money.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
which undertake research and collect information, mainly to give ministers
access to informed opinion before coming to a decision involving a legislative or
executive act. In some cases a minister must consult a standing committee, but
usually advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according to
the nature of the work involved, and will usually include representatives of
varying interests and professions.
In addition to the standing advisory bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine and make recommendations on specific matters. For
certain important inquiries Royal Commissions, whose members are chosen for
their wide experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government departments,
interested organisations and individuals, and submit recommendations. The
Government may accept the recommendations in whole or in part, or may decide
to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be undertaken by
departmental committees.
Government Each of the main government departments has its own information division or
Information directorate, public relations branch or news department staffed by professional
Services information officers responsible for communicating their department’s policies
and activities to the news media and the public (sometimes using publicity
services provided by the Central Office of Information—see p 54) and for
advising their department on the public’s reaction to them. The presentation of
government policy is co-ordinated, at official level, by the Prime Minister s Press
Secretary. As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office have direct and constant contact with
the parliamentary press through regular meetings with the Lobby correspon¬
dents (a group of political correspondents who have the special privilege of
access to the Lobby of the House of Commons where they can talk privately to
government ministers and other members of the House) and other day-to-day
contacts. The Prime Minister’s Press Office forms the accepted channel through
which information about parliamentary business is conveyed to the media.
Distribution of An outline of the principal functions of the main government departments is
Functions given below. Departments are arranged in alphabetical order, except for the
Scottish and Northern Ireland departments which are grouped at the end of the
section and the Cabinet Office, which was described on p 50. Further

SCOTLAND Scotland has its own system of law and wide administrative autonomy. The
Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has responsibility in
Scotland (with some exceptions) for both formulating and carrying out policy
relating to agriculture and fisheries, education, law and order, local government
and environmental services, social work, health, housing, roads and certain
aspects of shipping and road transport services.
56
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and development
of the Scottish economy, and important functions relating to industrial
development, with responsibility for financial assistance to industry, for the
Scottish Development-Agency, and the Highlands and Islands Development
Board, the Scottish Tourist Board and for the work of the Manpower Services
Commission and the Careers Service. The Secretary of State plays a full part in
determining energy policy, particularly in relation to responsibility for the
electricity supply industry in Scotland. He is also responsible for the government
interest in a range of other functions from fire services to sport.
The distinctive features and the different conditions and needs of Scotland
and its people are reflected in separate Scottish legislation on many domestic
matters or else in special provisions applying to Scotland alone, inserted in Acts
which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Secretary of State discharges his responsibilities principally through the
Scottish Office’s five departments, supported by Central Services (see below) and
four smaller departments—the Department of the Registers of Scotland, the
Scottish Record Office, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Scottish
Courts Administration.
United Kingdom government departments with significant Scottish responsi¬
bilities have offices in Scotland with delegated powers and work closely with the
Scottish Office.

Departments
NORTHERN Between 1921 and 1972 Northern Ireland had its own Parliament and
IRELAND Government, subordinate to the Parliament at Westminster, but in 1972,
following the resignation of the Northern Ireland Government, the British
Government assumed direct responsibility with a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister responsible for functions previously exercised by the Northern Ireland
Government. Attempts have been made by successive governments to find a
means of restoring devolved government to Northern Ireland on a basis that
would cornrnand widespread acceptance throughout the community. The most
recent attempt failed in June 1986 when the Northern Ireland Assembly, elected
in 1982, was dissolved after it ceased to discharge its responsibilities of making
proposals for the resumption of devolved government and of monitoring the
work of the Northern Ireland departments. The Government expressed the hope
that a new Assembly would be established which would contribute to the better
government and administration of Northern Ireland.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is the Cabinet minister responsible
for Northern Ireland. Through the Northern Ireland Office he has direct
responsibility for constitutional developments, law and order and security, and
electoral matters. The work of the Northern Ireland departments, whose
functions are listed below, are also subject to the direction and control of the
Secretary of State.

The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the conduct of the whole range of
government activities as they affect the community, ranging from policy
formulation to carrying out the day-to-day duties that public administration
demands.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown. They are responsible to the minister
in whose department they work for carrying out his or her policies. Ministers
alone are answerable to Parliament for their policies and the actions of their staff
(though civil servants may give evidence to parliamentary select committees on
their minister’s behalf). In the determination of policy the civil servant has no
constitutional responsibility or role distinct from that of the minister. A change
of minister, for whatever reason, does not involve a change of staff. (Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from outside the Civil Service; the advisers
are paid from public funds, but their appointments come to an end when the
Government’s term of office finishes, or when the Minister to whom the special
adviser is appointed leaves the Government or moves to another appointment.)
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent
to one full-time), in January 1987 there were around 599,000 civil servants
(nearly half of them women), roughly half of whom were engaged in the provision
of public services, such as paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting
taxes and contributions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and
providing services to industry and agriculture. Over a quarter were employed in
the Ministry of Defence. The rest were divided between: central administrative
and policy duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation,
printing and information; and largely financially self-supporting services, for
instance, those provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal
Mint.
The total number includes about 93,000 ‘industrial’ civil servants, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments.
Over three-quarters of civil servants work outside London. The number of civil
servants has fallen from 732,000 in April 1979 to 599,000 in January 1987,
reflecting the Government’s policy of controlling the cost and size of the Civil

Service and to improve its efficiency. It is planned to achieve a further reduction
to 594,000 by April 1988 from which date the primary consideration when
employing further staff will be whether it is consistent with the limits set on
running costs.
Within the Civil Service reforms of all aspects of the management of
government departments are being implemented to ensure improved manage¬
ment performance, in particular through the sharper accountability of indi¬
vidual managers based on clear objectives and responsibilities. These reforms
include an experimental performance-related pay scheme, and other means to
encourage and reward improved performance.
Savings are also being sought by subjecting services in government depart¬
ments to competitive tendering and by contracting out such services whenever
commensurate with sound management and good value for money. By April
1986 savings of £22 million net a year had been achieved.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service and Civil Service Commission,
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain.
Responsibility for central co-ordination and management of the Civil Service is
divided between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office (Management and
Personnel Office). In addition to its other functions, the Treasury is responsible
for controlling Civil Service manpower, pay, pensions and allowances, while the
Management and Personnel Office, which is part of the Cabinet Office and under
the control of the Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, is responsible
for the organisation, structure, personnel management and overall efficiency of
the Service. The function of official Head of the Home Civil Service is combined
with that of Secretary to the Cabinet. At the senior levels of the Home Civil
Service there is an open structure of unified grades which, with few exceptions,
covers all posts whatever the nature of their duties. Grades 1, 2 and 3 replace the
former grade titles of Permanent Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Under¬
secretary while Grades 4, 5, 6 and 7 cover the senior levels of most occupational
groups and classes down to Principal, Principal Scientific Officer, Principal
Professional and Technology Officer and equivalent levels.
Below this the structure of the non-industrial Civil Service is based on a
system of categories and occupational groups, which are the basic groupings of
staff for the purposes of recruitment, pay and personnel management. These
include the General Category (covering the Administration, Economist, Statis¬
tician, Information Officer and Librarian groups), the Science Category, the
Professional and Technology Category (including architects, surveyors, electri¬
cal and mechanical engineers, graphics officers and marine services staff), and
the Training Category (covering Instructional Officers) and the Legal, Police,
Secretarial, Research Officer, Social Security, Security and Museum Categories.
These 11 categories account for some 75 per cent of non-industrial staff. Work
requiring specialist skill is always done by appropriately qualified individuals.
Personnel management policies encourage the deployment of staff so that
talent can be used to the best advantage, and, with higher posts open to people
of outstanding ability (whatever their specialist background or original method
of entry into the Service), ensure that people with the necessary qualities can
gain suitably wide experience to fit them for posts at the highest levels. The
exchange of staff between the Civil Service and industry is also encouraged.
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of some 4,600 or so people, provides
the majority of the staff for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United
Kingdom diplomatic missions and consular posts abroad. Its functions include
advising on policy, negotiating with overseas governments and conducting
business in international organisations; promoting British exports and trade

generally, administering aid, presenting ideas, policies and objectives to the
people of overseas countries; and protecting British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service, and conditions of work are in many ways comparable
while taking into account the special demands of the Service, particularly of
postings overseas. Members of the Home Civil Service and the armed forces, and
individuals from the private sector, may also serve in the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Recruitment of staff to the middle and higher levels of the Home Civil Service
and the Diplomatic Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission
which, in conjunction with departments, ensures that staff are selected solely on
merit through fair and open competition. The selection of junior staff, such as
those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken by the departments.
For the Administration Group, the central part of the Home and Diplomatic
Civil Services, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic
achievements of: a second class honours degree, or better; GCE Advanced level;
and GCE Ordinary level. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by tests
and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an interview by the Final
Selection Board. For the next level (the Executive Officer entry) selection involves
qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the lower level (the clerical entry)
selection is normally by interview of those holding the prescribed educational
qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.
Most government departments employ full-time training officers and tutors to
help to identify staff training needs and to organise training by the most
appropriate methods (for example, formal courses or self-instruction). The Civil
Service College provides training most efficiently undertaken centrally. Use is
also made of external institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may continue their education by attending
courses usually for one day a week ( day release’ schemes). Adult staff may be
entitled to financial assistance to undertake, mainly in their own time, private
studies leading to recognised educational or professional qualifications in
approved subjects. There are also opportunities for civil servants to obtain
fellowships for research in areas of interest both to themselves and to their
departments.
Departments are responsible for promotion at all grade levels. Normally
promotion is from grade to grade, but there can be accelerated promotion for
staff who show exceptional promise. Promotion or appointment to Grades 1 and
2 and all transfers between departments at these levels are approved by the
Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head of the Home Civil Service.
Terms of service for civil servants are generally governed by agreements
between senior officials (the Official Side of the National Whitley Council) and
representatives of the employees (the Trade Union Side of the National Whitley
Council). For industrial civil servants, the negotiating body is the Joint
Co-ordinating Committee of government industrial establishments.
Civil servants are required to discharge loyally the duties assigned to them by
the Government of the day of whatever political persuasion. For the Civil Service
to serve successive governments of different political complexions it is essential
that ministers and the public should have confidence that civil servants'
personal views do not cut across the discharge of their official duties. The
GOVERNMENT
61
Security
purpose of the rules which govern political activities by civil servants is to allow
them the greatest possible freedom to participate in public affairs without
infringing these fundamental principles. The rules are concerned with political
activities liable to give public expression to political views, rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in political activities. The ‘politically
free’ group, consisting of industrial staff and non-office grades, are free to
engage in any political activity including adoption as a candidate for the United
Kingdom or the European Parliament (although they would have to resign from
the Service if elected). The politically restricted’ group, which comprises
Principal and equivalent grades and above as well as Administration Trainees,
are debarred from national political activities but may apply for permission to
take part in local political activities. The ‘intermediate’ group, which comprises
all civil servants not in either of the other two groups, may apply for permission
to take part in national or local political activity, apart from candidature for the
United Kingdom or the European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the
avoidance of any conflict with official duties. (It is granted subject to a code of
discretion requiring moderation and the avoidance of embarrassment to
ministers.)
Generally, there are no restrictions on the private activities of civil servants,
provided that these do not bring discredit on the Civil Service, and that there is
no possibility of conflict with official duties. For instance, a civil servant is
required to seek permission before taking part in any outside activity which
involves the use of official experience, or before accepting a directorship in any
company holding a contract with his or her department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern. However, no one whose loyalty is in doubt may be employed on work
vital to the security of the State. For this reason certain posts are not open to
those who are known to be members of communist or fascist organisations or of
subversive groups, or associated with them in such a way as to raise legitimate
doubts about their reliability, or to anyone whose reliability may be in doubt for
any other reason.
Each department is responsible for its own internal security, advised as
necessary by the Security Service. The Security Commission, if requested to do
so by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition,
may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure.
Local Government
A wide range of public services is provided by democratically elected local
authorities throughout the United Kingdom. The gradual expansion of local
services, particularly in the period between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, has
inevitably led to a steady rise in local government expenditure and in its support
from central funds. In recent years central government has sought to check this
growth as part of a general policy of reducing public expenditure. Measures
introduced to promote greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness have included
the holding back of central government grant from authorities spending above
government targets, the prescription of maximum levels of spending and rates
for selected high-spending authorities in England and the establishment in
England and Wafles of the independent Audit Commission to audit accounts and
62
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Principal Types

Authority
seek economical use of resources. Legislation is proposed to promote greater
competition in the provision of some local authority services. In Scotland there
is an independent Commission for Local Authority Accounts and similar action
has been taken to control local authority expenditure. Moreover, since staff costs
form such a significant part of public expenditure, local authorities have been
urged to reduce staff levels. Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland are
now required to publish quarterly staffing levels for particular services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Parliament, or by measures made under its authority. The actual adminis¬
tration, and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are the responsi¬
bility of the local authority. In the case of certain services, however, ministers
have powers to secure a measure of national uniformity in the standard of a
service provided, to safeguard public health, or to protect the rights of individual
citizens. For some services the minister concerned has wide powers of
supervision; for others there are strictly limited powers.
The main links between local authorities and the central government are: in
England, the Department of the Environment, although other departments are
concerned with various local government functions; in Scotland, the Scottish
Office; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland, the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland.
England and Wales (outside Greater London) are divided into 53 counties,
within which there are 369 districts. All the districts and 47 of the counties—the
‘non-metropolitan’ counties—have independent, locally elected councils with
separate functions. County authorities provide the large-scale local government
services, while the district authorities are responsible for the more local ones
(see p 64).
In Greater London (an area of about 1,580 sq km (610 sq miles) and a
population of some 7 million) the local government authorities are the councils
of 32 London boroughs and the Corporation of London, while in the six
metropolitan counties there are 36 district councils.
Until April 1986 Greater London and the metropolitan counties had their own
councils but these were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985, which was
designed to create a more effective, economical and accountable system by
removing a tier of local government. As a result many of the functions previously
carried out by the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils
have been transferred to the London borough and metropolitan district
councils. However, a number of services (waste regulation and disposal in
certain areas; the police and fire services, including civil defence, and public
transport in all metropolitan counties; and the fire service, including civil
defence, in London) which require a statutory authority over areas wider than
the boroughs and districts are now run by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or district councils. Education in inner
London is the responsibility of a new, independent and directly elected
authority. As a direct result of abolition, it is expected that some 7,000 posts will
eventually be shed, producing an estimated saving of about £100 million a
year.
Special residuary bodies have been appointed to take responsibility for certain
residual county council and Greater London Council matters. These include
compensation, unassigned legal rights and liabilities, and the disposal of
surplus property. The residuary bodies are required to prepare proposals to
wind up their affairs as soon as practicable.
Within rural districts in England, parish councils or meetings are focuses for
local opinion as bodies with limited powers of local interest. In Wales community
councils have similar functions.
GOVERNMENT
63
Election of
Councils
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is also made for local community councils, although
these are not local authorities.
The areas and electoral arrangements of local authorities are kept under
review by the Local Government Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are responsible for local environmen¬
tal and certain other services. Statutory bodies, such as the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive and area boards, are responsible to central government
departments for the administration of major services such as housing,
education and libraries, and health and personal social services. Regional
services such as roads, water and sewerage, and planning, are the responsibility
of central government, through the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. Councillors can claim a flat-rate attendance
allowance or a financial loss allowance for performing council business: they are
also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim expenses for duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority (in Northern Ireland by the
Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the chairman is normally known as
the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other large cities, he or she is
known as the Lord Mayor). In Scotland the chairman of the district council of
each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No specific title is laid down for
the chairmen of other councils, but some are known as conveners, while others
continue to use the old title of provost’.
Councillors are elected for four years. All county councils, London borough
councils, and about two-thirds of non-metropolitan district councils are elected
in their entirety every four years. In the remaining districts (including all
metropolitan districts) one-third of the councillors are elected in each of the
three years between county council elections.
In Scotland local elections are held every two years, alternately for districts and
for regions and islands authorities, so that all types of authority are elected for
four years at a time.
Anyone is entitled to vote at a local government election in Great Britain
provided he or she is aged 18 years or over, is a British citizen, other
Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not subject to any
legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for the area for
which the election is held. To qualify for registration a person must be resident
in the council area on the qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
A candidate for election as councillor normally stands as a representative of
one of the national political parties, or of some local interest, or as an
independent. Candidates must be British citizens, other Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In addition, they
must be registered as local electors in the area of the local authority to which
they seek election: or have resided in or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or
other premises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day
on which they are nominated as candidates or, in that 12 months, have had
their principal or only place of work there. No one may be elected to a council of

which he or she is an employee, and there are some other disqualifications.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local council
elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided into
electoral divisions. Districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided
into electoral ‘wards’, returning one councillor or more. In Scotland the electoral
areas in the regions and islands areas are called electoral divisions, each
returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or community, or ward of a parish or
community, forms an electoral area which returns one member or more.
The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar to that
for parliamentary elections. Postal voting for such elections was introduced in
1987. In Northern Ireland local government elections are held on the basis of
proportional representation and electoral wards are grouped into district
electoral areas.
Local authorities’ functions are far-reaching. Some are primarily duties, others
purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between county
and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible for
matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring the
support of substantial resources while district councils as a whole administer
functions of more local significance.
English county councils are generally responsible for strategic planning,
transport planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer protection, refuse
disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the personal social
services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan areas and of
district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are responsible, for
instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most planning
applications, and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street car parks
subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to carry out some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In the metropolitan counties the district councils are responsible for the full
range of services (apart from the police, the fire service and public transport and,
in some areas only, waste regulation and disposal—see p 62). In Greater London
the boroughs and the City Corporation are responsible for a similar range of
functions but London's metropolitan police force is directly responsible to the
Home Secretary. Responsibility for passenger transport lies with London
Regional Transport and in inner London, education is administered by the
Inner London Education Authority.-Responsibility for land drainage and flood
protection, including the Thames Barrier, rests with the Thames Water
Authority.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non¬
metropolitan areas of England.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for any of their functions
to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority, other than functions
relating to education, police, the personal social services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales.
Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because of their isolation from the
mainland, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland local environmental and certain other services, such as
leisure and the arts, are administered by the district councils. Responsibility for

planning, roads, water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district
through a divisional office of the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Area boards, responsible to central departments, administer locally
education, public libraries and the health and personal social services. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive, responsible to the Department of the
Environment, administers housing.
Local authorities have considerable freedom to make arrangements for carrying
out their duties. They may co-operate or share among themselves the discharge
of their functions. Most use a committee system, whereby policy and principle
are decided in full council, and the various services are administered by
committees composed of selected members of the council and, where the
authority so chooses, ‘persons of experience’. A council may delegate to a
committee or officer any of its functions except those in connection with raising
loans, levying rates (see p 67) or making financial demands on other local
authorities liable to contribute; these are legally reserved to the council as a
whole. Some councils have policy advisory or co-ordinating committees which
originate policy for implementation by the full council. The powers and duties of
local authority committees (which may be advisory or executive) are usually laid
down in formal standing orders. Parish and community councils in England
and Wales are often able to do their work in full session although they appoint
committees from time to time as necessary. An independent inquiry into the
conduct of business in local authorities in Great Britain was completed in June
1986; the Government is considering its proposals.
The public (including the press) are admitted to council, committee and
sub-committee meetings, and have a right of access to agenda, reports and
minutes of meetings and certain background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances specified by legislation.
Nearly 3 million people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and technical staff, teachers, firemen,
those engaged on law and order services, and manual workers. Nearly half of all
local government workers are employed in the education service.
Although a few appointments must be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size, composition and
deployment of their workforces. In Northern Ireland each council must by law
appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers; administrative, professional, clerical and technical staff; and manual
workers. Senior staff appointments are usually made on the recommendation of
the committee or committees particularly concerned; most junior appointments
are made by heads of departments, who are also responsible for engaging
manual workers. Appointments and engagements always conform to the
council's set establishment, and committees are informed of appointments
which they have not made themselves.
Pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are generally a matter for
each council, although there are scales recommended by national negotiating
machinery set up by the local authorities themselves.
Authorities differ in the degree to which they employ staff to carry out certain
functions (for example, building work, street cleaning or refuse collection) or use
private firms under contract. The Government’s policy of promoting value for
money is encouraging the use of private firms where there are resultant

Expenditure
economies, and legislation is before Parliament to require authorities to open up
further services to competition from the private sector. In the specific case of
building and maintenance work, the Local Government, Planning and Land Act
1980 obliges authorities' direct labour organisations to bid for such work in
open competition if they wish to undertake it.
In 1986—87 expenditure by local authorities in the United Kingdom was some
£38,700 million, about one-quarter of total public expenditure. Current
expenditure amounted to some £34,500 million, and capital expenditure to
about £4,200 million. Education accounts for over one-third of the total. Most of
the remainder is spent on law and order, housing and other environmental
services, personal social services and transport.
Local authority current expenditure in England and Wales is financed by a
combination of central government grants and local rates (a tax based on
property values). A few services such as the police, housing and transport and
the urban programme for inner city areas receive specific central government
grants towards their cost. However, most central government support for
current spending is provided through the rate support grant. This has two
elements, domestic rate relief grant, which is paid to rating authorities as a
direct subsidy to domestic rates, and block grant. Block grant is a general grant
which is designed to compensate for variations in the needs which local
authorities have to provide for and for differences in the resources they may be
able to raise in local rates. Each local authority’s grant is, therefore, calculated to
be sufficient for it to provide a similar level of service to that of other authorities
while at the same time charging the same rate level. This system requires an
assessment of each authority’s need to provide services which takes account
of a large number of factors and characteristics of an authority's area and
population.
Within this system, local authorities are free to decide on their overall level of
spending and on their priorities between particular services. However, because
of the need to control public expenditure, the method for calculating an
authority’s entitlement to block grant provides that for almost all authorities,
grant entitlement decreases as expenditure increases, thus giving an incentive
for expenditure restraint. The previous system of setting expenditure targets for
each authority has now been discontinued. The Government has power, subject
to parliamentary approval, to fix upper limits on the rates of selected authorities
whose spending it considers to be excessive. In 1987—88, 20 English authorities
had an upper limit set on their rate levies, and 20 of the new authorities set up
after the abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county
councils have an upper limit on their precepts.
In Scotland the grant is distributed in three parts: the ‘needs’ element,
designed to give most help to authorities whose spending needs are greatest: the
‘resources’ element, used to supplement the rate income of authorities whose
rateable value per head of population falls below a standard figure, prescribed for
each year; and the ‘domestic’ element, which compensates authorities for loss of
rate income from reductions in rate poundage which they are required to give to
householders. Local authorities are free to decide on their level of spending, but
central government can make selective grant and rate reductions in the case of
individual authorities planning excessive and unreasonable expenditure. Cur¬
rent expenditure guidelines are issued and the grant payable to authorities is
reduced where the level of expenditure planned by authorities is in excess of the
guidelines. The Government has power to set a general limitation on rates.
In Northern Ireland district councils receive central government grants
comprising specific grants which assist with the financing of certain functions

Capital
Expenditure
Rates
(for example, the acquisition of open space, and the provision of clean air) and
certain capital projects (for example, leisure centres), and a general grant, which
is paid by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. The general
grant compensates councils for loss of rate income arising from statutory
derating of premises; it also contains a resources element which brings the
rating resources of poorer councils up to a standard level determined by the
Department.
Local government capital expenditure is financed primarily by borrowed money
which is supplemented by capital grants and other income, especially receipts
from property sales. By far the most significant service is housing which in
1986—87 accounted for 50 per cent of gross expenditure. Every year each local
authority receives from the Government a capital expenditure allocation for each
of the main blocks of services for which it is responsible. An authority may in
any year borrow amounts of money broadly equal to the total of the allocations it
has received. Allocations may be supplemented by a proportion of the capital
receipts generated by the authority. With other minor additions, this consti¬
tutes a ceiling on the total of most types of capital expenditure which the
authority may undertake in that year. Authorities have almost complete
discretion, within their legal powers, to spend according to locally determined
priorities.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the
rateable value of a property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value) by the
rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the authority
according to its projected financial needs. Rateable values are assessed
periodically, and there is a system of appeals for disputed assessments. Crown
(government) property is not rateable but payments are made, based on values
assessed by the Treasury Valuer, in place of rates.
Government grants reduce domestic rates below the levels paid by commercial
concerns. Rating relief is available in certain circumstances on premises
adapted for the use of the disabled. Agricultural land and buildings (apart from
living accommodation and farm shops) and places of religious worship are
exempted from rates. Charities pay half the full rate on premises occupied for
charitable purposes and may be given further relief by rating authorities, who
can also reduce or remit the rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies.
In England and Wales rating authorities have the discretion to levy a rate on
property unoccupied for more than three months. For non-domestic property
this is limited to 50 per cent of the full rate, with complete exemption for empty
warehouses and industrial property. In enterprise zones, which have been set
up in certain areas to foster industrial and commercial regeneration, commer¬
cial and industrial properties are exempted from paying rates for ten years.
In Scotland industrial (including freight transport) premises are rated at 60
per cent of net annual value. Most empty properties pay no rates.
Proposals for the reform of local authority finance in Great Britain, which are
designed to strengthen local democratic accountability, were announced in
1986. The main features are a national non-domestic rate, the proceeds of which
would be distributed to local authorities in proportion to the number of adults;
the replacement of domestic rates by a community charge which each authority
would set and which would be payable by every resident adult; and a grant
system that would compensate for differences in local authorities’ needs and
would provide additional help by way of a fixed sum per adult. The new system is
to begin to be introduced in Scotland in April 1989 and is expected to begin to

come into effect in England and Wales in 1990 to coincide with a revaluation of
non-domestic properties.
In Northern Ireland all industrial premises are fully derated as are commercial
premises in enterprise zones. Certain other properties, such as freight transport
and recreational premises, are partially derated.
Local authorities are allowed to borrow money long term to finance new capital
expenditure and also to refinance loans raised for capital finance thus enabling
flexible debt management. Authorities are not permitted to borrow long term to
finance revenue expenditure but they may borrow money short term in
anticipation of revenues receivable. In Northern Ireland long-term borrowing by
district councils is subject to central approval; in Scotland central approval is
given to capital expenditure, not to loans.
Most long-term borrowing by authorities is from the Public Works Loan Board
(or, in Northern Ireland, the Consolidated Fund). The Board draws its funds
from the Government’s National Loans Fund and thus allows authorities to
enjoy interest rates lower than any institution except the Government.
Authorities may also borrow money by means of private mortgages, issuing
stock upon the Stock Exchange, issuing bonds which may or may not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange, and issuing bills. All loan charges are secured against
the revenues of the authority and represent a first charge on those revenues.
Local councils normally have a finance committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. They must have their annual accounts audited by
independent auditors appointed by the Audit Commission in England and
Wales, or by the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland this role is exercised by a local government audit section
appointed by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves
independent statutory Commissions for Local Administration comprising local
commissioners (local government Ombudsmen). The English Commission has
three local commissioners and the Welsh, one. In Scotland the statute provides
for a single commissioner. All commissioners are responsible in their particular
area for investigating citizens' allegations of injustice resulting from mal¬
administration by local authorities. In normal circumstances, the Commis¬
sioners can only initiate an investigation at the request of a local councillor.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils
and certain other public bodies.
Fire Services
Every part of the United Kingdom is covered by a local authority fire service,
which is subject to some general oversight by central government. Other than in
Northern Ireland, where the fire service is financed wholly from central
government funds, the cost is shared between local authorities and central
government, the latter contribution through the rate support grant.
Each of the 64 fire authorities must by law make provision for fire-fighting,
and maintain a brigade of sufficient strength to meet all normal requirements
(in some parts of Scotland combined authorities provide fire cover). Other
authorities also maintain fire brigades, for instance, the Army and Royal Air
Force Departments of the Ministry of Defence; the Civil Aviation Authority at
airports; and some large industrial and commercial concerns. These work in
co-operation with the local authority fire services.
GOVERNMENT
69
Fire Prevention
Research
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility in England and Wales and in Scotland respectively. Central
government is concerned mainly with ensuring the operational efficiency of
brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to prescribe standards and general
requirements on administrative and operational matters of service-wide signifi¬
cance. These include appointments and promotions, the provision of a central
training institution, pensions and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also
required for reductions in the fire-fighting establishments of fire brigades. Each
minister is advised by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, comprising the
respective home departments, local authorities, fire service representative
organisations and certain specialist advisers. In the home departments,
inspectorates of fire services advise on operational and technical matters. Most
fire brigades include part-time personnel who provide fire cover in less-densely
populated areas in return for a retaining fee and call-out and attendance fee. Fire
authorities also employ people for duties in controls, communications, and
mobilising and staff duties. There are about 39,000 full-time and 19,700
part-time operational members of fire brigades in Britain.
The standardisation of some equipment is encouraged, in order to assist
compatibility when a fire is attended by more than one brigade. The principal
types of fire-fighting appliances bought by fire authorities are based upon
specifications approved by the Secretaries of State and issued in the form of
advice by the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. The specifications aim to
describe the minimum standards required while allowing some freedom of
design.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
who exercises day-to-day control from brigade headquarters. Divisional officers
in charge of the geographical areas into which most brigade regions are divided
are responsible for mobilising forces. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and if additional resources are
required to deal with an incident, neighbouring divisions, or a neighbouring fire
brigade, are asked to provide assistance.
Fire authorities are concerned in some way with fire precautions in most
buildings used by the public and have major responsibility for enforcing
legislation concerning fire precautions. They must also make efficient arrange¬
ments for giving advice on fire prevention, restricting the spread of fires, and
means of escape. Courses in fire prevention are held at the Fire Service College
for fire brigade officers. In addition to their enforcement and advisory duties,
brigades are also involved in education and publicity to promote fire safety,
particularly in the home; the Home Office also promotes fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on prevention by the Joint Fire Prevention
Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils, representing the fire
service and central and local authorities.
Research into health hazards to fire-fighters, fire prevention, fire-brigade
organisation and fire-fighting equipment is conducted by the Home Office with
the help of the fire services under the auspices of the Joint Committee on
Fire Research of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual
research projects are undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Research and
Development Branch or, under contract to the Home Office, by other govern¬
ment agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, which is part of the Building
Research Establishment of the Department of the Environment, or by private
consultants. The Fire Research Station is the principal organisation studying
and investigating technical aspects of fire.

Special
Services
Fire Losses
Fire Casualties
Fire authorities have discretion to use their brigades and equipment in a variety
of non-fire emergencies. These are known as ‘special services’ and include rail,
road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of premises, leakage
of harmful gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals from dangerous
situations. Fire authorities are entitled to levy a charge for such services.
The direct cost of damage to buildings and goods destroyed by fires in Great
Britain in 1986 amounted to an estimated £455-5 million (consequential losses
from the interruption of business are not included in this total). Most fires
involving heavy losses occur when the premises are unattended; and fires are
more likely to start in storage areas than in production departments. Industries
which suffer most severely include engineering and electrical firms; textiles;
food, drink and tobacco warehousing; chemical and allied industries; paper,
printing and publishing firms; and retailing.
About 900 people, particularly the elderly and young children, die in fires every
year (most of them at home) and about a further 11,000 suffer injury. Among the
chief causes of fatal fires are ignition of upholstery, bedding and clothing by
smokers’ materials and by heaters.
3 Overseas
Relations
Britain's overseas relations reflect both its traditional position as a major
trading and maritime power whose people have settled throughout the world,
and its concern to help- to maintain peace and to secure world-wide economic
and social progress through international co-operation. It has diplomatic
relations with 165 countries, and with about 20 of these has common security
arrangements, principally through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Commercial activities have helped Britain to maintain its position as a world
financial centre. It has considerable overseas investments, imports over a third
of its food and more than half of its raw material requirements, and exports
account for over a quarter of its gross national product. Britain provides
development assistance to over 120 independent countries as well as to its
remaining dependencies.
In the belief that its overseas objectives can best be attained through
co-operation with other nations on a regional or global basis, Britain is a
member of some 120 international organisations ranging from the world-wide
United Nations concerned with problems of world peace, international economic
co-operation and social issues to regionally based and technically orientated
bodies. In particular, it is a member of the European Community and is
increasingly co-ordinating its overseas policies through the Community’s
political co-operation mechanism. As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain
is a part of a representative cross-section of the international community, which
has evolved from the British Empire (since 1945 Britain has progressively, and
largely peacefully, dismantled its Empire and prepared nearly 50 countries for
independence) and whose 49 members share a common language and close
professional, academic and commercial links.
Britain also has strong ties with the United States, including a common
language and similar political and cultural traditions.
A long involvement in world affairs has given Britain both a vital interest and a
firm belief in the maintenance of international order governed by respect for a
generally accepted system of law. As a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council it makes support for the United Nations a central feature of its
foreign policy.
Administration The general conduct of overseas relations is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs acting through the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and the 207 British diplomatic posts overseas. The latter
comprise embassies and high commissions in about 130 countries,1 together
with subordinate consulates-general and consulates, and missions at ten
international organisations. These posts, like the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, are staffed by members of the Diplomatic Service and locally engaged
people. Excluding supporting administrative and communications services, 30
per cent of front line diplomatic staff and senior locally engaged staff are involved
in commercial work such as export promotion and the protection of British
1 A few embassies are accredited to more than one country; for example, the embassy at Dakar in
Senegal is also accredited to Mauretania. Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Cape Verde.

Council
commercial interests, 25 per cent in consular/entry clearance services, 18 per
cent in political and economic work. 9 per cent in information and 7 per cent in
other work; 11 per cent are concerned with providing services for heads of posts.
Other departments which have a primary concern with overseas relations
include the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry, the
Treasury and the Overseas Development Administration (which is part of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office); but the involvement of most has increased
with the growing dependence of domestic economic policy on international
decisions and with Britain's membership of the European Community.
Where questions of overseas policy involve matters within the responsibility of
other departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formulates policy in
consultation with the departments concerned. The balance of responsibilities is
a matter of constant adjustment, and the department with the predominant
functional interest, even though it may be primarily domestic, takes the lead.
This is particularly so in policy concerning the European Community and
international monetary matters. In the case of policy towards the Community,
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office exercises its co-ordinating role at official
level through the machinery of the Cabinet Office.
Other bodies whose work has an overseas dimension include the British
Overseas Trade Board and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, which
provide export services for industry; the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments
and Administrations,1 which helps to arrange purchases from British aid funds
and appointments under technical co-operation programmes (as well as
providing mainly purchasing and management services to overseas govern¬
ments and institutions); and the British Council.
The British Council, established in 1934, aims to promote overseas an enduring
understanding and appreciation of Britain through cultural, educational and
technical co-operation. The activities of the Council, which has staff in over 80
countries, include the teaching of English and the recruitment of British
teachers for posts overseas; administering the Government’s educational
assistance and technical co-operation training programmes; fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific areas; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of
British books and periodicals overseas and providing information through
touring exhibitions and bibliographical services; and presenting overseas the
best of British arts and culture. In Britain, the Council is concerned mainly with
arranging programmes for professional visitors and with the placing, adminis¬
tration and welfare of overseas students. A basic principle is that the Council’s
work should be of benefit both to Britain and to the receiving country.
In 1986-87 the Council assisted 24,750 overseas students, trainees and
visitors to come to Britain, and an average of 56,000 students at any one time
were learning English in the Council and associated teaching centres overseas.
Book, audio-visual and periodical issues made by the Council’s 116 libraries
around the world totalled 7-1 million from a stock of 2 -1 million. In many places
the libraries are no longer just book collections but centres with film and video
stocks, software demonstration equipment and on-line access to British
databases. The Council handled over 700,000 inquiries about Britain. The
Council subsidises annually some 600 British drama, dance or music tours in
other countries.
About three-quarters of the Council’s funds, which amount to an estimated
£260 million in 1987-88, is provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office

dependent territories, the Crown Agents has been reorganised with a view to its privatisation in
due course.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
73
(including the Overseas Development Administration) and on its behalf the
Council is responsible for the implementation of more than 30 cultural
agreements with other countries. Overseas it acts as education adviser to
Britain's diplomatic missions and is responsible for educational assistance in
developing countries in which it is represented and for links and exchanges in
higher education which require official support. Increasingly, the Council is
undertaking education projects paid for by overseas clients and is providing
English classes abroad; it is estimated that these and other activities amounted
to nearly £50 million in 1986—87.
Membership of the European Community
Britain is a fully committed member of the European Community, an
association of 12 democratic nations which originated in the need for countries
in Western Europe to co-operate in the reconstruction of their ruined economies
at the end of the second world war and their desire to use this economic
co-operation to promote peace and freedom. In 1952 Belgium, France, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands estab¬
lished the European Coal and Steel Community to include their coal and steel
resources within a common market. This was followed by the Treaties of Rome,
signed in March 1957, setting up the European Economic Community and the
European Atomic Energy Community. Britain became a member in 1973,
together with Denmark and the Irish Republic; Greece followed in 1981 and
Portugal and Spain in 1986. The separate institutions established by the three
Community treaties were merged in 1967.
The Community’s aim, as set out in the Treaty of Rome, is to lay the
The European Community
74
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Community
Institutions
foundations for a closer union between the peoples of Europe on the basis of a
common internal market, the gradual approximation of member states'
economic policies and a framework of common law. The Community has
abolished internal tariffs and some other trade barriers, established a common
external customs tariff and made provision for freer movement of labour, capital
and services. The Community also negotiates on behalf of its member states in
international trade negotiations. Overseas countries having special links with
the Community are accorded preferential treatment in aid and the development
of trade. The Community accounts for about a fifth of world trade, and nearly
half of Britain's trade is with the other 11 member states.
Britain plays a constructive part in the development of the Community which
it regards as a means of strengthening democracy and reinforcing stability in
Europe and of increasing the collective strength of member states in interna¬
tional trade and other negotiations. In addition, it welcomes the member states’
commitment, enshrined by a treaty in 1986, to political co-operation on foreign
policy issues.
Under the treaties major policy decisions are taken by the Council of Ministers,
on which member states are represented by foreign or other ministers as
appropriate to the subject under discussion. The Presidency of the Council
changes at six-monthly intervals, Britain having assumed it for the third time
from July to December 1986. Most Council decisions are taken on the basis of a
proposal made by the European Commission; some may be decided by majority
or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to provisions set out in the
treaties. In other cases the Council proceeds on the basis of unanimity. In 1986
the Council agreed in the Single European Act to improve decision-taking
through more use of majority voting, particularly on internal market measures.
Heads of Government meet at least twice a year as the European Council,
which takes important decisions and discusses Community policies and world
affairs generally.
The European Commission puts forward policy proposals, executes decisions
taken by the Council of Ministers and ensures that Community rules are
correctly observed. It is composed of 17 Commissioners (two from Britain),
nominated by member governments and appointed by common agreement, and
is pledged to act independently of national or sectional interests.
The European Parliament, directly elected by the people in member states at
five-yearly intervals, has 518 members, 81 of whom come from Britain. Members
sit in eight main groups according to party affiliation and not nationality.
The Parliament is consulted on a wide range of issues before the Council takes
final decisions and these arrangements have been recently improved. The
Commission can be removed from office as a whole by a two-thirds majority of all
members of the Parliament in a vote of censure. The Parliament can also reject in
its entirety the draft annual budget as presented by the Commission and
approved by the Council. Members may also put questions to the Council of
Ministers and the Commission.
The European Court of Justice, consisting of 13 judges, interprets and
adjudicates on the meaning of the treaties and of any measures taken by the
Council of Ministers and the Commission; it also hears complaints and appeals
brought by or against Community institutions, member states or individuals
and gives preliminary rulings on cases referred to it by courts in the member
states. It represents the final authority on all aspects of Community law. The
Single European Act provides for a Court of First Instance to be attached to the
Court of Justice.
The European Court of Auditors examines all Community revenue and
expenditure to see that it has been legally received and spent, and to ensure

sound financial management. It draws up an annual report and may sub¬
mit observations on specific questions as the Community institutions
request.
Community policies are implemented by regulations, which are legally
binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives, which are
binding, as to the result to be achieved, on member states to which they are
addressed but allow national authorities to decide on means of implementation;
decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are addressed (for example,
member states, firms or individuals); and recommendations and opinions,
which have no binding force. The Council can also indicate a general policy
direction through resolutions.
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up
machinery under which they consult each other before taking up final positions
on important questions of foreign policy. Known as political co-operation,
these consultations include regular meetings of foreign ministers, monthly
meetings of senior officials, and contacts at working level among those con¬
cerned with particular questions. In addition, the 12 foreign ministries are
linked by a secure communications system and a small secretariat assists the
Presidency.
The Community is financed by a system of levies on agricultural imports,
customs duties and the product of a notional rate of value added tax (VAT) levied
on a Community harmonised basis at a rate at present not exceeding 1 -4 per
cent. These are known as ‘own resources’.
Without some form of adjustment Britain’s contributions under the system
would be much higher than its receipts from Community policies, because the
Common Agricultural Policy absorbs about two-thirds of Community spending
and Britain’s agricultural sector is relatively small. This problem was foreseen
during the accession negotiations, and Britain was given an assurance that, if
unacceptable situations arose, the very survival of the Community would
demand that its institutions found equitable solutions.
In 1980 the Community recognised that there was a problem for Britain, and
after a series of annual budgetary refunds the European Council reached an
agreement in June 1984 under which Britain obtains a rebate of 66 per cent of
the gap between its shares of VAT payments and of Community expenditure.
The VAT ceiling of 1 per cent was increased to 1 -4 per cent from 1986, partly to
meet the costs of enlargement of the Community. At the same time the Council
requested the Commission to produce a report on the results of budgetary
discipline, the Community’s financial needs and the breakdown of budgetary
costs among member states. The Commission put forward wide-ranging
proposals for the future financing of the Community in February 1987; these are
currently being considered by the Council of Ministers.
In addition to agriculture the Community budget includes spending on
regional and social policies; projects concerned with research, energy, the
environment, industry and transport; and aid to developing countries.
In Britain’s view, completion of the common internal market by removing the
remaining barriers impeding the movement of goods and services would be the
most effective means of promoting a more united Europe, and it would enable
the Community to compete on equal terms in world markets and generate
prosperity for its citizens. In 1985 the Community, with full British support,
agreed a target date (1992) for the completion of a genuinely free internal
market. In particular Britain wants action on harmonisation of standards,
the opening of public purchasing to competition, the modernisation and

improvement of customs procedures, mutual recognition of professional
qualifications, liberalisation of transport (including better and cheaper air
services) and a European financial services industry able to operate freely in all
member states and to meet competition from the United States and Japan.
During Britain’s Presidency in 1986 a record number of nearly 50 measures
were agreed to improve the operation of the internal market.
Britain favours the establishment of a system of deregulated transport within
the Community. It is therefore pressing for action to increase competition in
civil aviation and has welcomed the June 1986 agreement by transport
ministers to abolish by 1992 all quota restrictions on the movement of road
haulage in intra-Community trade. Britain’s links with other member states will
be improved as a result of the 1986 decision taken by Britain and France to
facilitate the construction and operation of a rail link under the Channel.
Community action seeks to encourage the development of new European
high-technology industries and the restructuring of older ones. The ESPRIT
programme supports research in advanced microelectronics, information
processing, software technology, office automation and integrated manufac¬
turing while the BRITE project is designed to promote the use of advanced
technology in motor vehicles, aeronautics, chemicals, textiles, engineering and
other industries. Member states also participate in the EUREKA programme set
up to improve European performance in high technology.
In traditional manufacturing member states have agreed that the steel
industry should be given the opportunity to develop proposals for restructuring
and that state aid to shipbuilding should help to adapt this industry to
prevailing market conditions.
Britain believes that the Community has an important role to play in fighting
unemployment. In December 1986, the Social Affairs Council agreed an action
programme for employment growth with the aim of promoting new businesses,
improving the working of the labour market, better training, and more help for
the long-term unemployed. It was based on proposals put forward by Britain, the
Irish Republic and Italy. Other measures agreed or adopted during the British
Presidency included a Commission action programme on small and medium
enterprises which was endorsed in outline, £ 1,000 million in loans to help small
businesses gain access to new technology and a Council resolution emphasising
the importance of cutting administrative burdens on business.
International co-operation is often necessary to deal with environmental
pollution which does not respect national boundaries. The Community has been
active in this area for some 15 years and its role has been given explicit legal
recognition in the Single European Act. Community instruments are concerned
with such issues as water and air pollution, the disposal of wastes, noise and the
protection of wild birds. Britain is actively participating in negotiations to
reduce emissions from large power plants as part of the effort to reduce acid
rain; in September 1986 the Government announced that three major coal-fired
power stations would be retrofitted with flue gas desulphurisation equipment
over the period from 1988 to 1997 at a cost of £780 million and that in future all
new coal-fired stations (some 6,000 megawatts of existing generating capacity)
would be fitted with similar technology. In May 1987 this was followed by the
launching of a new £170 million ten-year programme to install low nitrogen
oxide burners at the 12 largest power stations.
Britain is also concerned about pollution from vehicle exhausts, and,
following a British initiative, the Council of Ministers adopted a directive in
OVERSEAS RELATIONS

March 1985 providing for the introduction of unleaded petrol throughout the
Community not later than 1989.
Decisions on the level of Community support prices for agriculture are taken
annually on the basis of proposals presented by the European Commission. Over
many years these support prices have not been adjusted sufficiently to take
account of technical progress in agriculture which has caused a continued
increase in production. The growing market imbalance has led to the creation of
unwanted food surpluses. To deal with the problem, the Agriculture Council,
under British chairmanship, agreed in December 1986 to reduce Community
milk production by 9-5 per cent over two years and to restrict recourse to market
intervention in the beef sector, thereby effectively reducing beef support prices
by 13 per cent. Taken together these measures represent a major reform in
Community agricultural policies. Similar reforms are also required regarding
the pricing of cereals. Further tough measures, particularly on cereals and
oilseeds, were agreed in June 1987. Since the Common Agricultural Policy is by
far the largest item of Community expenditure, Britain considers reform to be
central to the Community’s efforts to ensure better budgetary control and
management.
Britain has a particular interest in the control of Community fishing since a
sizeable proportion of the total catch taken in the area bounded by member
states’ 200-mile limits is in British waters. It therefore took an active role in
negotiations on an agreement reached in 1983 on a new Community fisheries
policy; this covers access to coastal waters, conservation of fish stocks, the
allocation of catch quotas among member states within each year’s total
allowable catch, enforcement of these rules and financial aid to promote the
adaptation and development of the Community’s fishing fleet. In 1986 measures
were agreed to strengthen conservation of fish stocks and to monitor more
effectively compliance with Community fisheries policy.
The European Social Fund assists areas of high unemployment by providing
grants towards schemes of training, job creation and geographical mobility of
workers. The European Regional Development Fund provides grants for
industrial and infrastructure projects in the less-developed or industrially
declining regions of the Community with the aim of reducing existing
imbalances or preventing the creation of new ones. In 1986, Britain received
£336 million (17 per cent of the resources) from the regional fund and £414
million (16 per cent) from the social fund.
Britain also receives about a fifth of the lending of the European Investment
Bank, which was set up in 1958 to provide finance on a non-profit-making basis
for investment to develop the Community’s less-favoured regions, to modernise
industry and to help projects of common interest to two or more member states.
The European Monetary System was established in 1979 to promote monetary
stability in Europe. It consists of an exchange-rate mechanism, a monetary unit
known as the European Currency Unit (ECU—based on a ‘basket’ of national
currencies including sterling, the value of which is recalculated daily) which is
used within the Community for budgetary and other purposes, and enlarged
Community short- and medium-term credit facilities. The member states are
also committed to the establishment of a European Monetary Fund. Britain has
participated in the system from the outset, although not in the exchange-rate
arrangements, and has deposited 20 per cent of its gold and dollar currency
reserves with the European Monetary Co-operation Fund in exchange for ECUs.
The Government intends that Britain should join the exchange-rate mechanism
when conditions permit.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain has given high priority to Community action to combat drugs and
terrorism. In October 1986 a meeting of ministers responsible for these subjects
set up a high-level working group to study ways of improving co-operation
against crime and terrorism and an action plan to fight drug abuse. The
Community is also committed to closer co-operation in the fight against AIDS.
European Political Co-operation is the process of co-operation between the 12
member states on foreign policy issues. Its aim is to maximise the influence of
the Twelve in international affairs and it takes place outside the framework of
the Treaty of Rome.
The six original Community members first decided to co-operate on foreign
policy matters in 1970 and it was then decided to establish separate arrange¬
ments to cover foreign policy co-operation. Successive political agreements and
declarations have extended the scope of the process. Since Britain’s accession in
1973, it has played a leading role in developing European political co-operation;
as the result of a British initiative, the Single European Act, which came into
effect in July 1987, places the basic commitments on a treaty basis for the first
time.
Britain considers that the 12 member states should ensure that a coherent
Western European voice is heard in the management of East-West relations.
The Twelve have stressed the need for the Soviet Union to address humanitarian
issues seriously and to honour commitments made on human rights in the
1976 Helsinki Final Act (see p 85). At the current Vienna follow-up meeting, the
Twelve are pressing for a thorough review of how these commitments have been
complied with and for practical progress for the benefit of individual citizens
throughout Europe.
In July 1980, the European Council’s Venice Declaration stated that a lasting
solution to the problem of the Middle East required the mutual acceptance of
two basic principles—the right of all countries in the area, including Israel, to
secure existence within guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination. The Twelve support the proposal for an interna¬
tional peace conference on the Middle East. Member states have repeatedly called
on Israel to withdraw from territory occupied in 1967 and are opposed to Israeli
measures aimed at altering the legal, geographical and demographic structure of
this territory.
The Twelve have also consistently emphasised the importance of the complete
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, except for those whose presence is
requested by the Lebanese Government, and of the obligation on all parties to
co-operate with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. Member states have
consistently called for a ceasefire in the conflict between Iraq and Iran, and
support the United Nations Secretary-General’s efforts to achieve this.
The Twelve firmly believe that the problems of Central America must be solved by
political and not military means and that such solutions must come from within
the region. They have therefore consistently supported the efforts of the
Contadora Group (Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela) to negotiate a
comprehensive and verifiable peace agreement, most recently at the meeting of
foreign ministers from European Community, Central American and Contadora
countries in Guatemala City in February 1987. The Community has a
co-operation agreement with the Central American countries and Panama
providing for closer economic links and improved Community aid to the region.
Member states have deplored the Soviet Union’s continuing occupation of
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
79
South Africa

Trade
Afghanistan and continue to call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying
forces in order that a permanent settlement can be reached restoring the right of
the Afghan people to self-determination.
The Twelve have repeatedly called for a peaceful end to the system of apartheid.
They have adopted a wide range of measures in an attempt to bring home to the
South African Government the need for a genuine national dialogue and to help
the victims of apartheid. At the request of the European Council the Foreign and
Commonwealth Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, visited Southern Africa in late
July 1986 in an attempt to build on the work of the Commonwealth Group of
Eminent Persons, to help create conditions in which genuine dialogue could
begin in South Africa and to explain the Twelve’s policy to South Africa’s
neighbours. In September 1986 the Twelve called on the South African
Government to take the necessary steps to facilitate national dialogue and
undertook to work towards a programme of political action designed to promote
the achievement of this objective. They also emphasised the importance of
strengthened and more effective co-ordination of positive measures to assist the
victims of apartheid and adopted a new package of restrictive measures
consisting of bans on new investment and on the import of gold coins, iron and
steel from South Africa. Agreement has since been reached on the coverage and
means of implementing of these measures.
Because of the threat posed by international and other terrorism, some of which
has been state supported, member states have sought to act jointly against it.
Early in 1986 the Twelve decided not to export arms or other military equipment
to countries clearly implicated in terrorist activity and to take steps to prevent
such material being diverted for terrorist purposes. In the course of 1986 the
Twelve agreed to take measures against both Libya and Syria following evidence
of their involvement in terrorist activity. In December 1986 the European
Council agreed that there should be no concessions made under duress to
terrorists or their sponsors; that there should be improved police and
intelligence co-operation to prevent terrorism and bring the guilty to justice; and
that terrorist attacks against any member state should be met with a united
response. Among the measures agreed by ministers responsible for countering
terrorism are the establishment of a secure communications link between police
forces and arrangements for regular assessments and analyses of terrorist
threats to member states.
Under the Treaty of Rome, the European Commission is given explicit powers to
act on behalf of the Community vis-a-vis third countries on matters within
Community competence such as the common commercial policy. The Commis¬
sion accordingly negotiates on behalf of the Community in major international
trade negotiations. As a single trade bloc it plays a major role in seeking to
preserve the world open trading system on which member states depend for
future growth and jobs, and in defending the interests of its members against
protectionist measures. One of the Community’s priorities was the successful
launch in 1986 of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This new round will seek
to secure adherence to GATT rules; for the first time these negotiations will cover
trade in services, which accounts for about 20 per cent of world trade, and will
tackle agricultural trade problems. Another major trade development brought to
a successful conclusion in 1986 was the renewal for a further five years of the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement governing world trade in textiles and the consequen¬
tial renegotiation of 29 bilateral textile agreements between the Community and
third country suppliers. The Community also agreed its priorities for future
co-operation with the European Free Trade Association.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Aid
Association or co-operation agreements giving preferential access to Com¬
munity markets have been concluded with all countries with a Mediterranean
coastline except Albania and Libya. Non-preferential co-operation agreements
have also been made with individual countries in South Asia and Latin America
as well as with the Association of South East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact
and the Central American States. Trade relations with the developing countries
of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific are governed by the third Lome
Convention (see below).
The Community has also improved its generalised scheme of preferences
designed to benefit the poorest developing countries. The scheme provides
duty-free access for almost all manufactured and semi-manufactured goods
exported by developing countries and preferential access for agricultural
products. The 1987 scheme contains a number of innovations; highly competi¬
tive products from advanced developing countries will, for the first time, be
excluded. This is an important first step towards the acceptance by the newly
industrialised countries of their full GATT obligations.
The third Lome Convention, which governs aid, trade and co-operation between
the Community and 66 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific (ACP), was signed in December 1984 and came into force in May 1986.
Over half the ACP countries are members of the Commonwealth. The Conven¬
tion, which runs from 1986 to 1989, provides for aid totalling over £5,000
million and a further £770 million in the form of loans from the European
Investment Bank; it also covers industrial and agricultural co-operation, a
scheme designed to help stabilise the commodity export earnings of the ACP
countries and assistance for ACP mineral producers whose production and
income suffer from temporary disruptions beyond their control. In addition, it
offers duty-free access to the Community for ACP exports of all industrial and
most agricultural goods, including privileged access for sugar, bananas, rum
and beef. Emphasis is being placed on food production and on measures to
prevent desertification. All British dependent territories (with the exception of
Bermuda, Gibraltar and Hong Kong), together with the overseas territories of
other Community members, are formally associated with the Community under
provisions parallel to those of the Lome Convention and with similar aid and
trade benefits.
Britain played a leading part in the Community’s adoption of an aid
programme for developing countries in Asia and Latin America not covered by
the Lome Convention or having any other special relationship with the
Community. This has grown steadily since 1976 and was worth some £137
million in 1986. Priority is given to rural development and agricultural
production in the poorest countries,.most of which are in Asia.
Co-operation and association agreements with individual countries and
regional groupings also include provision for development aid. In 1987, for
instance, new five-year financial protocols were agreed with most of the
Community’s Mediterranean partners; these will provide for £445 million of
Community aid and £725 million in loans from the European Investment Bank.
In 1986 the Community spent some £276 million on food aid, of which
Britain’s share was about £59 million, much of which went to Africa. In the
same year, Britain reached agreement with its partners on far-reaching reforms
of the Community’s food aid programme designed to make it an effective
instrument of development policy rather than a short-term expedient for the
disposal of unwanted food surpluses.
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 49 independent states with a

Consultation
combined population of over 1,100 million, about a quarter of the world total.
Commonwealth members are a representative cross-section of nations at all
stages of social and economic development. They include some of the richest and
poorest members of the world community and also some of the largest and
smallest. Their peoples are drawn from practically all the world’s main races,
from all continents and from many faiths. Britain participates fully in all
Commonwealth activities and values it as a means of consulting and co¬
operating with peoples of widely different cultures and perspectives, thereby
increasing international understanding, stability and peace, and contributing
to more balanced global economic development.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji,
The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati,
Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri
Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda,
Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and Tuvalu are special
members, entitled to take part in all Commonwealth meetings and activities
except Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. The Queen is recognised
as head of the Commonwealth; she is also head of State in 18 of these countries.
The origin of the Commonwealth lies in the gradual granting of self-
government to the older-established British colonies (later known as the
Dominions) in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa1 where
European settlement had occurred on a large scale. Their fully independent
status in relation to Britain was legally formulated in the Statute of Westminster
of 1931. The modern Commonwealth, comprising republics and national
monarchies as well as monarchies under the Queen, became possible when it
was agreed in 1949 that India, on becoming a republic, could continue to be a
member. Since then, almost all of Britain’s former dependent territories have
attained their independence and have voluntarily joined the Commonwealth.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain participates in a system of mutual
consultation and co-operation which benefits member countries and contri¬
butes to international understanding. Consultation takes place through diplo¬
matic representatives known as High Commissioners, meetings of heads of
Government, specialised conferences of other ministers and officials, expert
groups, and discussions at international conferences and the United Nations.
Trade and cultural exhibitions and conferences of professional and unofficial
medical, cultural, educational and economic organisations are other ways in
which frequent contacts are made.
Heads of Government usually meet every two years, most recently in Nassau in
1985; they will next meet in Vancouver in October 1987. Proceedings are held in
private, facilitating a frank and informal exchange of views. No votes are taken,
decisions being reached by consensus. These meetings allow Prime Ministers
and Presidents to discuss international issues and decide on collective
initiatives. Common views on matters of major international concern are
formulated and reflected in the communiques issued at the ends of the
meetings. Occasionally, separate declarations are made on particular issues.
These have included the 1971 Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, the
1977 Gleneagles statement, which commits member governments to take every
practical step to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa, and the 1985
Commonwealth Accord on Southern Africa, which provides for measures
South Africa ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth in 1961.

designed to impress on South Africa the urgency of dismantling the apartheid
system. Following the failure of Commonwealth and other attempts in 1986 to
encourage the evolution of a political dialogue leading to the establishment of a
non-racial and representative government, a summit of seven Commonwealth
leaders, meeting in London in August 1986, agreed on the need for further
measures against South Africa. Britain, while believing that mandatory
economic sanctions would not succeed in promoting peaceful change, agreed to
impose voluntary bans on new investment in, and the promotion of tourism to.
South Africa, as well as to implement European Community decisions to ban the
import of iron and steel (see p 79).
With many small states among its members the Commonwealth has expressed
concern about their security and development. At Nassau Commonwealth
leaders called for action which would reduce the vulnerability of small states
while not diminishing their status as independent, sovereign and equal
members of the world community. British policy is to co-operate with other
member states in order to increase the security of small nations by encouraging
regional co-operation and by providing economic aid and technical assistance.
Finance ministers meet annually to discuss world economic problems, and in
recent years have paid particular attention to the problems of development and
the establishment of a fairer international economic order. Other meetings
include those of agriculture, education, health and law ministers which take
place every two or three years. Ministers of industry, labour and employment,
trade and women’s affairs also meet.
The Commonwealth Secretariat, established in London in 1965 and financed by
member states, is the main agency for multilateral communication between
them. It is headed by a Secretary-General appointed by heads of Government
and responsible to member states collectively.
The Secretariat promotes consultation, disseminates information on matters
of common concern, and organises meetings and conferences, including those
of heads of Government and of ministers. It co-ordinates many Commonwealth
activities related to international economic, social and political affairs, includ¬
ing education, food production and rural development, the role of women in
development, human rights, youth programmes, management development,
science and technology, law and health. The Secretariat also administers the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation.
Because of its neutral position the Secretariat has been able to make its good
offices available in cases of dispute, and has carried out, on request, special
assignments requiring demonstrable impartiality.
Britain plays an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, established within the Secretariat to provide technical
assistance for economic and social development in Commonwealth developing
countries, and contributes almost a third of its income. The Fund provides
experts to undertake advisory assignments or fill specific posts and uses
consultancy firms to make studies for governments. Its fellowships and training
programme is of particular help in raising levels of technical, industrial,
managerial and other skills, and makes wide use of training facilities within
developing member countries for the benefit of other developing countries. It
has a special programme to help countries develop their exports, another on
food production and rural development and a small technical assistance group
to give advice in key areas. An industrial development unit, the main executive
agency of the Commonwealth Action Programme of Industrial Co-operation,
investigates the feasibility of establishing new industries in developing coun¬
tries and helps to prepare and initiate agreed projects.

Expenditure by Britain on bilateral technical co-operation with Common¬
wealth developing countries in 1986 was nearly £130 million, the greater part
being spent on financing staff for service with Commonwealth governments and
in financing training places in Britain for people from Commonwealth
countries. In particular, Britain is a major contributor to the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a system of awards for people of high
intellectual promise to study in Commonwealth countries other than their own.
It was agreed in 1984 that the number of awards would be increased to about
1,700 of which Britain would provide some 800. In 1986, the Overseas
Development Administration’s Shared Scholarship Scheme, funded jointly by
the Government and certain universities and polytechnics, was introduced to
finance 150 new scholarships each year over a period of five years, the awards
being open to private sector students from developing Commonwealth coun¬
tries. Other assistance includes sending volunteers to serve overseas, consul¬
tancy services, the supply of training and research equipment and the provision
of advice by British scientific and technical institutions. (About 76 per cent of
Britain’s gross bilateral aid in 1986 went to Commonwealth countries,
including Britain’s remaining dependencies—see p 92.)
Commonwealth The Commonwealth Foundation was established in 1966 and reconstituted as
Organisations an international organisation in 1983. Financed by member governments, it
promotes closer co-operation among professional and other non-governmental
organisations within the Commonwealth. It has assisted over 30 Common¬
wealth professional associations, and has helped in the creation and growth of
many national ones; it has also supported 16 multidisciplinary professional
centres. It promotes understanding of work carried out by non-government
organisations and is encouraging the strengthening of information links
through the establishment of liaison units in each Commonwealth country.
The Commonwealth Institute in London promotes the Commonwealth, its
countries and its peoples to the British public. Funded mainly by the British
Government, it has three main galleries of permanent exhibitions and a
changing programme of temporary exhibitions, conferences and performances.
Its education service runs an extensive programme of teaching about the
Commonwealth in schools around Britain. The Institute is open to the public
every day without charge. The Royal Commonwealth Society, which is over 100
years old, is a centre for study and discussion, its library in London housing one
of the largest collections on the Commonwealth. The Society has branches in
many countries.
In keeping with the fact that the Commonwealth is an association of peoples
as well as governments, many unofficial organisations, professional bodies and
voluntary societies provide machinery for co-operation. Professional bodies
include associations of architects, doctors, educators, engineers, journalists,
lawyers, librarians, magistrates, museum curators, nurses, pharmacists,
planners, surveyors and veterinary surgeons. Other organisations include the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which organises an annual confer¬
ence of parliamentarians, the Commonwealth Press Union, the Association of
Commonwealth Universities, the Commonwealth Games Federation and the
English Speaking Union of the Commonwealth.
DEPENDENCIES There are 14 remaining British dependent territories: Anguilla; Bermuda;
British Antarctic Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory; British Virgin
Islands; Cayman Islands; Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Hong Kong; Montserrat;
Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno; St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension, Tristan da Cunha); South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;
and the Turks and Caicos Islands. They have a combined population of 5-5
84

million, of which 5-3 million live in Hong Kong. Few are rich in natural
resources, and some are scattered groups of islands. There are no permanent
inhabitants in the British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory or
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Most dependencies have
considerable self-government with their own legislature and civil service. Britain
is generally responsible, through a Governor, for defence, internal security and
foreign affairs.
It is Britain’s policy to give independence to those dependencies that want it
and where it is practicable to do so, and not to force it on those which do not or
where it is not practicable. In the case of the Falkland Islands, which is the
subject of a territorial claim by Argentina, the inhabitants wish to retain the link
with Britain. The Government is committed to the defence of the Islanders' right
to live under a government of their own choosing. The Islanders' right of
self-determination is reflected in the new Falkland Islands Constitution, which
came into effect in 1985.
Argentina and Chile have claims to territory which overlaps part of the British
Antarctic Territory. Claims to territorial sovereignty in the Antarctic, however,
are suspended by the provisions of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial claim by Spain, which imposed border
restrictions in the 1960s. Since the return of democracy to Spain, Britain and
Spain have reached agreement on the method for handling their differences over
Gibraltar, Spanish restrictions being lifted in February 1985. Britain wishes to
see the development of practical co-operation between Gibraltar and Spain to the
benefit of both peoples and remains committed to honouring the wishes of the
people of Gibraltar as to their future.
In 1984 an agreement was signed between Britain and the People’s Republic of
China on the future of Hong Kong. Under the agreement, which was ratified by
the two Governments in 1985, Britain will continue to be responsible for the
administration of Hong Kong until 1997, when the territory will be restored to
China. The Chinese Government will then establish a Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, which will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in
foreign and defence affairs. It will be vested with executive, legislative and
independent judicial powers and its government will be composed of local
inhabitants. The laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically
unchanged, as will its present social and economic systems and its way of life.
Private property rights and other rights and freedoms will be protected by law.
These arrangements will remain in place for 50 years after 1997.
International Peace and Security
Britain is concerned to protect its territorial integrity and political indepen¬
dence, as well as the interests of its dependencies and of its allies, and pursues
these objectives through a national security policy in which deterrence and
defence are coupled with efforts towards removing or alleviating the causes of
international tension and achieving balanced and verifiable international arms
control and disarmament.
British defence policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)1 which member countries regard as their guarantee of security, freedom
and well-being, and as an important contributor to international peace and
stability. The purpose of NATO is to enable its member countries to maintain
1 NATO's 16 member countries are Belgium, Britain. Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Turkey and the United States. France and Spain do not participate in NATO's integrated
military structure.

peace with freedom. It pursues a strategy of deterrence, designed to convince
any potential aggressor that the use of force, or the threat of it, carries risks far
outweighing any likely advantage. At the same time NATO countries seek
through international negotiations significant reductions in the level of nuclear
and conventional forces.
Britain's defence resources are concentrated almost exclusively on key NATO
tasks. However, the Government’s defence policy is also designed to promote,
whenever possible, British and more general Western interests outside the
NATO area. In addition, Britain demonstrates its world-wide interests by
periodic military deployments and exercises overseas; by supporting United
Nations and other peacekeeping efforts; and by providing military assistance
and training to a number of friendly countries.
Britain seeks improvements in East—West relations based on a broader
understanding and on the recognition that East and West have a common
interest in peace and security at a lower level of weapons. The Government
believes that both sides should avoid policies which risk provoking confronta¬
tion and should aim instead for mutual accommodation and co-operation while
exercising restraint in the conduct of international relations both in Europe and
in the rest of the world. This is explicitly recognised in the 1975 Helsinki Final
Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which
states that European security has to be considered in the broader context of
world security. Britain is committed to doing everything possible to reduce the
risks of war and to avoid misunderstanding. The Government is following a
policy of increased contacts at all levels with the Soviet Union and its allies; the
Prime Minister, for instance, visited Moscow in 1987 for talks with the Soviet
leaders. Britain welcomed the progress on nuclear arms control following the
Geneva and Reykjavik summits in 1985 and 1986 between the United States
and the Soviet Union (see p 86). The early and complete withdrawal of Soviet
forces from Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union invaded in 1979, would remove
an obstacle to improved relations between East and West.
Britain believes that full implementation by all participants of the provisions of
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act would lead to increased stability in Europe and
improved co-operation between the 35 European and North American signatory
states. While not a legally binding document, the Final Act established a large
number of important political commitments and a code of behaviour for what
the participants hope will in time become a more normal and open relationship
between both governments and peoples in East and West. To this end it contains
undertakings about security, respect for human rights, and co-operation in
economic, humanitarian and other matters. Meetings to review the application
of the Final Act took place in Belgrade in 1977—78 and in Madrid between 1980
and 1983: a third began in Vienna in November 1986. The Madrid meeting, at
which it was decided that renewed efforts should be made to give full effect to the
Final Act, also convened an experts’ meeting in Ottawa on the subject of human
rights, a cultural forum in Budapest in 1985 and a meeting concerning human
contacts which took place in Berne in 1986. Britain and other Western countries
have taken the opportunity of the Vienna meeting to highlight the failure of the
Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries to implement many of the
commitments contained in the Final Act, particularly in the areas of human
rights, human contacts and information. Together with its partners and allies,
Britain has also tabled a number of new proposals to improve implementation in
the future.
As a result of the Madrid meeting, a Conference on Confidence- and
Security-Building Measures and Disarmament took place in Stockholm between
86

and

1984 and 1986 at which Britain and its NATO allies proposed an agreement that
would lead to increased openness about military activities, thus reducing the
likelihood of hostilities and the risk of miscalculation in times of tension. These
proposals were incorporated in an agreement, signed by all 35 participating
states in September 1986, which included advance notification and subsequent
observation of planned military manoeuvres above specified thresholds and
detailed information on their purpose, size, composition and dates, as well as
provisions for their verification and on-site inspection.
Together with France, the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain is a
signatory to the 1972 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, which reaffirms the
four countries’ rights and responsibilities there, and provides for greatly
improved travel and communications facilities between West Berlin and the
Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin,
and for the maintenance and development of the ties between West Berlin and
the Federal Republic.
Britain is committed to the search for significant balanced and verifiable
measures of arms control and disarmament, and has played a prominent part in
multilateral disarmament negotiations. Britain is a participating state in the
Conference on Disarmament at Geneva, and in the Mutual and Balanced Force
Reductions negotiations at Vienna; it also takes an active part in disarmament
deliberations under the auspices of the United Nations.
Britain strongly supports the negotiations between the United States and the
Soviet Union on nuclear and space arms, which began in Geneva in 1985. It fully
shares the agreed objective of working out effective agreements aimed at
preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and
reducing nuclear arms and at strengthening strategic stability.
The British Government welcomed the meeting between the United States and
the Soviet Union at Reykjavik in October 1986, at which progress was made
towards agreements to eliminate longer-range intermediate nuclear forces (INF)
in Europe and to reduce US and Soviet strategic offensive forces by 50 per cent.
Britain welcomed the Soviet decision in February 1987 to accept NATO’s 1981
zero option offer to eliminate longer-range INF in Europe and to separate this
question from space issues. The United States and the Soviet Union are
negotiating an agreement that would eliminate globally both longer- and
shorter-range INF. Britain takes an active part in NATO consultations on
progress in the negotiations in Geneva.
Britain’s nuclear deterrent is a minimum force which will remain so after the
introduction in service of the Trident system, and is very small in comparison
with Soviet nuclear forces. The priority therefore is for reductions in the
arsenals of the superpowers. None the less, Britain has made it clear that, if the
US and Soviet strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced and there
had been no significant changes in Soviet defensive capability, Britain would
review the position and consider how best it could contribute to arms control in
the light of the reduced threat.
Britain has played a leading part in strengthening the regime of non¬
proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is a party to the most widely supported arms
control agreement in existence, the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is
designed both to stop the spread of nuclear weapons by providing an assurance
through international safeguards that nuclear facilities of non-nuclear-weapon
states will not be used for making such weapons and to protect the right of all
countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Britain was the first
nuclear-weapon state to conclude an agreement with the International Atomic
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
87
Chemical
and Biological
Weapons
Conventional
Weapons
Energy Agency, which administers the safeguards. Britain reaffirmed its full
support for the Treaty at a review conference in 1985, and has been active in
strengthening it by seeking the widest possible adherence. It has also
undertaken not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states
which are parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty or other internationally
binding commitments not to manufacture or acquire nuclear explosive devices:
this assurance would, however, not apply in the case of an attack on Britain, its
dependent territories, its armed forces or its allies by such a state in association
or alliance with a nuclear weapon state. Britain believes that limiting the
security assurances to these states provides further support for nuclear
non-proliferation.
Britain is also fully committed to progress towards a comprehensive, verifiable
ban on all nuclear tests, and in recent years has tabled papers on verification at
the Conference on Disarmament. However, solutions to verification problems
need to be clearer before it would be appropriate to resume negotiations.
The British Government thinks that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free
zones in certain parts of the world could contribute to regional security, to
non-proliferation and to disarmament in general, provided that nuclear
weapons do not already feature in the security of the region involved, that all
states concerned are prepared to participate on the basis of agreements freely
entered into and in keeping with internationally recognised principles and that
the balance of security is maintained. Britain was the first nuclear-weapon state
to ratify the two additional protocols to the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco establishing
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America. Britain has announced that it is
not in its interests to become a party to the three additional protocols to the
1985 Treaty of Rarotonga, which establishes a nuclear-free zone in the South
Pacific. However, the Government has made it clear that Britain has no
intention of testing, manufacturing or basing nuclear weapons in the area.
Britain is committed to achieving a comprehensive and verifiable world-wide
ban on chemical weapons, having abandoned its own chemical warfare
capability in the late 1950s. Britain tabled a draft treaty in 1976 and in more
recent years has presented a number of major papers to the Conference on
Disarmament on compliance and verification of a Convention banning chemical
weapons and on the organisation that would be needed to implement the
Convention's provisions.
As a result of a British initiative, biological weapons are the subject of the
1972 Convention on Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stock¬
piling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruc¬
tion. A review conference which took place in September 1986 reaffirmed the
value of the Convention and adopted measures which would involve the
exchange of information (the arrangements for which were finalised at a
meeting of experts in Geneva in 1987) aimed at increasing confidence between
the parties and thereby strengthening the authority of the Convention.
Conventional weapons are by far the largest component of national armouries.
In the Vienna negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR),
Britain, together with its NATO allies, is working for an agreement with the
Warsaw Pact participants which would contribute to a more stable relationship
and strengthen peace and security in Europe. This would require an approxi¬
mate parity between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in central Europe where the
Warsaw Pact troops currently outnumber those of NATO by at least 200,000.
Progress in the talks has been slow, mainly because of a long-standing
disagreement over the size of Eastern forces in the reduction area. In an attempt
to break the deadlock, the West tabled new proposals in December 1985 which.

based on ideas put forward by Britain and the Federal Republic of Germany,
involve initial reductions of 5,000 US and 11,500 Soviet troops without
insisting on prior agreement on force levels. Britain is also participating with its
NATO partners in discussions with the Warsaw Pact in Vienna aimed at
agreeing a mandate for negotiations on increased conventional stability at lower
force levels throughout the whole of Europe.
Concerned about the rising scale of military expenditure in the world, Britain
has supported proposals at the United Nations for the balanced and verifiable
reduction of military budgets. Britain and its allies and partners have
participated actively in developing a standardised system for reporting annual
military expenditure to establish a basis for future comparison. Britain
welcomes efforts to promote increased openness in the reporting of military
expenditure and to this end has submitted figures on its military budget.
British experts have taken part in a number of UN studies on aspects of arms
control and disarmament.
Britain and the United Nations
Support for the United Nations and the purposes and principles of its Charter
has been a cornerstone of British policy since 1945. Britain sees a strong and
effective United Nations as a means of pursuing and achieving many of its
foreign policy objectives such as the peaceful resolution of disputes, disarma¬
ment and arms control, the protection of human rights and the promotion of the
rule of law. It believes that all member states have a responsibility to ensure that
the organisation’s efforts are devoted to the furtherance of the principles
enshrined in the Charter, and has suggested reforms to make it more effective.
The maintenance of international peace and security was the primary purpose
envisaged for the United Nations at the time of its establishment. Britain
believes that it is appropriate for the United Nations, as the only forum in which
almost the whole international community is represented, to seek to resolve
disputes which threaten peace and stability whether on a regional or world
scale. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain plays an active
part in the Council’s work and has sought to develop and improve its role in the
peaceful settlement of disputes.
In 1985, for example, Britain argued that the Council should engage in more
preventive diplomacy in an effort to help countries engaged in a dispute before it
reached an acute stage. Britain proposed a new form of Council meeting of a
private and formal nature which would include states engaged in the dispute
under discussion but would minimise opportunities for propaganda. Britain
has also put forward proposals for rationalising the work of the General
Assembly.
Britain strongly supports the United Nations’ peacekeeping role, is the major
contributor to the UN Force in Cyprus and has provided logistic support to the
UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
Britain has consistently supported the efforts of the United Nations to promote
human rights throughout the world through the establishment of inter¬
nationally accepted standards. The UN Charter itself includes among the
purposes of the United Nations the achievement of international co-operation in
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. Britain
believes that this and the subsequent practice of the United Nations has
established human rights as a legitimate matter for international concern and
that the UN Charter imposes on member governments an obligation to
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
89
Economic and
Social Affairs
co-operate with appropriate UN bodies in the pursuit of policies which promote
human rights.
Fundamental human rights provisions are set out in the Universal Declara¬
tion of Human Rights proclaimed by the General Assembly in 1948, and in the
two International Covenants (one on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and
the other on Civil and Political Rights) which impose legal obligations on those
who ratify them and which came into force in 1976. Britain played a large part in
their drafting and ratified the two Covenants in 1976. It also accepted the
optional Article 41 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognising the
competence of the Human Rights Committee established under this Covenant to
receive and consider state complaints. (It is not party to the Optional Protocol to
the Covenant which recognises the right of individuals to submit communica¬
tions to the Committee; Britain recognises the right of individual petition under
the European Convention on Human Rights.) Britain is also a party to other
international instruments, including conventions on the elimination of racial
discrimination and of discrimination against women, prevention of genocide,
the abolition of slavery, the status of refugees and stateless persons, the political
rights of women, and consent to marriage. In March 1985 Britain signed the UN
Convention against Torture which was adopted with British support by the
General Assembly in December 1984.
The adoption of conventions and covenants in itself is insufficient to secure
the protection of human rights. It is up to states themselves to do that. Britain
constantly urges states to adhere to those standards which have been agreed
internationally as the basis of that protection. Britain has also supported the
establishment of additional mechanisms such as the appointment of Special
Rapporteurs or Representatives of the UN Commission on Human Rights to
investigate human rights abuses in specific countries or globally.
Britain plays a leading part in the discussion of human rights in the various
multilateral fora provided by the United Nations. In 1987 it was re-elected to the
UN Commission on Human Rights for a further three-year term, and the British
delegation will continue to build on the initiatives taken there. There are British
experts on the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities, on the Human Rights Committee (which monitors the
implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights by the parties to it), on the Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination established under the Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination and on the UN Commission on the Status of
Women.
The UN Charter states that ‘the promotion of the economic and social
advancement of all peoples’ is one of the principal aims of the United Nations,
and an estimated 90 per cent of the organisation’s efforts, in terms of resources
and personnel, is now employed to this end. With the growing concern for the
problems of development, the main emphasis has become increasingly the
provision of direct assistance for member states. The UN system is now the
largest single source of technical assistance for developing countries, as well as
providing considerable emergency and relief aid, assistance for refugees and
help in combating the problems associated with drug production, trafficking
and abuse. (The provision of capital assistance has been generally confined to
the World Bank group and regional development banks whose operations are
usually considered separately from those of the rest of the UN system.)
Successive British governments have affirmed their support for the functional
and developmental work of the United Nations. Britain is the sixth largest
contributor to the UN's regular budget, providing some £23-5 million, 4-86 per
cent of the total, in 1986. In addition, it contributed some £7-7 million to the
90
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
World Health Organisation, £3-9 million to the International Labour Organisa¬
tion and £7-4 million to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Britain provides
considerable contributions to the UN’s voluntary funds, donating £21 million in
1986 for the UN Development Programme, £17-3 million for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, £5 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for
Palestinian Refugees, £6-7 million for the UN Children’s Fund, £4-5 million for
the UN Fund for Population Activities, and about £05 million for the World Food
Programme. Britain is also a major donor to the UN Fund for Drug Abuse
Control.
In the deliberations of the governing bodies of the various agencies and
programmes, Britain encourages the deployment of the resources towards the
poorest countries and the poorest communities in the developing world. It also
seeks to promote the most efficient use of UN development resources and
improvements in the co-ordination, control and effectiveness of the system, in
order to avoid unnecessary duplication by the various agencies.
In December 1985, Britain withdrew from the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The decision followed a period
of notice of withdrawal during which Britain worked within UNESCO to secure
its reform. Although Britain supports the ideals and objectives contained in
UNESCO's constitution, it had major doubts about the effectiveness with which
the Organisation was pursuing them. Aid amounting to £6-4 million, represent¬
ing funds saved from the withdrawal, has been allocated to a number of
educational, scientific and cultural programmes in developing countries.
Other International Organisations
Britain is a member of many other international organisations, including those
concerned with the management of the world economy. It is a founder member
of the International Monetary Fund, established in 1945 (along with the World
Bank) to regulate the international financial system and to provide a source of
credit for member countries facing balance of payments problems, and has
welcomed the creation by the Fund of facilities to provide special assistance to
developing countries experiencing financial or trading difficulties. The British
Government strongly supports the objectives of the current Uruguay Round of
negotiations conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade; launched in 1986 they are designed to liberalise world trade further
and promote its growth especially for developing countries, and are focusing on
a number of specific areas such as agriculture and services.
Britain is also a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). An instrument for intergovernmental co-operation among
24 industrialised countries, the OECD’s aims are to promote policies designed
to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment, and a
rising standard of living in member countries while maintaining financial
stability, and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy; to
assist developing countries; and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on
a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international
obligations.
Other organisations to which Britain belongs or extends support are more
restricted in their operations and include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Americas and Asia and specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
With 20 other nations Britain is a member of the Council of Europe, which
aims to provide the widest possible European forum for the discussion of
political, economic, social, cultural and scientific issues with a view to achieving
greater unity between its members. Membership is open to any European

parliamentary democracy which accepts the principles of the rule of law and the
protection of human rights. The Council was responsible for the adoption in
1950 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain became
a party in 1951. In 1985, with Britain's support, the Council adopted a
declaration reaffirming its commitment to respect for human rights and calling
upon all countries to comply fully with their international obligations in this
area. In January 1986 Britain renewed its acceptance for a further five years of
the optional articles of the Convention which recognise both the right of
individual petition and the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of
Human Rights.
Development Co-operation
The basic objective of Britain’s aid programme is the promotion of sustainable,
non-inflationary economic and social progress and the alleviation of poverty in
developing countries. Britain’s ability to support development overseas is
dependent on the state of its own economy, and alongside development
objectives, due weight is given to political, commercial and industrial considera¬
tions in the deployment of aid resources.
Official aid is only one aspect of Britain’s support for overseas development.
Private investment is also important and benefited from the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979. Britain is one of the world’s largest overseas
investors: in 1986 estimated net outward direct investment by British com¬
panies in developing countries amounted to £1,850 million out of a total of
£10,000 million. Such investment is important not only because of the money
provided but because of the transfer of skills, management expertise and the
development of indigenous resources which accompany it. Trade, too, is vital,
developing countries providing 13 per cent of British imports in 1986.
Aid is also provided by voluntary agencies which concentrate their activities in
the poorest countries. Some of their activities receive substantial support from
the official aid programme.
In order to assist the poorest and most heavily indebted countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, Britain has proposed international action to reduce interest
rates payable on these debts to well below market levels, to convert aid loans into
grants and to allow for longer repayment periods in rescheduling other official
loans.
Britain’s aid represents part of a wider Western effort to help developing
countries. In 1986 total net official development assistance disbursed by the 18
countries belonging to the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee,
amounted to $37,021 million. Members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries provided $4,540 million and countries belonging to the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (the Soviet bloc countries) an
estimated $4,200 million.
In 1986 total official flows1 of aid amounted to some £1,420 million net, of which
£1,193 million represented official development assistance and £227 million
other official flows. Of the former, bilateral aid accounted for £697 million
including technical co-operation funds of £276 million; some £496 million was
provided through multilateral agencies. Repayments of capital came to £84
1 ‘Total official flows' is an international reporting concept. Its main component—official
development assistance—is defined as official flows for development purposes with a grant
(concessional) element of 25 per cent or more. The main British reporting concept is public
expenditure on overseas aid' which differs from total official Hows by excluding certain British
flows which benefit developing countries but are not considered developmental, and by recording
some contributions to multilateral agencies at a different time. All concepts can be measured
before (gross) or after (net) deducting capital repayments.

million; another £25 million of capital repayments and £2 million of interest
were cancelled. Payment on interest came to £66 million.
Aid performance is commonly measured as a proportion of gross national
product (GNP), particularly with reference to the two UN targets for resource
transfers to developing countries: these state that net official development
assistance should equal 0-7 per cent of GNP and that combined private and
official flows should equal 1 per cent of GNP. Britain accepts in principle the first
of these but is not committed to a timetable for reaching it. Successive
governments have made it clear that progress must depend on Britain's
economic situation and upon other calls on its resources. In 1986 net official
development assistance amounted to £1,193 million, 0-32 per cent of GNP, close
to the total 0-36 per cent for donor countries belonging to the OECD’s
Development Assistance Committee. Total net financial flows from Britain to
developing countries amounted to £5,015 million, 1-34 per cent of GNP.
Britain's aid programme began as part of the discharge of its responsibilities
towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains on the
Commonwealth, which includes among its members some of the world’s poorest
countries. In 1986, £847 million of gross public expenditure on overseas aid was
disbursed bilaterally. Some £535 million (76 per cent of that directly allocated to
countries) went to the Commonwealth, including £46 million to Britain’s
remaining dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid programme. Aid
was disbursed regionally as follows: Asia £302 million, Africa £285 million, the
Americas and the Caribbean £60 million. Pacific (Oceania) £32 million, Europe
£19 million and the Middle East £11 million. (A further £136 million was not
allocable by region.)
The country receiving the largest amount (£143 million) was India. Other
major recipients included Malaysia, Bangladesh, Zambia, Kenya, Sudan,
Pakistan and Ghana. In line with the policy of concentrating aid on the
poorest countries, 62-5 per cent of gross bilateral aid went to the poorest 50
developing countries (excluding states with a population under 100,000 and
dependencies).
Gross bilateral financial aid in 1986 totalled £520 million. Aid for individual
projects totalled £401 million, the principal sectors supported being agriculture,
fisheries and forestry (£69 million), manufacturing (£7 million), energy (£106
million), mining (£57 million), transport and communications (£46 million) and
social and community services (£80 million). Non-project aid totalled £119
million, of which £56 million was for import financing, £8 million for food aid,
£29 million for debt relief, £8 million for budgetary support and £19 million for
disaster relief. About 99 per cent of the ODA's financial aid in 1986 was provided
in grants. Since 1975, development aid to the poorest countries has been on
grant terms. In 1984 these terms were extended to the majority of recipients of
British financial aid, and simplified loan terms were introduced for those
countries still not qualifying for grants. Britain has more than fulfilled the 1978
resolution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on
easing the terms of financial aid. Britain has concluded agreements to remove
the burden of past aid loans worth over £1,000 million from 22 of the poorest
countries.
Financial aid is normally tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain (58 per cent in 1986), although there may be a substantial
element for local costs and foreign content in contracts financed from tied aid in
appropriate cases. Commitments can be untied, if the recipient agrees, to the
extent that goods can be purchased either from the poorest developing countries
or from Britain.

Aid Projects

Co-operation
Britain’s aid programme aims to promote development by providing essential
economic infrastructure in areas such as communications and power supplies;
by improving human resources through education, health services or housing;
and by raising incomes directly through improvement of agricultural and
industrial productivity. Most aid projects also try to help local organisations to
take increasing responsibility for future development through training in the
country concerned or in Britain. Major projects currently being supported by
Britain through the aid programme include improved tsetse and trypanosomias
control in Somalia to free 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) from tsetse infestation
and to lead to an increase in the production of milk and cattle and camel meat.
In Bangladesh, Britain is to contribute £8 million to a major international effort
to support the Government's population programme, the aims being to reduce
infant mortality by up to 25 per 1,000 live births, to save mothers’ lives, and to
help reduce population growth by increasing the use of contraceptives. In Nepal,
in addition to the rehabilitation of 40 km (25 miles) of road, support is being
given to a forestry project designed to produce 700,000 cubic metres (24-7
million cubic feet) of fuel wood and 500,000 tonnes of leaf fodder; over 500,000
people will benefit and the project will also reduce the risk of further
deforestation of the hills.
Under the Aid and Trade Provision, which is designed to match the mixed
credit practices of other donors by providing aid in combination with export
credits to support sound development projects which offer commercial opportu¬
nities to British exporters, expenditure amounted to £78 million. In November
1985, the Government introduced a new soft loan facility under the Provision in
order to respond to the preferences of certain developing countries and to
counter the practices of competitors. Increased funds are being made available
to enable British companies to double by 1988-89 the business won annually
with the Provision. As a matter of general policy, however, the Government
would like to see a reduction in the use of mixed credit by all exporting nations
in the interests of more open competition and freer trade.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation is empowered to invest in
Commonwealth countries which have achieved independence since 1948, the
remaining British dependencies and, with ministerial approval, in other
developing countries. Its aim is to assist in the development of these countries’
economies. By the end of 1986, the Corporation had invested some £675 million
out of a total commitment of £972-2 million. Of this total, £436-8 million was in
Africa, £272-4 million in Asia, £155-3 million in the Caribbean and Latin
America and £103-9 million in the Pacific Islands. Commitments approved in
1986 totalled over £100 million, of which 47 per cent was allocated to
agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
Technical co-operation, the transfer of specialised knowledge and skills from
country to country, complements financial aid, expertise often being essential to
the success of a programme of financial aid or investment. Expenditure on it has
increased in recent years and was £291 million, 34 per cent of gross bilateral
aid, in 1986. This included £72 million for the provision of expert personnel,
including volunteers, £60 million for students and trainees in Britain and
overseas, £42 million for the British Council's education and training program¬
mes, £20 million for research services and projects, £33 million for consultancy
services, and £10 million for the provision of equipment and supplies.
At the end of 1986 there were 1,750 people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers) working in developing countries, of whom 673 were engaged in the
field of education, 300 in agriculture and allied fields, and 164 in health
services. In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme there were 1,258
volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in developing

countries, about half in education. Recruitment, training and placing overseas
is undertaken by four voluntary bodies (Catholic Institute for International
Relations, International Voluntary Service, United Nations Association Interna¬
tional Service and Voluntary Service Overseas), the bulk of their costs being met
by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Some 12,200 were financed in 1986 under regional programmes of
technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, and under British Council schemes. In early 1983 the
Government decided to make an additional £46 million available (some outside
the aid programme) over the next three years for the support of overseas
students. A new scheme for students from Commonwealth developing countries
was introduced in 1986 (see p 83).
To support development overseas, the Government maintains a specialist
scientific organisation, the Overseas Development Natural Resources Institute
(formed in 1987 as the result of a merger between the Tropical Development and
Research Institute and the Land Resources Centre), and provides support for
many others, including overseas units/divisions of the government-financed
Transport and Road Research Laboratory, the Building Research Establish¬
ment, the British Geological Survey, the Overseas Surveys Directorate of the
Ordnance Survey, and of Hydraulics Research Ltd. These organisations provide
specialist information, advice and experts for service overseas, and undertake
field and laboratory research investigations.
To ensure the most effective use of aid resources, the objectives and content of
country aid programmes are determined through a systematic programming
exercise which takes account of the circumstances of the recipient country, its
development priorities, the activities of other donors, and what Britain can offer
by way of expertise, goods and services. In addition, individual projects are
carefully appraised before approval, monitored during progress against quantifi¬
able targets and assessed in a project completion report, while a programme of
special evaluation studies, often undertaken by independent evaluators,
examines in more detail the achievements of particular projects and of special
issues. The Overseas Development Administration also supports international
studies of aid effectiveness.
Britain is a major subscriber to the World Bank group of institutions—the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International
Development Association (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation. The
resources of the IDA, which provides interest-free loans to developing countries
unable to service loans on conventional terms, are replenished at roughly
three-year intervals. The British commitment to its Eighth Replenishment (July
1987 to June 1990) is £524 million towards a total of $12,000 million. Britain
contributes to the resources of the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Develop¬
ment Bank. Its contribution to the United Nations Development Programme for
1986 was £21 million, and it is the largest source of expertise and the second
largest of fellowships and equipment provided under the Programme. There is
also a major British contribution to other UN agencies and programmes,
including the World Health Organisation’s special programme for the prevention
and control of AIDS. Some 44 per cent of British multilateral aid is now
channelled through the European Community’s aid programme. Britain’s
commitment to the sixth European Development Fund established by the third
Lome Convention, covering the period from 1985 to 1989, is over £800 million
at present exchange rates.

Voluntary
Agencies
Voluntary agencies provided an estimated £130 million net for work in
developing countries in 1986, mainly on agriculture, health and nutrition,
education projects, and emergency relief operations.
There are about 200 agencies in all, including church and missionary
societies; among the best known are Oxfam, Christian Aid, War on Want, the
Save the Children Fund, the British Red Cross Society and the Catholic Fund for
Overseas Development. The funds are raised largely through regular donations
and collections, legacies and trading activities and, particularly in response to
specific emergencies, through appeals in the media. The Government co¬
operates with the agencies in various ways, especially in immediate post¬
disaster relief and rehabilitation operations and through its Joint Funding
Scheme. Under this it meets half the cost of selected development projects
undertaken by the agencies and aimed at helping the poorest people. Such
projects include community health, non-formal education, the improvement of
food supplies, agricultural training, water supply and irrigation. Expenditure
on the Scheme in 1986 was some £5-4 million.
Voluntary agencies’ work on behalf of refugees overseas also receives official
support.
4 Defence
Organisation
and
Management
The primary objectives of Britain's defence policy are to ensure the country’s
security, to preserve peace with freedom, and to enable it to pursue, by just and
peaceful means, its legitimate interests both within Britain and overseas.
Britain’s policy is based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a
defensive alliance whose collective strength provides each of its members with
far greater security than any could achieve alone. Britain is fully committed to
NATO and its strategy of deterrence and, in assigning directly or indirectly to
NATO the vast majority of its forces and over 95 per cent of its defence budget,
makes a major contribution to the Alliance’s deterrent capabilities. It also plays a
full part in the Alliance’s efforts, complementary to its defence preparations, to
negotiate balanced and verifiable arms control agreements and to reduce
tension so as to achieve a more just and lasting peace in Europe.
The defence budget for 1987—88 is nearly £18,800 million. In 1986 Britain’s
defence expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product was an estimated
51 per cent, the highest in NATO after the United States and Greece.
Within the budget, resources have been switched from manpower to
equipment (some 45 per cent of Britain’s defence expenditure is devoted to
equipment); manpower is being used with increased effectiveness, particularly
by diverting personnel from non-operational support to front-line tasks; and
measures are in hand to improve efficiency and value for money, especially
through increased competition in the purchase of equipment.
Britain’s defence programme is designed to ensure the most effective use of
these resources in pursuit of its commitment to Western security, the main
threat to which is posed by the nuclear and conventional forces of the Warsaw
Pact. In recent years the structure and balance of the defence forces have been
improved to increase their combat effectiveness and so enhance Britain’s
contribution to NATO. As a result of these improvements Britain also has the
flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to challenges to its interests outside
the NATO area.
The Ministry of Defence was reorganised in 1985 to improve policy formulation
and to tighten control over the defence budget, while devolving responsibility for
day-to-day management to the Services and the Procurement Executive.
The new structure established an integrated military/civilian Defence Staff
responsible for defence policy and strategy, operational requirements and
commitments; it reports to the Chief of Defence Staff and the Permanent
Under-Secretary through a Vice-Chief of Defence Staff. An Office of Management
and Budget reporting to the Permanent Under-Secretary is concerned with
budgetary control and resource management. Each Service Chief of Staff reports
through the Chief of Defence Staff to the Secretary of State on matters related to
the fighting effectiveness, management, efficiency and morale of his Service.
The management of the three Services is exercised through executive commit¬
tees of the Service Boards, which are chaired by their respective Chiefs of Staff,
and act in accordance with centrally determined policy objectives and budgets.
The Procurement Executive deals with the purchase of equipment, including
equipment collaboration with allies and friendly nations.

NATO’s
Strategy
Britain’s
NATO
Contribution
A management information system enables ministers and senior manage¬
ment to scrutinise the activities, costs and efficiency of all areas of the Ministry.
Increased awareness of the need to manage resources cost-effectively is being
promoted, with managers becoming more accountable for the resources
allocated.
NATO's security policy is based on deterrence and defence, its aims being to
prevent war or, should aggression occur, to respond at the right level to make
the aggressor quickly cease his attack and withdraw. This strategy, called
flexible response, is based on three key principles: a manifest determination to
act jointly and to defend the Treaty area against all forms of aggression: a
recognisable capability to respond effectively at all levels of aggression, and to
escalate, if necessary, in order to convince the Warsaw Pact of NATO's resolve:
and a flexibility that prevents the Soviet Union from predicting with confidence
NATO's specific response to aggression but which would leave it in no doubt of
the grave risk it would run in resorting to the use or the threat of force against
the Alliance. These principles in turn are built on a combination of political will
and military capacity. The latter comprises the following elements, which must
be both visible and credible: adequate conventional forces deployed well forward
to deter any Soviet non-nuclear attack; theatre nuclear forces to enhance
deterrence by providing a link between conventional and strategic nuclear
forces, and deterring the use of similar weapons by the other side; and strategic
nuclear forces to provide the ultimate deterrent by having the ability to inflict
unacceptable damage against a potential enemy, even after suffering a
pre-emptive first strike.
To maintain the Alliance’s defence and deterrent capacity, NATO members
have agreed, among other things, to improve their conventional defences,
including a doubling of funds for infrastructure projects such as airfield and
port facilities and communications systems, an increase in ammunition stocks
and the continued exploitation of new technology (including the co-ordination of
research and procurement). NATO’s intermediate-range nuclear forces are also
being modernised. Britain is actively involved in these measures, and is also
updating its own strategic nuclear capability.
The NATO allies have acknowledged the continuing Soviet threat to Western
interests outside the NATO area and recognised the need, in the last resort, for
those members with the means to do so to take action in consultation with their
allies. At the same time, the NATO allies recognise the right of regional countries
to self-determination and, as far as possible, to defend themselves. In the
Government’s view, these principles can best be satisfied through the provision
of military assistance, including training courses in Britain, the loan of Service
personnel and the sale of defence equipment. Britain's commitment to these
principles is also demonstrated by periodic deployments, exercises and the
maintenance of a capability to intervene militarily in the last resort.
Britain's contribution to NATO is concentrated in areas where it can best help to
maintain Alliance security, principally NATO's strategic nuclear deterrent and
the defence of the Central Region of Europe, the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, and the British home’ base and its immediate approaches.
Britain’s strategic forces, now equipped with improved Polaris missiles (to be
replaced by a Trident force in the 1990s) represent an essential European
element in NATO’s deterrent strategy, by providing a second and independent
centre of decision-making within the Alliance and an important insurance
against any Warsaw Pact misconception that the United States would not be
prepared to use its nuclear forces in Europe's defence. Britain has also
committed its other nuclear systems to NATO, and is continuing to provide
DEFENCE

bases for ground-launched cruise missiles which, with Pershing II missiles, the
United States began deploying in Europe from 1983 in order to modernise
NATO's intermediate-range nuclear forces.
Britain's decision to update its strategic deterrent has led to increased calls
from some groups within the country for unilateral nuclear disarmament, both
on the grounds of cost and as an example to others. While the Government
understands the widespread concern regarding nuclear war, it believes that the
best way of preventing war between East and West—nuclear and conventional—
is firm support for NATO's policy of nuclear deterrence and efforts to relax
East-West tensions, including the pursuit of arms control, which have helped to
maintain peace in Europe for more than 40 years. The Government believes that
unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain would weaken NATO’s ability to deter
aggression in the face of the continuing Soviet nuclear and conventional threat,
without significantly altering the views on arms control of other states which
possess, or may think of acquiring, nuclear weapons.
Virtually all of the Royal Navy, the largest navy among the European NATO
partners, is earmarked for assignment to the Alliance and permanent contribu¬
tions are made to NATO’s two standing naval forces, in the Atlantic and the
Channel, and to its Mediterranean force when activated. The British Army of the
Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF) Germany are stationed in the Federal
Republic of Germany. BAOR s combat element consists of three strong divisions
(with supporting artillery), one division containing three armoured brigades
and the two other divisions each containing two armoured brigades and an
infantry brigade (one of the latter being an air-mobile brigade that will convert
into an armoured formation in 1988). Additionally, a reinforcing division
comprising one regular and two Territorial Army brigades is located in Britain.
On mobilisation, BAOR s peacetime strength of around 55,000 would be almost
trebled by rapid reinforcement from Britain. Nearly all the RAF’s combat and
support aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany’s 14 squadrons (two of
helicopters) are equipped for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, air
defence and air transport roles, while RAF Strike Command, which is based in
Britain, provides forces for these and for the maritime patrol and anti¬
submarine warfare roles.
Britain also provides important elements of NATO’s specialist reinforcement
forces, including shipping and marine commando units forming the bulk of a
British—Netherlands amphibious force, ground and air units for the Allied
Command Europe Mobile Force, and several squadrons for NATO’s Strategic Air
Reserve.
Forces from all three Services are stationed at Gibraltar, which, positioned at
the western entry to the Mediterranean, is an important base for NATO.
Britain’s contribution to NATO is part of the wider effort which the European
allies make to the defence of the West, including the protection of their common
interests outside the NATO area. Since the security of each NATO member is
inextricably linked to that of the others, substantial European forces are
essential to the defence of the North American continent. There is no substitute
for the United States’ nuclear guarantee nor for North American forces stationed
in Europe in peacetime; but, of NATO’s ready forces in Europe, the European
allies provide about 90 per cent of the manpower, 80 per cent of combat aircraft,
85 per cent of tanks and 95 per cent of artillery, as well as 70 per cent of the
fighting ships in European and Atlantic waters. They also provide some 7
million men and women on active and reserve duties and are able to supply
around 900 military facilities for United States forces and essential support
requirements such as communications and transport.
Britain and its European allies recognise the value of co-operation and

organisations in Great Britain. It also gives the police powers to arrest people
suspected of being involved in terrorism (whether international or relating to
Northern Ireland) without warrant and hold them for 48 hours and. with the
approval of the Secretary of State, for up to a further five days. Both Acts have
been subject to independent review. The Emergency Provisions Act is renewable
every six months and the Prevention of Terrorism Act annually; the latter has a
total life of five years.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can be
prosecuted for criminal offences. Procedures for handling complaints against
the police involve two independent elements: the Director of Public Prosecutions
if allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the Police Complaints Board for
Northern Ireland when complaints relate only to disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 makes it possible to try in Northern
Ireland a person accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It
also enables evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences
in the Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic. One
of the aims of the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in November 1985 is to improve
security co-operation in combating terrorism. The accession of the Irish
Government to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in
1986 is expected to increase the prospects of securing extradition from the
Republic of people accused or convicted of terrorist crimes in Britain.
Britain attaches importance to international action to combat terrorism and
plays an active part in the work of a group of European Community ministers
(known as Trevi') which facilitates the confidential exchange of information and
intelligence about terrorism affecting member countries. Britain believes that
there should be no substantive concessions to terrorist demands and that
international co-operation should take place on tracking down and arresting
terrorists and on impeding the movement of international terrorists from one
country to another.
In enforcing the law, police action rests mainly upon common consent, for there
is only a small number of officers in relation to the population (roughly one
officer to every 400 or so people). Officers do not normally carry firearms (their
only weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police powers.
The powers of the police in England and Wales have been modernised and
clarified by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which at the same time
has enhanced safeguards for the citizen. The Act does not generally extend to
Scotland, where separate legislation applies.
The interception of communications on behalf of the police is regulated by the
Interception of Communications Act 1985, which establishes a statutory
framework governing the interception of messages in the telecommunications
and postal services and sets out the grounds on which certain Secretaries of
State are empowered to authorise interception. So far as the police are
concerned, these are the prevention and detection of serious crime, and, in some
instances, the protection of national security. The other ground for interception
is the safeguarding of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.
Interception outside the procedures established by the Act is a criminal offence.
Each of Britain's 52 police forces is responsible for law enforcement in its area,
but there is constant co-operation among them. In order to improve their
effectiveness, forces pay particular attention to ensuring that manpower and
other resources are used as efficiently as possible.
Outside London most counties (regions in Scotland) have their own police
forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined forces. The
policing of London is in the hands of the Metropolitan Police Force, with

by industry, leads to nationally recognised qualifications for large numbers of
Service personnel.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia Royal Naval
College, Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air
Force College, Cranwell. This is followed by specialist training, often including
degree courses at university or Service establishments. Higher training for
officers is provided by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, the Army Staff College
at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at Bracknell. Selected senior
officers and civilian officials from Britain and other countries attend the Joint
Services Defence College, Greenwich, and the Royal College of Defence Studies,
London, which provides the wider background necessary for those destined to
fill higher appointments.
Operational training includes joint-Service and inter-allied exercises. Train¬
ing is provided for the armed forces of allied. Commonwealth and other
countries.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. In addition
to supplementing the regular forces on mobilisation with trained personnel able
immediately to take their places either as formed units or as individual
reinforcements, they form an important link between the Services and the civil
community. Some members of these forces have a reserve liability following a
period of regular service (regular reserve); others are volunteers who train in
their spare time. Volunteer reserve forces include the Territorial Army, whose
role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to NATO and help to maintain a
secure home base in the United Kingdom; its strength is being increased over
the remainder of the decade. Set up in 1985, a Home Defence Force, linked to the
Territorial Army and with a planned strength of about 5,000 by 1990, would on
mobilisation assist in guarding important civilian and military installations.
Other volunteer forces include the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines
Reserve, the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the
Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. All have been expanded substantially in
recent years or are planned to increase in strength in the near future. The Ulster
Defence Regiment (see p 100) is also a reserve force. At the beginning of 1987
regular reserves totalled 217,900, and volunteer reserves and auxiliary forces
95,700. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to recruitment to
the regular forces, totalled 144,300.
The Royal Navy’s Polaris force comprises four nuclear submarines, each of which
can remain on underwater patrol for long periods and is capable of carrying 16
nuclear-armed Polaris missiles. The missile system, now incorporating improve¬
ments designed to penetrate anti-ballistic missile defences, will maintain
the force's effectiveness until it is replaced in the mid-1990s by a Trident nuclear
submarine force which will extend Britain’s nuclear deterrent into the twenty-
first century. The Trident programme, which will cost an estimated £9,265
million (at 1986-87 prices), is expected to account on average for about 3 per
cent of the defence budget (about 6 per cent of the equipment budget) during its
procurement period. It is also estimated that more than 60 per cent of the money
for the project will be spent in Britain. The first Trident submarine was ordered
in 1986.
Britain’s naval forces, while capable of operating throughout the world when
required, are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English Channel where
they constitute the majority of forces immediately available to NATO. They
include three Invincible-class anti-submarine warfare carriers, carrying Sea
King anti-submarine and airborne early warning helicopters. Sea Harrier
aircraft, and Sea Dart defence missile systems; 15 nuclear-powered attack
102

submarines (with another three under construction or on order) equipped with
torpedoes and the Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missile, and 13 diesel electric-
powered submarines, which will be replaced by the more powerful Upholder
class; and about 50 destroyers and frigates for air defence, anti-submarine and
general purpose duties. Most of these have weapon-carrying helicopters
(principally the Lynx), and armaments installed include the Exocet surface-to-
surface, Sea Wolf point air defence, Sea Dart area air defence and Sea Skua
anti-ship missile systems, and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapons
system. There is also an amphibious capability comprising two assault ships,
Fearless and Intrepid, supporting vessels and the Royal Marines. Other ships
include about 40 mine counter-measures vessels, including 11 of the new Hunt
and 12 of the River classes, and offshore patrol vessels for protecting fishing
interests and oil and gas installations.
In coming years Britain's contribution to NATO's maritime defence will be
based increasingly on an enhanced anti-submarine warfare element made up
principally of nuclear-powered attack submarines and advanced diesel-electric
conventional submarines, of which four have been ordered, one being under
construction; the Type 23 frigate (the first of four that have been ordered will
enter service in the early 1990s); and Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft, equipped
with Searchwater radar and armed with Harpoon anti-ship missiles and Sting
Ray anti-submarine torpedoes. In addition, the surface fleet is being streng¬
thened by 14 multi-role Type 22 frigates: eight are already in service and the
other six are being built. New or improved weapons will include the Harpoon
missile for the last four Type 22 and for the new Type 23 frigates, the Sea Eagle
anti-ship missile, the Goalkeeper close-in weapon system, and the Spearfish
torpedo for submarines. The vertically launched Sea Wolf point-defence and the
Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles are also being developed or improved.
Most of the Army’s combat forces, consisting of BAOR and the forces stationed
in Britain, have primary roles in support of NATO. Others are stationed overseas
in support of treaty commitments.
All three armoured divisions in BAOR are equipped with the Chieftain or
Challenger main battle tanks. Seven of the 12 regiments in Europe will be
equipped with Challenger. The war maintenance reserve will be strengthened
with some of the Chieftains replaced in the front line by Challengers.
Improvements for both tanks will be the fitting of thermal imaging sights and
new 120-mm high-pressure guns. Tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles
include the Scorpion light tank with a 76-mm gun. Scimitar with a 30-mm
cannon and Striker which mounts the Swingfire long-range anti-tank missile.
The primary tracked armoured personnel carrier is the FV432. The continuing
purchase of the Saxon armoured personnel carrier and the introduction of the
Warrior mechanised combat vehicle will increase the mobility of infantry. The
crew-portable Milan anti-tank missile is deployed throughout BAOR (front-line
and all regular and Territorial Army reinforcing battalions) and will be joined
shortly by the man-portable light anti-tank weapon, LAW80. Lynx helicopters
are fitted with an improved TOW long-range anti-tank weapon. The multiple-
launched rocket system will enter service at the end of the decade. Tactical
nuclear support is provided by the Lance missile and dual-capable artillery.
Integral air defence is based on the Rapier missile, improved tracked versions of
which are being introduced, the Starstreak missile and the Javelin man-
portable missile, a development of the Blowpipe missile which it is replacing.
Important improvements in command, control and communications systems
include the PTARMIGAN secure communication and the WAVELL computerised
information systems now entering service in BAOR; a computer-based artillery
targeting system (BATES) is planned to enter service by the end of the 1980s.

Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, provide Britain’s air defence, assisted by Shackleton
airborne early warning aircraft and the ground radars of the United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment system. The Tornado GR1 has replaced Jaguars
and Vulcans in the strike/attack role and will, in due course, replace some
Jaguars in the reconnaissance role. Harrier GR3s provide close air support to
ground troops. Nimrod maritime aircraft form part of Britain’s anti-submarine
warfare capability, and also undertake long-range surveillance operations
against surface ships, offshore surveillance and fishery protection. Improved
Buccaneers, armed with Sea Eagle and Martel missiles, are employed in an
anti-ship role. Victor and converted Hercules, TriStar and VC 10 aircraft are used
as tankers for in-flight refuelling. Tactical transport is provided by VC 10 and
Hercules aircraft, medium and light support being given by Chinook, Puma and
Wessex helicopters. Sea King and Wessex helicopters perform search and rescue
duties around the British Isles. Weapons in service include Skyflash, Sparrow,
Sidewinder, Martel and Sea Eagle missiles, and guided and cluster bombs.
The Royal Air Force is undergoing a comprehensive re-equipment programme.
Improvements to Britain’s air defences include seven squadrons of the Tornado
F3, which are soon to start replacing Lightning and some Phantom squadrons;
and replacement or modernisation of the radars and command, control and
communications systems for the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environ¬
ment. In addition, 72 Hawk trainer aircraft have been equipped with air-to-air
missiles and cannon for local air defence.
The Government has decided that in the 1990s airborne early warning for
Britain’s air defence will be provided by Boeing ESA aircraft purchased from the
United States. The air-to-air refuelling capability is being increased by the entry
into service of converted VC 10s and TriStars in the tanker role. The Tornado
GR1 has enhanced the offensive power of the Royal Air Force as will the new
Harrier GR5s, which are to be delivered from 1988 to replace the Harrier GR3. All
strike/attack and offensive support aircraft will be installed with advanced
electronic warfare equipment to increase their ability to survive, and the
Tornado GR1, already being equipped with the British JP233 airfield attack
weapon, will have the anti-radiation missile (ALARM) and a Sky Shadow pod
carrying electronic counter-measures equipment. The RAF’s support helicopter
fleet will also be modernised.
Defence Procurement
Responsibility for providing the armed forces with the equipment they need lies
with the Ministry of Defence's Procurement Executive. About 45 per cent of the
defence budget will be spent on equipment in 1987—88, making the Ministry
British industry’s largest customer. The Procurement Executive works with the
Service users and industry to obtain the best long-term value over a project’s life,
from concept formulation (drawing on the research programme) through
development and production to in-Service support. Where possible, work is
placed with industry under firm-price contracts won through competition.
Research is undertaken by the Ministry's research establishments, which have a
very wide technological capability. The Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. Around £401 million is
expected to be spent on defence research and £1,945 million on development in
1987—88. Nearly all design and development of defence equipment is carried out
by industry. The Ministry is also increasingly seeking to involve industry in the
planning of the research programme and to promote civil applications. As part of
the Government’s policy of improving the strength of Britain’s science base, the

Ministry, together with the research councils, is funding a series of joint
ventures with academic institutions in areas of strategic research.
Britain and other NATO countries are participating in the United States’
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), which was set up in 1983 to determine the
feasibility of establishing an effective defence against ballistic missile attack. In
1985 Britain and the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding to
promote British participation, and an SDI Participation Office in the Ministry of
Defence was formed to work in close concert with British firms and institutions.
British participation in the SDI programme, valued at $34 million by the end of
1986, is intended to enhance Britain’s research in areas of high technology
relevant to both defence and civil programmes.
International co-operation has been a feature of armaments procurement for
over 20 years, and Britain was one of its pioneers in programmes such as the
Anglo-French Jaguar and Lynx/Puma/Gazelle helicopter package; the FH70
towed howitzer developed jointly with the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy;
and the highly successful Tornado aircraft developed and produced with the
same two partners. Britain also worked with the United States on the Harrier
GR5/AV8B programme.
In recent years there has been a growing recognition that more, and more
systematic, collaboration will be necessary for the future if Britain and its
Alliance partners are to eliminate wasteful duplication of effort and make better
use of limited resources. Britain is playing an active role in the promotion of
such co-operation in forums such as NATO, the Conference of National
Armaments Directors, and the Independent European Programme Group.
Major new programmes under way as part of this process include the EH 101
helicopter (with Italy), the new European Fighter Aircraft (the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy and Spain), and the Multi-Rocket Launch System (with
France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the United States).
In accordance with its plans to introduce private capital into the company, the
Government sold Royal Ordnance pic to British Aerospace pic in April 1987. The
same principles were behind the Government’s decision to introduce from 1987
commercial management to two of the Royal Dockyards, at Devonport and
Rosyth, which carry out most of the refitting and repair of Royal Navy ships.
Sales of British defence equipment enable allies and friendly governments to
take advantage of Britain’s extensive research and development programmes to
improve their own defence. The Defence Export Services Organisation of the
Ministry of Defence provides a wide range of assistance to industry in promoting
equipment and negotiating contracts with overseas customers. This includes
collecting market information, demonstrating equipment, providing expert
military advice, training and support, staging exhibitions and negotiating
with overseas governments. Government and private companies employ Inter¬
national Military Services Ltd to obtain and carry out export contracts for
British defence equipment and associated services. Britain is one of the West’s
top three defence exporters. In 1986 defence exports were worth around £5,800
million, an increase of 100 per cent over 1985. Such orders continue to
maintain more than 100,000 jobs.
Civil Defence
Civil defence arrangements are based on the extended and adapted use of the
peacetime resources of government departments, local authorities, emergency
DEFENCE

services and nationalised industries, supplemented by the efforts of voluntary
organisations and individual volunteers. Civil defence regulations introduced in
1983 require local authorities to make and keep up to date plans for a range of
essential functions in the event of war; to arrange training and exercises for civil
defence staff and volunteers; and to provide suitable emergency centres for
direction of civil defence in wartime. Following legislation in 1986, local
authorities may use their civil defence resources in responding to peacetime
emergencies.
Expenditure on civil defence has been growing steadily and was nearly £98
million in 1986-87. This is being used to improve the quality and readiness of
central and local government planning; increase training opportunities
arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines at the Civil Defence College,
Easingwold; help local authorities to plan for better community involvement in
civil defence; and improve the emergency system for decentralised government
control and communications. Improvements are also being made in the
communications, equipment and administrative facilities of the United King¬
dom Warning and Monitoring Organisation. This includes the civilian Royal
Observer Corps, which is organised to provide public warning of an attack, of
the location and strength of nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level
of radioactive fall-out.
5 Justice and the
Law
The Law
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland all have their own legal systems and law courts. There is
substantial similarity on many points, but considerable differences remain in
law, organisation and practice. In Northern Ireland procedure closely resembles
that of England and Wales but there are often differences in enacted law.
However, a large volume of modern legislation applies throughout the United
Kingdom and there is a common distinction between criminal law, concerned
with wrongful acts harmful to the community, and civil law, concerned with
individuals’ rights, duties and obligations towards one another.
The main sources of law are legislation, common law and European
Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament, Orders (rules and
regulations made by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament) and
by-laws made by local government or other authorities exercising powers
conferred by Parliament. Common law, the ancient law of the land deduced from
custom and interpreted in court cases by the judges, has never been precisely
defined or codified but forms the basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. European Community law is confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes precedence over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most authoritative rulings are
given by the European Court of Justice.
Certain changes to United Kingdom law have been enacted as a result of
rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in particular cases where the
domestic law was in breach of the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which the United Kingdom is a
party.
Criminal Justice
The Government's strategy for dealing with crime is to sustain the rule of law by
preventing crime where possible; to detect culprits when crimes are committed;
to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent; to deal firmly, adequately and
sensibly with those found guilty; and to provide more effective support for the
victims of crime. It is also concerned with ensuring that public confidence in the
criminal justice system is maintained and that a proper balance between the
rights of the citizen and the needs of the community as a whole is maintained.
With continuing concern in Britain, as in many other countries, over rising
crime rates, public expenditure on the law and order programme reflects the
special priority given by the Government to these services. Recent increases have
been made to cover, in particular, greater police manpower, the probation
service and extra spending on prison building. More than two-thirds of total
expenditure is initially incurred by local authorities (with the help of central
government grants), mainly on the police service.
A number of measures to strengthen the criminal justice system have been
taken. The Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 provides for the pre-trial freezing
108
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Criminal
Law
Crime Statistics
of suspected drug traffickers' assets, backed up on conviction by immediate
confiscation of the assets to the value of the proceeds of the crime; similar
provisions are included in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill before Parlia¬
ment. The Public Order Act 1986 codifies the common law offences of riot,
unlawful assembly and affray; enhances the powers of the police to control
public processions and assemblies likely to result in serious disorder or
disruption; strengthens the law against incitement to racial hatred; and
provides additional powers to combat football hooliganism. The Criminal
Justice Act 1987 provides for the creation of a Serious Fraud Office and
streamlined court procedures to deal with cases of fraud. Further government
proposals for England and Wales include an extended scheme for confiscation of
the proceeds of profitable crimes and changes in the jury system. Government
proposals regarding improved arrangements for compensating victims of crime
and for reform of the law on extradition would apply to Great Britain.
The criminal law, like the law generally, is interpreted by the courts but changes
in the law are matters for Parliament. In practice most legislation affecting
criminal law is government-sponsored, but there is usually consultation
between government departments and the legal profession, the police, the
probation service (in Scotland, the social work agencies) and voluntary bodies.
Chief constables in England and Wales must supply statistics relating to
offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their areas.
Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) appears in the
annual reports of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for London)
the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements operate in
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Differences in the legal systems, police recording practices and statistical
classifications in the countries of the United Kingdom make it impracticable to
analyse in detail trends in crime for the country as a whole. Nevertheless, it is
clear that, as in Western Europe generally, there has been a substantial increase
in crime since the early 1950s. However, official statistics cover only crime
recorded by the police and may thus be affected by changes in the proportion of
crimes which are undiscovered or unreported. The level of police manning and
deployment of the force may also affect recording.
Table 4 shows the rate of notifiable offences recorded by the police in England
and Wales in 1986. These figures indicate a 7 per cent increase over the previous

year. Some 95 per cent of crime is against property, much of this being relatively
small scale. This reinforces the need, in the Government’s view, to encourage the
development of crime prevention schemes.
The number of notifiable offences recorded by the police in England and Wales
in 1986 was 3 -8 million,1 of which 32 per cent were cleared up. Clear-up rates for
certain very serious offences were much higher—90 per cent for homicide and
70 per cent for violence against the person and for sexual offences. The Scottish
police recorded 463,837 crimes, of which 34 per cent were cleared up.
A wide range of research into criminal and social policies is carried out by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Research is also
carried out in university departments, much of it financed by the Government.
The principal university criminological research establishment is the Institute
of Criminology at Cambridge.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides compensation to victims
of violent crimes (including violence within the family), to people hurt while
trying to arrest offenders and prevent offences and to those bereaved as a result
of violence. Compensation is assessed on the basis of common law damages and
usually takes the form of a lump-sum payment. In 1985—86, just under 30,000
cases were resolved by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and over £41
million was paid in compensation. Under proposals before Parliament, the
courts’ powers to make compensation orders would be extended and the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme would be established on a statutory
basis, thereby ensuring that for the first time victims would be entitled to
compensation as of right.
In Northern Ireland there is separate, statutory provision in certain circum¬
stances for compensation from public funds for criminal injuries, and for
malicious damage to property including the resulting losses of profits.
There has been a rapid growth in the number of locally run victim support
schemes which offer practical help to the victims of crime on a voluntaiy basis.
The Government provides financial assistance, both to local schemes and to a
national association.
Legislation to protect the public against terrorism has given the authorities
certain exceptional powers for dealing with and preventing terrorist activities. It
is embodied in two Acts of Parliament which take account of the need to achieve
a proper balance between the safety of the public and the rights of the
individual. While acknowledging that the special powers make inroads into civil
liberties the Government believes that they should continue in force as long as a
substantial terrorist threat remains. Nobody can be imprisoned for political
beliefs; all prisoners, except those awaiting trial, have been found guilty in court
of criminal offences.
The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (first introduced in
1973), which is in force in Northern Ireland, provides the security forces with
special powers to search, question and arrest suspected terrorists; allows the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to proscribe terrorist organisations and
provides for certain serious offences to be tried by a judge sitting alone without a
jury to obviate the dangers of intimidation of jurors. The Prevention of
Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 (first introduced in 1974), which is
applicable throughout the United Kingdom, provides for the exclusion from
Great Britain, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom of people connected with
terrorism related to Northern Ireland affairs and for the proscription of terrorist
Excluding 'other criminal damage' valued at £20 and under.

organisations in Great Britain. It also gives the police powers to arrest people
suspected of being involved in terrorism (whether international or relating to
Northern Ireland) without warrant and hold them for 48 hours and, with the
approval of the Secretary of State, for up to a further five days. Both Acts have
been subject to independent review. The Emergency Provisions Act is renewable
every six months and the Prevention of Terrorism Act annually; the latter has a
total life of five years.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can be
prosecuted for criminal offences. Procedures for handling complaints against
the police involve two independent elements: the Director of Public Prosecutions
if allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the Police Complaints Board for
Northern Ireland when complaints relate only to disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 makes it possible to try in Northern
Ireland a person accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It
also enables evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences
in the Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic. One
of the aims of the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in November 1985 is to improve
security co-operation in combating terrorism. The accession of the Irish
Government to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in
1986 is expected to increase the prospects of securing extradition from the
Republic of people accused or convicted of terrorist crimes in Britain.
Britain attaches importance to international action to combat terrorism and
plays an active part in the work of a group of European Community ministers
(known as ‘Trevi’) which facilitates the confidential exchange of information and
intelligence about terrorism affecting member countries. Britain believes that
there should be no substantive concessions to terrorist demands and that
international co-operation should take place on tracking down and arresting
terrorists and on impeding the movement of international terrorists from one
country to another.
In enforcing the law, police action rests mainly upon common consent, for there
is only a small number of officers in relation to the population (roughly one
officer to every 400 or so people). Officers do not normally carry firearms (their
only weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police powers.
The powers of the police in England and Wales have been modernised and
clarified by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which at the same time
has enhanced safeguards for the citizen. The Act does not generally extend to
Scotland, where separate legislation applies.
The interception of communications on behalf of the police is regulated by the
Interception of Communications Act 1985, which establishes a statutory
framework governing the interception of messages in the telecommunications
and postal services and sets out the grounds on which certain Secretaries of
State are empowered to authorise interception. So far as the police are
concerned, these are the prevention and detection of serious crime, and, in some
instances, the protection of national security. The other ground for interception
is the safeguarding of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.
Interception outside the procedures established by the Act is a criminal offence.
Each of Britain's 52 police forces is responsible for law enforcement in its area,
but there is constant co-operation among them. In order to improve their
effectiveness, forces pay particular attention to ensuring that manpower and
other resources are used as efficiently as possible.
Outside London most counties (regions in Scotland) have their own police
forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined forces. The
policing of London is in the hands of the Metropolitan Police Force, with

headquarters at New Scotland Yard, and the City of London force. The strength
of the regular police in Great Britain at the end of 1986 was nearly 135,000
(including over 12,500 policewomen); in Northern Ireland the strength of the
regular Royal Ulster Constabulary was 12,665, including over 4,420 full- and
part-time members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve. The strength of the
Metropolitan Police Force was over 26,900. It is recognised that the composition
of the police forces should reflect the make-up of a multiracial society and efforts
are being made to encourage more members of the ethnic minorities to join
them.
Each regular police force is maintained by a police authority. In England and
Wales, these are committees of local councillors and magistrates, and in
Scotland, they are the regional and islands councils. The police authority for the
Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary. In Northern Ireland the police
authority is appointed by the Secretary of State.
The police authority’s functions, some subject to ministerial approval, include
appointing the chief constable, deputy chief constable and assistant chief
constables; fixing the maximum permitted strength of the force; and providing
buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the commissioner of
police and his immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation of
the Home Secretary. The police authorities are financed by central and local
government.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below assistant
chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authorities on
matters of efficiency, and must submit a report every year.
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administration and operation of
the police service. They approve the appointment of chief, deputy and assistant
chief constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable in
the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on matters
relating to local policing or institute a local inquiry. They can make regulations
covering such matters as police ranks; qualifications for appointment, promo¬
tion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and
uniform. Some of these regulations are first negotiable within the Police
Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom, which has an independent chairman
and representatives of the police authorities, police staff associations and the
home departments. Matters of a non-negotiable kind and general questions are
discussed by the Police Advisory Boards.
All police forces (except the Metropolitan Police, for which the Home Secretary
is directly responsible) are subject to inspection by inspectors of constabulary
reporting to the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland or the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Inspectors maintain close touch with the
forces they inspect and have advisory functions.
A British police officer is not employed by or under the direction of the police
authority or of the Government, and may be sued or prosecuted for any wrongful
act committed in carrying out duties. Statutory procedures, normally including
an independent element, govern the way in which complaints are handled. The
establishment of the new independent Police Complaints Authority, with powers
to supervise the investigation of any serious complaint against a police officer,
has substantially reformed the complaints system in England and Wales. In
Scotland, complaints against police officers involving allegations of any form of
112
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Common
Services
criminal conduct are investigated by independent public prosecutors. The 1985
Police Discipline Code is designed to prevent any abuse of the considerable
powers enjoyed by a police officer, to ensure the impartiality of the service in its
dealings with the public and to maintain public confidence.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or street
patrolling (the trend is increasingly away from the car patrol and back to
‘community’ policing on foot) and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal
investigation and arresting offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police
officers have to deal with social problems and may bring in other social agencies
and expert help.
Because the police force attaches great importance to developing and
maintaining the trust and the confidence of the community, most forces have
community liaison departments to co-ordinate their efforts to produce good
relations with the community. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
requires arrangements to be made for obtaining the views of people in the area
about the policing of it and for obtaining their co-operation with the police in
preventing crime. Almost all areas have police/community consultative groups
which enable people to discuss issues of concern with the police in a
constructive spirit. Particular efforts are made to develop relations with young
people, through greater contact with schools, for example. Emphasis is also
placed on relations with ethnic minorities; racially discriminatory behaviour by
police officers is an offence under the Police Discipline Code, and training in
community relations is available to officers.
To release as many uniformed police officers as possible for operational duties,
police authorities employ over 41,800 civilians (including part-time employees)
in England and Wales and over 2,300 in Scotland. The number of civilian
support staff has been growing as forces secure economies by replacing police
officers with civilians where posts do not require police powers and training.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are nearly 4,800 in England and Wales and
about 540 in Scotland) carry out specified duties concerned with traffic and
parking. Wardens are under the control of the chief constable.
Each force has an attachment of volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without pay, acting mainly as auxiliaries to the
regular force. In Northern Ireland there is a part-time and full-time paid reserve.
Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, however, have
their own staff associations to represent their interests.
A number of common services are provided by central government departments
and by arrangements between forces. The most important are: training services;
a Forensic Science Service in England and Wales (the Metropolitan Police
maintains its own laboratory); telecommunications services which provide
police radio equipment; and central and provincial criminal records available to
all forces. Regional crime squad teams of detectives from several forces
investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one police area; all
squads have detectives who specialise in investigating major drug trafficking
organisations. The Scottish Crime Squad assists forces in crime investigation
and prevention.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropolitan
Police. The National Drugs Intelligence Unit assists police forces and the
Customs service throughout Britain. The services of the Fraud Squad, run
jointly by the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police to investigate
company frauds, are available in England and Wales.'

information.
In England and Wales arrests may be made with and without a warrant issued
by a magistrate. The police may arrest a person without a warrant under the
arrest scheme established by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which
provides a general conditional power to arrest a person reasonably suspected of
any offence. However, a person can only be arrested under the scheme if it is
necessary in order to ensure that he (or she) can be brought before a court (for
example, because of failure to give a satisfactory address for service of a
summons or in order to prevent injury to persons or property). Furthermore, the
Act categorises certain offences as ‘arrestable’ or ‘serious arrestable’ and
provides a full power of arrest without warrant in respect of them for the
protection of the public.
A code of practice on detention, treatment and questioning is one of four codes
which the Home Secretary has issued under the 1984 Act. Failure to comply
with the provisions of these codes can render a police officer liable to disciplinary
proceedings.
An arrested person has a statutory right to consult a solicitor and to ask the
police to notify a named person likely to take an interest in his or her welfare
about the arrest. Where a person has been arrested in connection with a serious
arrestable offence, but has not yet been charged, the police may delay the
exercise of these rights in the interests of the investigation if certain criteria are
met. The police must caution a person whom there are grounds to suspect of an
offence before any questions are put for the purpose of obtaining evidence.
Questions relating to an offence may normally not be put to a person after he or
she has been charged with that offence or informed that he or she may be
prosecuted for it.
The detention scheme in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act provides for a
person to be detained only if, and for as long as, necessary for a purpose
specified by law up to a maximum of 96 hours before charge. A person can only
be detained beyond 36 hours if a warrant is obtained from a magistrates’ court.
Reviews must be made of a person’s detention (whether before or after charge)
at regular intervals to check whether the criteria for detention are still satisfied.
If they are not, the person must be released immediately.
As a practical means of developing public confidence in the treatment of
people detained by the police, the Government is encouraging the establishment
of schemes whereby lay visitors make random checks on the interrogation and
detention of suspects in police stations.
A person who thinks that the grounds for detention are unlawful1 may apply
to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained
him or her, requiring the person to appear before the court to justify the
detention. An application for this writ is normally made by the person detained
or by someone acting on his or her behalf. Similar procedures apply in Northern
Ireland.
As soon as there is sufficient evidence to charge a person, the police must decide
on an appropriate method of dealing with him or her. As an alternative to
charging immediately, they can, for example, decide to defer charging, to
caution, to deal with the matter by summons or to take no further action and
1 Detention is lawful in pursuance of criminal justice, for contempt of court or of either House of
Parliament and when expressly authorised by Parliament. It is also sometimes lawful in the case
of the mentally disordered.

release the person with or without bail. Where an immediate charge is
appropriate the person may continue to be held in custody if the name or
address furnished is considered suspect, if there are grounds for believing that
detention is necessary for his or her own protection, to prevent harm to people or
property, or if there is a risk that the person would otherwise fail to appear in
court or could interfere with the administration of justice. When no such
considerations apply, the person must be released with or without bail
depending on the circumstances of the case. Where a person is detained after
charge, there is provision in the Act for him or her to be brought before a
magistrates’ court quickly. This will usually be no later than the following day.
Under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 there is provision for statutory
time limits on the period from arrest to the beginning of trial in England and
Wales: from April 1987 such limits were introduced in three police authority
areas and it is hoped that they will be extended to the rest of the two countries by
the end of 1987.
It is for the court to decide, under the provisions of the Bail Act 1976, whether
an accused person in criminal proceedings should be released on bail. A court
may only withhold bail in certain specified circumstances, for instance, if the
court has substantial grounds for believing that the accused person would
abscond, commit an offence, interfere with witnesses, or otherwise obstruct the
course of justice if released on bail. A court may also impose conditions before
granting bail. If bail is refused, the defendant may apply to a High Court judge or
to the Crown Court for bail, and application can be made to the Crown Court for
conditions imposed by a magistrates’ court to be varied. The majority of people
remanded by magistrates are given bail.
In Scotland, the police may detain and question a suspected person for a period
of up to six hours. Thereafter the person must either be released or charged. An
arrest must be accompanied by a criminal charge. Once a person has been
charged there is little scope for questioning and only voluntary statements will
normally be allowed in evidence at the trial. The court will reject statements
unless satisfied that they have been fairly obtained. Anyone arrested must be
brought before a court with the least possible delay (generally not later than the
first day after being taken into custody), or—in less serious cases—liberated by
the police, often on a written undertaking to attend court on a specified date.
Where a prosecution on indictment is intended (that is, where an accusation of a
more serious offence is to be made), the accused is brought before the sheriff to
be committed, either for further examination or until liberated in due course of
law. A judicial examination may take place. Eight days may elapse between
commitment for further examination and commitment until liberated in due
course of law. The latter—which is also described as ‘full committal’—is
commitment for trial. No evidence needs to be presented to the sheriff for such
commitment. Anyone accused of a crime, except murder or treason, is entitled to
apply for release on bail. Even in cases of murder or treason, bail may be granted
at the discretion of the Lord Advocate or a quorum of the High Court. Money bail
has been virtually abolished and the courts, or the Lord Advocate, may release an
accused person on conditions.
Breach of any of the conditions without reasonable excuse is a separate
offence. There is a right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person
against the refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either party against the conditions imposed. The writ of habeas corpus does not
apply in Scotland but if a person is to be prosecuted on indictment and has been
kept in custody pending trial, the trial must begin within 110 days of the date of
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

full committal. The trial of a person charged with a summary offence and held in
custody must begin within 40 days.
The initial decision to bring a charge normally lies, in England and Wales, with
the police. Responsibility for the case is then handed over to a Crown Prosecutor
who takes an independent decision; he may drop the charge or add to or vary it
and is responsible for conducting the case through the courts. In Scotland,
public prosecutors (procurators fiscal) decide whether or not to begin proceed¬
ings. In Northern Ireland there is a Director of Public Prosecutions. In England
and Wales (and exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute
criminal proceedings. Police may issue cautions and in Scotland the procurator
fiscal may warn, instead of prosecuting.
Legislation has been passed to establish a Serious Fraud Office in England
and Wales, under the Attorney General, with a wide-ranging remit to investigate
and prosecute the most serious and complex frauds. In Scotland there is a
Serious Fraud Unit in the Crown Office.
The new Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales established by the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 is headed by the Director of Public Prosecu¬
tions under the superintendence of the Attorney General. The Director appoints
chief Crown prosecutors—for the most part covering a police force area—who
deal with the vast majority of cases in consultation with the police, who
investigate, and the courts, who hear the cases. The Service is responsible for
providing advocates to present cases in magistrates’ courts and briefs barristers
to appear on its behalf in the Crown Court. While the decision to prosecute is
delegated, as far as possible, to the local level, certain categories of cases are
referrable to the Director of Public Prosecutions; these include large and
complex fraud, obscene publications and exhibitions, and allegations affecting
police officers.
While much of the prosecution work at the Central Criminal Court in London
is conducted by a team of Treasury Counsel appointed by the Attorney General,
experienced barristers are also nominated from time to time to lead a member of
the Treasury team.
Discharging his duties through the Crown Office, the Lord Advocate is
responsible for prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary, sheriff courts and
district courts. There is no general right of private prosecution; with a few minor
exceptions crimes and offences may be prosecuted only by the Lord Advocate or
his deputes or by the procurators fiscal, who are the Lord Advocate’s local
officials. The permanent adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is
the Crown Agent, who is head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted in
the Crown Office by a staff of legally qualified civil servants, all of whom have had
experience as depute procurators fiscal. Prosecutions in the High Court are
prepared by procurators fiscal and Crown Office officials and prosecuted by the
Lord Advocate, the Solicitor-General for Scotland (the Lord Advocate’s minis¬
terial deputy) and advocates depute who are collectively known as Crown
Counsel. Crimes tried before the sheriff and district courts are prepared and
prosecuted by procurators fiscal. The police and other law enforcement agencies
investigate crimes and offences and report to the procurator fiscal, who decides
whether or not to prosecute, subject to the directions of Crown Counsel.
Under a new system to be brought into force in Scotland a procurator fiscal
will be able to make a conditional offer of fixed penalty to an alleged offender in
respect of certain minor offences as an alternative to prosecution; the offender
will not be obliged to accept such an offer but if he or she does so the prosecution
loses the right to prosecute.

The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible to
the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment, and may do so
in summary cases of a serious nature. Other summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Magistrates’ courts dispose of about 95 per cent of criminal cases in England
and Wales, and conduct preliminary investigations into more serious offences,
which go to the Crown Court for trial. The Crown Court, situated in a number of
towns and cities, takes all criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts
and trials are held before a jury.
Magistrates’ courts hear and determine cases for which jury trial is not
required. There are about 700 magistrates’ courts in England and Wales and
27,710 magistrates (‘justices of the peace’, JPs). These are made up of about 60
full-time, legally qualified stipendiary magistrates, and some 27,650 unpaid lay
magistrates. Magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor except in
Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, where appointments are made
by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Stipendiary magistrates may sit
alone and usually preside in courts in urban areas where the workload is heavy.
Otherwise a court normally consists of three lay magistrates who are advised on
points of law and procedure by a legally qualified clerk who is also in charge of
the court’s administrative arrangements. When the clerk to the justices is not in
court, the magistrates are advised by a qualified assistant.
Magistrates’ courts try people charged with summary offences (the least
serious offences that can only be disposed of by magistrates) and people charged
with ‘either way’ offences where summary trial seems to the court appropriate
and the defendant agrees. Courts also conduct committal proceedings in the
case of people charged with indictable offences and with either way offences not
tried by them.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court to which the public and press are
admitted. They cannot impose a sentence of more than six months’ imprison¬
ment nor a fine exceeding £2,000. If an offence carries a higher maximum
penalty, they may commit the defendant for sentence at the Crown Court if they
consider their own power inadequate.
Cases involving people under 17 are heard in juvenile courts. These are
specially constituted magistrates’ courts which either sit apart from other
courts or are held at a different time. Only limited categories of people may be
present and press reports must not identify any juvenile appearing either as a
defendant or a witness. Where a young person under 17 is charged jointly with
someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in an ordinary magistrates’ court or the
Crown Court. If the young person is found guilty, the court may transfer the
case to a juvenile court for sentence unless satisfied that it is undesirable to
do so.
The Crown Court deals with trials of the more serious cases, the sentencing of
offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals from
magistrates' courts. It sits at about 90 centres and is presided over by High
Court judges, full-time ‘circuit judges' and part-time recorders. All contested
trials take place before a jury. Magistrates sit with a circuit judge or recorder to
deal with appeals and committals for sentence.
The Government is planning to alter court procedures regarding cases of
serious or complex fraud with a view to by-passing full committal proceedings in
magistrates' courts at the discretion of the prosecution, but with a special
procedure under which the accused would be able to apply to the Crown Court to
be discharged on the ground that there was no case to answer.
The Crown Court may impose on a convicted offender a fine either limited by
the statutory maximum, or where there is no statutory maximum, of unlimited

amount, and, within the permitted statutory maximum, any other custodial or
non-custodial penalty.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court
against the sentence imposed if he has pleaded guilty; or against the conviction
or sentence imposed if he has not pleaded guilty. Where the appeal is on a point
of law, either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’
court to the High Court (see p 127). Appeals from the Crown Court, either
against conviction or against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal
(Criminal Division). A further appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of
Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the Lords that the point is
one that ought to be considered by the House. A prosecutor or defendant may
appeal to the Lords from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his or her consent. Under the Criminal Justice Bill
before Parliament the Attorney General would be empowered, where he
considered that a sentence passed by the Crown Court raised a matter of public
importance, to refer the case to the Court of Appeal and the Court would give its
opinion on the principles to be observed in sentencing similar cases in the
future; the sentence in the original case would not be affected.
In Scotland the High Court of Justiciary tries such crimes as murder, treason
and rape; the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences and the
district court with minor offences. Criminal cases are heard either under solemn
procedure, when proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a
jury of 15 members, or under summary procedure, when the judge sits without a
jury. All cases in the High Court and the more serious ones in sheriff courts are
tried by a judge and jury. Summary procedure is used in the less serious cases in
the sheriff courts, and in all cases in the district courts. District courts are the
administrative responsibility of the district and the islands local government
authorities. The judges are lay justices of the peace; the local authorities may
appoint up to one-quarter of their elected members to be ex-officio justices. In
Glasgow there are four stipendiary magistrates who are full-time salaried
lawyers and have equivalent criminal jurisdiction to a sheriff sitting under
summary procedure. Children under 16 who have committed an offence or are
for other reasons specified in statute considered to need compulsory care may be
brought before a children’s hearing comprising three members of the local
community (see p 125).
Scotland's six sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court districts, each
of which has one or more sheriffs, who are the judges of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary, Scotland’s supreme criminal court, is both a
trial and an appeal court. Any of the following judges is entitled to try cases in
the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the Lord
Justice Clerk (the judge next in seniority) or one of the Lord Commissioners of
Justiciary. The main seat of the court is in Edinburgh, although the High Court
also tries cases in other towns.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court in Edinburgh. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sentence,
or both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside a conviction. There is
no further appeal to the House of Lords. In summary proceedings the prosecutor
may appeal on a point of law against acquittal or sentence. The Lord Advocate
118
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern
Ireland
Trial
may seek the opinion of the High Court on a point of law which has arisen in a
case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
The structure of Northern Ireland courts is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales. The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor cases is
carried out by magistrates’ courts presided over by a full-time, legally qualified
resident magistrate. Young offenders under 17 and young people under 17 who
need care, protection and control are dealt with by juvenile courts consisting of
the resident magistrate and two lay members (at least one of whom must be a
woman) specially qualified to deal with juveniles. Appeals from magistrates’
courts are heard by the county court.
The Crown Court deals with criminal trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Proceedings are heard before a single judge, and
all contested cases, other than those involving offences specified under
emergency legislation, take place before a jury. Appeals from the Crown Court
against conviction or sentence are heard by the Northern Ireland Court of
Appeal. Procedures for a further appeal to the House of Lords are similar to those
in England and Wales.
Criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between the
prosecution and the defence. Since the law presumes the innocence of an
accused person until guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any
advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant (in Scotland, called
an accused) has the right to employ a legal adviser and may be granted legal aid
from public funds. If remanded in custody, the person may be visited by a legal
adviser to ensure a properly prepared defence. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland during the preparation of the case, the prosecution usually tells the
defence of relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and
discloses them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also inform the defence
of witnesses whose evidence may help the accused and whom the prosecution
does not propose to call. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the
defendant’s mental state renders him or her unfit to be tried. If the jury (or in
Scotland, the judge) decides that this is so, the defendant is admitted to a
specified hospital.
Criminal trials are normally in open court and rules of evidence (concerned
with the proof of facts) are rigorously applied. If evidence is improperly admitted,
a conviction can be quashed on appeal. During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution, normally
through a lawyer; to call his or her own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court in
person or through a lawyer, the defence having the right to the last speech at the
trial. The defendant cannot be questioned without consenting to be sworn as a
witness in his or her own defence. When he or she does testify, cross-
examination about character or other conduct may be made only in exceptional
circumstances; generally the prosecution may not introduce such evidence.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the Criminal Justice Act 1987
provides that in complex fraud cases there should be a preparatory open Crown
Court hearing at which the judge will be able to hear and settle points of law and
to define the issues to be put to the jury.
In jury trials the judge decides questions of law, sums up the evidence for the
jury and instructs it on the relevant law, and discharges the accused or passes
sentence. Only the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. In
England and Wales, if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may

direct it to bring in a majority verdict provided that, in the normal jury of 12
people, there are not more than two dissentients. In Scotland, where the jury
consists of 15 people, the verdict may be reached by a simple majority, but as a
general rule, no person may be convicted without corroborated evidence. If the
jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’ (or in Scotland ‘not proven’, which is an
alternative verdict of acquittal), the prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If ‘guilty’ the defendant
has a right of appeal to the appropriate court. A jury is completely independent
of the judiciary. Once members are sworn in, they are protected from all
interference.
Although the right of the defence to challenge up to three potential members of
a jury without giving any reason is to be abolished in England and Wales, it will
remain open to both parties to challenge potential jurors by giving reasons
where they believe that an individual juror is likely to be biased.
People between the ages of 18 and 65 whose names appear on the electoral
register, with certain exceptions, are liable for jury service and their names are
chosen at random. (Proposals to increase the upper age limit from 65 to 70 have
been announced for England and Wales.) Ineligible persons include the
judiciary, priests, people who have within the previous ten years been members
of the legal profession, the Lord Chancellor’s Department, or the police, prison
and probation services, and certain sufferers from mental illness. Persons
disqualified from jury service include those who have, within the previous ten
years, served any part of a sentence of imprisonment, youth custody or
detention, or been subject to a community service order, or, within the previous
five years, been placed on probation. Anyone who has been sentenced to five or
more years’ imprisonment is disqualified for life.
Coroners investigate violent and unnatural deaths or sudden deaths where the
cause is unknown. Deaths may be reported to the local coroner (who is either
medically or legally qualified, or both) by doctors, the police, the registrar,
various public authorities or members of the public. If the death is sudden and
the cause unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest if, after a
post-mortem examination has been made, he or she is satisfied that the death
was due to natural causes. Where there is reason to believe that the deceased
died a violent or unnatural death or died in prison or in other specified circum¬
stances the coroner must hold an inquest and it is the duty of the coroner’s
court to establish how, when and where the deceased died. A coroner may sit
alone, or in certain circumstances, with a jury. In Scotland the office of coroner
does not exist. The local procurator fiscal inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings to the Crown Office. In a minority
of cases a fatal accident inquiry may be held before the sheriff. For certain
categories (such as deaths in custody) a fatal accident inquiry is mandatory. In
addition, the Lord Advocate has discretion to instruct an inquiry in the public
interest in cases where the circumstances give rise to public concern.
The sentence passed on an offender is entirely a matter for the courts, subject to
the maximum penalty enacted by Parliament for each offence. The Government
ensures that the courts have available an adequate range of sentences to suit the
circumstances of each case and that they are well informed about the purpose
and nature of each available sentence. The Court of Appeal (see p 127) issues
guidance to the lower courts on sentencing issues when points of principle have
arisen on individual cases which are the subject of appeal.
In England and Wales a person may be sentenced to custodial treatment only if
the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. Unless that person has
previously received a custodial sentence of the same kind, he or she must also
120
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Non-custodial
Treatment
have been legally represented. A person given a custodial sentence in Northern
Ireland need not have been legally represented; a custodial sentence is, however,
used only as a last resort where the gravity of the offence and the offender’s
background rule out the imposition of any other sentence. In England and
Wales, extended sentences longer than the normal maximum term may be
imposed on persistent offenders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory
penalty of life imprisonment. This is the maximum penalty for a number of
serious offences such as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter. The death
penalty has been repealed for almost all offences (including murder and the
other common serious crimes) and it is no longer used.
In Scotland similar safeguards exist in relation to the imposition of custodial
sentences. Unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty is
determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indictment,
the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up to life,
and the sheriff court any term up to two years (to be increased to three years) but
may send any person to the High Court for sentence if the court considers its
powers are insufficient. In summary cases, the sheriff may normally impose up
to three months’ imprisonment or six months’ for some repeated offences,
although his powers are extended by statute in some exceptional cases. In the
district court the maximum term of imprisonment is 60 days.
The most common sentence in courts throughout the United Kingdom is a
fine, which is imposed in more than 80 per cent of cases. There is no limit to the
size of fine which may be imposed on indictment, but in summary procedure the
maximum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is £2,000. In Scotland it is
£2,000 in the sheriff court and £1,000 in the district court.
Under legislation passed in 1986 for England and Wales, the courts may order
the confiscation of the proceeds gained by a criminal from drug trafficking
offences. Similar provisions for Scotland are before Parliament.
The Government’s policy is to maintain and develop an effective range of
non-custodial sentences including fines, probation and absolute discharge. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the court may impose conditional
discharge when it considers there is no need to impose punishment; and
‘binding over’ where the offender pledges money, with or without sureties, to
keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
Offenders aged 16 or over (17 in Northern Ireland) convicted of imprisonable
offences may, with their consent, be given community service orders. The court
may order between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service (the maximum in England
and Wales is 120 hours where the offender is under 17) to be completed within
12 months. (This does not apply in Northern Ireland.) Examples of work done
include decorating the houses of old or disabled people and building adventure
playgrounds. The number of community service orders made in England and
Wales increased from 18,760 in 1981 to 23,170 in 1986, and in Scotland from
1,083 in 1981 to 2,733 in 1985. In Northern Ireland the number rose from 529
in 1981 to 730 in 1985.
Experimental schemes have been started to enable offenders to make direct
reparation to their victims, either by paying financial compensation or by
undertaking some service for them.
The sentence imposed on an offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
may also, with his or her consent, be deferred for up to six months to enable a
court to take into account conduct after some expected change in circum¬
stances. In Scotland sentence may also be deferred with or without the
offender’s consent. There is no limit to the lefigth of deferment.
The courts throughout Britain may order an offender to pay compensation for
personal injury, loss or damage resulting from an offence. The Government
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
121
Probation
favours the courts making full use of their compensation powers. Proposals have
been announced under which courts in England and Wales will be required to
give reasons for not awarding compensation to a victim who has suffered loss,
injury or damage.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a court is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served unless the
offender is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprisonment; in that
event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another sentence may
be imposed for the new offence. In England and Wales an offender receiving a
suspended sentence of more than six months may be placed under the
supervision of a probation officer for all or part of the period; courts also have the
power, when passing a sentence of between three months’ and two years'
imprisonment, to order that part should be served and the rest held in suspense.
In certain circumstances courts may order forfeiture of property involved in
the commission of crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime may be
disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, after a rehabilitation period of from six months to ten
years depending on the nature of the sentence imposed, a person convicted of a
criminal offence need not disclose it, and the offence will not be held against him
or her. This does not apply to those with a prison sentence of more than two and
a half years.
At present in the United Kingdom the number of offenders subject to
supervision in the community considerably exceeds the number in custody. The
purpose of probation is to protect society by the rehabilitation of the offender,
who continues to live a normal life in the community while subject to the
supervision of a probation officer. Before placing an offender on probation,
which may last from six months to three years, the court must explain the order
in ordinary language, ensuring that the offender consents to the requirements
of the order and understands that a failure to comply with them will make him
or her liable to a penalty or to be dealt with for the original offence. In England
and Wales such an order can be made only for offenders aged 17 years or more.
In Scotland the minimum age is 16 years and in Northern Ireland 10 years.
About 10 per cent of orders in England and Wales contain a variety of additional
requirements concerning place of residence, attendance at day centres or
treatment for mental illness. The probation service in England and Wales also
administers supervision orders, the community service scheme and parole. In
addition, social work services are provided in custodial establishments.
In England and Wales the cost of the probation service is shared between
central and local government and it is administered locally by probation
committees of magistrates and members co-opted from the local community. In
Scotland probation services are integrated with local authority social work
departments and in Northern Ireland the service is administered by a probation
board, whose membership is representative of the community and which is
funded by central government.
Probation committees provide and maintain day centres and hostels together
with schemes and programmes designed to meet the needs of a broad range of
offenders, and, if possible, drawing the community into partnership in
responding to offending. In Scotland and Northern Ireland these responsibilities
are undertaken respectively by local authority social work departments and the
probation board.
In England and Wales the services of probation officers are available to every
court, of both criminal and civil jurisdiction. In Scotland, officers of the local
authority social work department are similarly available. Probation officers in
Northern Ireland are not available to civil courts.

The Government aims to provide a humane, efficient and effective prison
service. The daily average inmate population in 1986 in England and Wales was
nearly 46,900 and is projected to rise to between 53,000 and 59,000 by 1994. In
Scotland the average population in custody has remained fairly steady for the
last decade at around 4,900. In 1986, however, it rose to nearly 6,000. In
Northern Ireland the daily average inmate population is falling and was 1,824 in
1986.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
‘local prisons’; all are closed. Other prisons, open or closed, receive prisoners on
transfer from local prisons. (Open prisons do not have physical barriers to
prevent escape.) In England, Scotland and Wales sentenced prisoners are
classified into groups for security purposes. There are separate prisons for
women.
There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland, where the majority of offenders
are serving sentences for terrorist offences.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Those under 21 awaiting trial are, where possible, separated from older
prisoners.
Many of the prisons in England and Wales were built in the nineteenth
century, and are now in need of major repairs. Others are housed in converted
premises which are expensive to maintain. In order to reduce overcrowding and
to improve the standards of existing prison establishments, a major programme
of building and refurbishment is now in progress. This includes the construc¬
tion of 20 new prisons, three of which are already complete and in use. In
Northern Ireland, there is no overcrowding in the six prison establishments, five
of which have been built since 1970; two new prisons—one for men and one for
women—opened in 1986.
Most prisoners in Great Britain are eligible for remission of one-third of their
sentence provided it does not reduce the sentence to less than five days.
Remission may be forfeited for serious misconduct. There is no remission for
prisoners serving sentences under civil law and those serving sentences of
unspecified length (for example, the criminally insane, whose release depends
upon improvement in their mental condition).
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a sentence of more than five days are
eligible for remission of half their sentence. A prisoner serving a sentence of
more than 12 months who is released from prison with remission is liable to be
ordered to serve the remainder of this sentence if convicted of fresh imprison-
able offences during this period.
In England and Wales prisoners serving determinate sentences of more than ten
and a half months become eligible for consideration for release on parole licence
when they have served one-third of the sentence, or six months, whichever
expires the later. (In Scotland they qualify after 12 months.) However, for those
serving sentences of over five years for violence or drug trafficking, parole is
granted only in exceptional circumstances, or otherwise for a few months at the
end of the sentence. The parole licence remains in force until the date on which
the prisoner would otherwise have been released from prison. It prescribes the
conditions, including the maintenance of contact with a supervising officer,
with which the offender must comply. In 1986 about 5-4 per cent of prisoners
granted parole in England and Wales, and about 2-7 per cent in Scotland, were
recalled to prison. Parole is not available in Northern Ireland, which has more
generous remission terms.
The release of prisoners serving life sentences is at the discretion of the Home

Secretary or in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, subject to a
favourable recommendation by the Parole Board and after consultation with the
judiciary. The Secretaries of State are not, however, bound to accept a
recommendation by the Parole Board for release, nor are they bound by the views
of the judiciary. At the discretion of the Home Secretary, people serving life
sentences for the murder of police and prison officers, terrorist murders,
murder by firearms in the course of robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least 20 years. At the end of 1986, there
were about 2,300 life sentence prisoners detained in prisons in England and
Wales of whom about 110 had been detained for over 15 years. Life sentence
prisoners are released on licence for the rest of their lives and are subject to
recall. In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State reviews life sentence cases on
the recommendation of an internal review body in such a way as to reflect their
gravity and to take account of Northern Ireland’s special circumstances.
Selected prisoners who are nationals of countries which have ratified the
Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons may apply
to be returned to their own country to serve the rest of their sentence there.
Prison industries aim to give inmates work experience which will assist them
when released and to secure a return which will reduce the cost of the prison
system. The main industries are clothing and textile manufacture, engineering,
woodwork, laundering, farming and horticulture. Most production caters for
internal needs and for other public services. A few prisoners are employed
outside prison. Small payments are made for work; in some prisons, incentive
schemes provide an opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and
skill.
Education is financed by the prison service and staffed by local education
authorities. In every establishment the education officer is assisted by a team of
teachers. Education is compulsoiy, full time, for young offenders below
school-leaving age. For older offenders it is voluntary. Some prisoners study for
public examinations (including those of the Open University). Within the
resources available there is a full adult education curriculum. Library facilities
are available in all establishments. Vocational training is provided directly by the
prison service. Physical education is voluntary for adult offenders but compul¬
sory for young offenders. Some 50 per cent of prisons now have purpose-built
physical education facilities while all but two of the remainder use gymnasia
converted from other buildings.
Education in Northern Ireland prisons is traditionally an evening activity, but
governors may and do permit prisoners who need help in basic education and
those preparing for public examinations to spend part of their working week on
educational pursuits. Recently, the distance-learning mode of study has been
introduced in a wide range of subjects, lessening the need for evening classes.
Prison education is provided by full-time and part-time staff. A wide range of
educational and vocational training facilities, from remedial education to Open
University level, is available.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation
for sick people and patients can also be transferred to National Health Service
hospitals. Psychiatric care is available.
The work of psychologists includes evaluating treatment programmes,
studying management practices, contributing to the management and treat¬
ment programmes of individuals and groups, taking part in advisory and

training work with staff and making assessments for treatment or allocation
purposes.
Prisoners are entitled to write and receive letters and to be visited by relatives
and friends, and those in open establishments may make telephone calls.
Privileges include a personal radio, books, periodicals and newspapers, and the
opportunity to make purchases from the canteen with money earned in prison.
Depending on facilities prisoners may be granted the further privileges of dining
and recreation in association, and watching television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the boards
of visitors (visiting committees in Scotland), who have power to order forfeiture
of remission. Boards of visitors (and visiting committees) consist of lay people,
two of whom must be magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the concern of all prison staff. Much of this work is
the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers) stationed in
prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals and agencies
outside and play a leading part in helping prisoners to make constructive
resettlement plans before their release. Prisoners may also receive visits from
specially appointed prison visitors whose work is voluntary.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life.
All prisons in England and Wales make pre-release preparations. Prisoners
serving four years or more are considered for outside employment before release.
For those selected, work is found outside the prison for about the last six
months of sentence; during the period prisoners may live in a separate part of
the prison or in a hostel outside. Normal wages are paid so that they can resume
support for their families. (In Scotland pre-release arrangements differ from
these in some respects.) Periods of home leave may be granted to those serving
medium- or longer-term sentences to help them maintain family ties and to
assist them with their resettlement. In Northern Ireland arrangements exist for
prisoners serving fixed sentences to have short periods of leave near the end of
their sentences and at Christmas; life sentence prisoners are given a nine-
month pre-release programme which includes employment outside the prison.
The aim of after-care, run by the probation service (in Scotland, the local
authority social services departments), is to assist offenders on return to society.
Compulsory supervision is given to most offenders under 21 when released,
adult offenders released on parole, and those released on licence from a life
sentence. A voluntary system is offered to others. Assistance is also provided by
voluntary societies, some of which are affiliated to the National Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. There is also a Scottish Association for
the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and accommodation may be
provided, often with government financial help. The Northern Ireland Associa¬
tion for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, also a voluntary group, is
mainly concerned with assisting petty criminals and alcoholics towards
rehabilitation and social awareness.
The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten years and it is not
possible to bring criminal proceedings against children below this age. Children
between the ages of 10 and 17 charged with committing a criminal offence may
be brought before a court, usually a juvenile court. A local authority may bring a
child of any age under the age of 17 to a juvenile court in a procedure known as
care proceedings if, for example, it suspects that he or she is in moral danger or
beyond the control of his or her parents. Under both care and criminal
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
125
Scotland
proceedings a court may make a care order or a supervision order or, if the
parents consent, an order requiring them to exercise proper care or control over
the child. Before an order may be made in care proceedings or a care order made
in criminal proceedings, it must be shown that the child is in need of care or
control which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the order is made.
Under a care order a local authority becomes responsible for deciding where
the child should be accommodated. It may allow him or her to remain at home
under supervision or place him or her with foster parents or in a voluntary or
community home. For children too severely disturbed or disruptive to be treated
in local authority homes, there are two special Youth Treatment Centres run by
the Department of Health and Social Security. The authority must review each
care order every six months and consider whether an application should be
made to the court to end it; the order normally expires when the child reaches 18
or 19. When a child who is already under a care order as a result of an offence
commits a further offence (for which an adult could be punished by imprison¬
ment) a court may attach a charge and control condition to the order. This
suspends for up to six months the local authority’s discretion to place the child
in his or her own home, but does not oblige the authority to place the child in a
community home. The local authority may, for example, place the child with
foster parents.
Under a supervision order (which may remain in force for not more than three
years) a child normally lives at home under the supervision of a social worker or
a probation officer, though the court may require him or her to live with a
specified person. The court has power to require that the child comply with
directions given by his or her supervisor or, in criminal proceedings, with
requirements made by the court itself. By either of these means, the supervision
order can be used to provide for a programme of ‘intermediate treatment’,
consisting of participation, under a supervisor, in a variety of constructive and
remedial activities through a short residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre.
In criminal proceedings, the courts may order payment of compensation, or
impose a fine or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. Payment of fines,
compensation or costs incurred by juvenile offenders is normally the responsi¬
bility of their parents or guardians. Offenders, both boys and girls, may be
ordered to spend a total of up to 24 hours of their Saturday leisure time (up to
three hours on any one occasion) at an attendance centre. The centres, which
provide physical education and instruction in practical subjects, are for those
found guilty of offences for which older people could be sent to prison. Offenders
aged 16 may be ordered to perform up to 120 hours of community service. Boys
aged 14 to 16, for whom a non-custodial penalty would not be appropriate, may
be sent to a junior detention centre for a term of three weeks to four months. The
regime is similar to that in senior detention centres (see p 126). Youth custody,
usually for periods in excess of four months, is available for boys and girls aged
15 or 16. The maximum sentence is 12 months. In the case of a very serious
crime, detention in a place approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered, and
must be ordered in the case of homicide.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children under the age of 16 years in court is rare and can take place only as
instructed by the Lord Advocate; court proceedings normally take place only
where the offence is of a serious nature, or where a child is prosecuted together
with an adult. Instead, children under 16 (or in certain circumstances those
aged between 16 and 18 if subject to a supervision requirement) who have
committed an offence or are considered to be in need of care and protection may
be brought before a children’s hearing. The hearing, which consists of three lay
126
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern
Ireland
Young Adult
Offenders
people drawn from a panel for each region or islands area, determines in an
informal setting whether compulsory measures of care are required and, if so,
the form they should take. An official ‘reporter’ decides whether a child should
come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are not accepted by the child or
parents, or if for any reason the child is not capable of understanding the
explanation of the grounds, the case goes to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the case to the reporter to arrange a
hearing. The sheriff also decides appeals against any decision of a children’s
hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children under the
age of 17 charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought before a
juvenile court. If the child is found guilty of an offence punishable by
imprisonment when committed by an adult, he or she may be sent to a training
school, placed in the care of a ‘fit person’, possibly the area health and social
services board, or put under supervision or on probation. Alternatively the court
can order a period at an attendance centre or a remand home, or impose a fine or
compensation. A conditional or absolute discharge or deferred sentence is also
possible. Whatever other order it makes, a juvenile court can also make an order
requiring parents to ensure the child’s good behaviour. Children brought before
the courts in need of care and protection may be placed in welfare homes or, in
special circumstances, in training schools.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years (16 to 21 years in Scotland) form a separate
category from juvenile and adult offenders. In England and Wales, the penalties
for young adults are fines and compensation, attendance centre orders and
probation orders; offenders may also be sentenced to up to 240 hours of
community service. As in the case of juvenile offenders, a custodial sentence may
be imposed only when no other measure would be appropriate. The custodial
sentences for offenders of this age are the detention centre order (for young men
sentenced to a term of four months or less) and the youth custody sentence (for
both sexes). For the most serious offences young adults may be sentenced to
custody for life. Detention centres, which receive offenders directly from the
courts, operate a consistent regime which is geared to the short sentences
involved. This inculcates a high standard of discipline and effort; in senior
centres it includes a full working week; younger offenders receive at least 15
hours of education a week. Both junior and senior centres provide one hour of
physical training each day. The youth custody centre regime is designed for
offenders who are usually serving a minimum sentence of over four months, and
for those allocated from a local prison. The aim is to provide flexible but coherent
programmes of activities which are as constructive as possible and can include
an element of vocational training. Some young offenders sentenced to youth
custody are held in local prisons and remand centres in special accommodation
where as full a regime as possible is provided. Legislation before Parliament
would permit young offenders sentenced to terms of youth custody of over four
but not more than six months to be placed in detention centres. Young offenders
are eligible for parole on the same terms as adults and all are supervised after
release.
In Scotland young offenders sentenced to detention serve their sentences
either in a detention centre (in the case of males only) or a young offenders’
institution, depending on the length of the sentence. Remission of part of the
sentence for good conduct, release on parole, and supervision after release are
available. In Northern Ireland, offenders aged between 17 and 21 who are
sentenced to three years or less are sent to a young offenders' centre.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
127
The Civil Law
CIVIL COURTS
England and
Wales
Civil Justice
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including concepts such as negligence,
defamation and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional
and administrative (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its own, often
analogous, branches.
An inquiry into the system of civil justice in England and Wales was set up in
early 1985. Its aim is to improve the machinery of civil justice through reforms
in jurisdiction, procedure and court administration, and in particular to reduce
delay, cost and complexity.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affilia¬
tion and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction regarding
nuisances under the public health legislation and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers actions founded upon
contract and tort (with minor exceptions); trust and mortgage cases; and
actions for the recovery of land. Cases involving claims exceeding set limits may
be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or in certain circumstances
on transfer from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the Rent
Acts, landlord and tenant, and adoption cases. Divorce cases are determined in
those courts designated as divorce county courts and outside London bankrupt¬
cies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also deal with complaints
of race and sex discrimination. Where small claims are concerned (especially
those involving consumers), there are special arbitration facilities and simpli¬
fied procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the Crown
Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have power to sit
in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges assigned to it
by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are mostly taken by
them. The judge normally sits alone, although on request the court may,
exceptionally, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chanceiy Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction is both original and
appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases. In general, particular
types of work are assigned to a particular division. The Family Division, for
instance, is concerned with all jurisdiction affecting the family, including that
relating to adoption and guardianship. The Chancery Division deals with the
interpretation of wills and the administration of estates. Maritime and
commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial courts of the
Queen’s Bench Division. A consultative paper examining the issues involved in
setting up a unified jurisdiction in family and domestic matters—a single ‘family
court’—was published in mid-1986.
Each of the 80 or so judges of the High Court is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division while in office. The
Lord Chancellor is president of the Chancery Division, administered by the
vice-president, the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s Bench Division is presided over
by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in
the legal hierarchy, and the Family Division is headed by the President. Outside

Civil
Proceedings
London (where the High Court sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings are
held at 25 Crown Court centres. For the hearing of cases at first instance, High
Court judges sit alone. Appeals in civil matters from lower courts are heard by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropriate
division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and guardianship proceedings heard by
magistrates’ courts go to a divisional court of the Family Division of the High
Court. Affiliation appeals are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from
decisions of the licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High
Court and county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and
may go on to the House of Lords, the final court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex-officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 23 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber), but
peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president of the
House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session. The civil
jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is normally
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff,
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or
directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and in general has jurisdiction to
deal with all kinds of action. The main exception is an action exclusive to the
sheriff court, where the value claimed is less than a set amount. It is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions of equal
status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being presided over by
the Lord President and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to
the Inner House may be made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court.
From the Inner House an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the
Court of Session are the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord
President of the Court of Session holds the office of Lord Justice General in the
High Court of Justiciary (see p 117).
The Scottish Land Court is a special court which deals exclusively with
matters concerning agriculture. Its chairman has the status and tenure of a
judge of the Court of Session and its other members are lay specialists in
agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in county courts, though
magistrates’ courts also deal with certain classes of civil case. The superior civil
law court is the High Court of Justice from which an appeal may be made to the
Court of Appeal. These two courts, together with the Crown Court, comprise the
Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland and their practice and
procedure are similar to those in England. The House of Lords is the final civil
appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry on the authenticity of the grievance is required. Actions
in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on the
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
129
defendant by the plaintiff, stating the nature of the claim. A defendant intending
to contest the claim informs the court. Documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County court
proceedings are initiated by a summons served on the defendant by the court;
subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but a procedure for
most undefended cases dispenses with the need to give evidence in court and
permits written evidence to be considered by the registrar.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can usually be abandoned or ended by
compromise at any time. Actions brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution cases,
when either party may, except in certain special circumstances, insist on trial by
jury, or a fraud case, when the defendant may claim this right. The jury decides
questions of fact and damages awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts
may be accepted.
An action in a magistrates’ court is begun by a complaint on which the court
may serve the defendant with a summons. This contains details of the complaint
and the date on which it will be heard. Parties and witnesses give their evidence
at the court hearing. Domestic proceedings are normally heard by not more than
three lay justices including, where practicable, a woman; members of the public
are not allowed to be present. The court may order provision for custody, access
and supervision of children, as well as maintenance payments for spouses and
children.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the debtor’s
wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining
someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey a judgment may result
in imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may
be effected only on a warrant.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (lawyers’ charges, court fees and
other payments) are within the discretion of the court. Normally, the court
orders them to be paid by the party losing the action, but in the case of family
law maintenance proceedings a magistrates’ court can order either party to pay
the whole or part of the other’s costs.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions in the
sheriff court are initiated by serving the defender with a summons (an initial
writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session actions the next step is the
publication of the action in the court lists. A defender who intends to contest the
action must inform the couit; if he or she does not appear, the court grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. In ordinary actions in the sheriff
court the defender is simply required to give notice of intention to defend within
a certain number of days after service of the initial writ, and this is followed by a
formal appearance in court by the parties to the dispute or their solicitors.
In summary causes (involving small sums) in the sheriff court the procedure is
less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in the summons. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the
parties involved having to appear in court. Normally they (or their representa¬
tives) need appear only when an action is defended.
Proceedings in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.
County court proceedings are commenced by a civil bill served on the defendant;
there are no pleadings in the county court. Judgments of civil courts are
enforceable through a centralised procedure administered by the Enforcement
of Judgments Office.

The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five judges
and up to ten other people with expertise in industry, commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of people or bodies exercising judicial func¬
tions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule, they are set up
under statutory powers which also govern their constitution, functions and
procedure. Their composition and procedures vary greatly. Compared with the
courts, they tend to be less expensive, less formal and more accessible; they also
have expert knowledge of their particular subjects. The expansion of the
tribunal system is comparatively recent, most tribunals having been set up since
1945. Independently of the executive, tribunals decide the rights and obliga¬
tions of private citizens towards one another or towards a government
department or other public authority. A number of important tribunals (notably
the rent and industrial tribunals) decide disputes between private citizens.
Some (such as those concerned with social security) resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further group (including tax tribunals)
decide disputed claims by public authorities against private citizens, and still
others decide issues in dispute which do not directly affect financial rights or
liabilities, such as entitlements to licences or the right to enter the United
Kingdom. Tribunals usually consist of an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached; some consist of one person sitting alone.
Members are normally appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but
other authorities have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The Lord
Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland) makes
most appointments where a lawyer chairman or member is required.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be made
in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of Session and
in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. In some cases an appeal maybe made
to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a government minister or to an
independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, which hears appeals on
questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals, has High Court and
Court of Session status in Great Britain. The Council on Tribunals (an
independent body, established in 1958) exercises general supervision over many
tribunals, advising on draft legislation and rules of procedure, monitoring their
activities and reporting on particular matters; those peculiar to Scotland are
dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council. The Council has a similar
responsibility with regard to public inquiries.
Administration of the Law
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and is
not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister, who recommends the highest
judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords); he is concerned with court procedure and is responsible
for the administration of all courts other than magistrates' and coroners’ courts,
and for a number of administrative tribunals. He appoints magistrates, and has
general responsibility for the legal aid and advice schemes. He is also responsible
for the administration of civil law reform.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
131
Scotland

The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons, and the probation and after-care service;
and has general supervision over magistrates’ courts, together with some
specific responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks).
Prison policy and the administration of custodial centres are functions of the
Home Office Prison Department, and the Home Secretary appoints to each
prison establishment a Board of Visitors representing the local community who
need to satisfy themselves as to the state of prison premises, administration and
treatment of inmates. They are required to report to the Home Secretary any
abuse or matter of concern which comes to their attention. Boards have
disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline and hear
applications or complaints from inmates. The Home Secretary is advised by a
special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under 17 is shared between the
Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security. The Home
Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the exercise of the royal
prerogative of mercy to pardon a person convicted of a crime or to cancel all or
part of a penalty imposed by a court.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General (the Law Officers of the Crown
for England and Wales) are the Government’s principal advisers on English law,
and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international cases. They
are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons and hold
ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for Northern
Ireland. As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General
has final responsibility for enforcing the criminal law; the Director of Public
Prosecutions is subject to the Attorney General’s superintendence. The Attorney
General is concerned with instituting and prosecuting certain types of criminal
proceedings, but must exercise an independent discretion, and must not be
influenced by government colleagues. The Solicitor General is, in effect, the
deputy of the Attorney General.
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,
staffing and organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local authorities. The Secretary of State
is also responsible for the criminal law of Scotland, crime prevention, and the
police and the penal system, and is advised on parole matters by the Parole
Board for Scotland. The Secretary of State is also responsible for legal aid in
Scotland and for the legal advice and assistance schemes.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal representa¬
tives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. Both are
government ministers. The Lord Advocate is closely concerned with questions of
legal policy and administration and is also responsible for the Scottish
parliamentary draftsmen. He has overall responsibility for the prosecution of
crime in Scotland and, although he holds a ministerial post, he must exercise an
independent discretion in carrying out this responsibility.
In Northern Ireland the judiciary is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Lord Chancellor. The administration of all courts is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State,
deals with the police and the penal system. The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for the legal aid and advice scheme in Northern Ireland.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts since the Crown is the
historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor, who is
head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet minister. With
the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from practising
barristers, advocates (in Scotland) or solicitors (see below). The judiciary is not a
career service as in many other countries. Lay magistrates in England and Wales
need no legal qualifications but on appointment undergo basic training to give
them sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence, and to
enable them to understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. The Scottish
district court justices of the peace likewise need no legal qualifications. In
Northern Ireland members of a lay panel who serve in juvenile courts undertake
training courses; resident magistrates are drawn from practising solicitors or
barristers. In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or
proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts may be removed from their
positions but, in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary from the
executive, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern Ireland (other
than the Lord Chancellor who changes with the Government) are subject to
removal only by the Queen on an address presented by both Houses of
Parliament; in Scotland there is no statutory provision for removing judges of
the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary from office and special
legislation would probably be needed to secure a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business for
individual and corporate clients, while barristers advise on legal problems
submitted through solicitors and present cases in the higher courts; certain
functions are common to both. Although people are free to conduct their
own cases, most people prefer to be legally represented in the more serious
cases.
The professional organisations for barristers are: the General Council of the
Bar (in England and Wales), the Faculty of Advocates (in Scotland) and the
General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland and the Executive Council of the
Inn of Court of Northern Ireland. For solicitors they are: the Law Society, the Law
Society of Scotland and the Law Society of Northern Ireland.
A person in need of legal advice or legal representation in court may qualify for
help with the costs out of public funds, either free or with a contribution
according to his or her means, under the legal aid and advice and assistance
schemes.
People whose income and savings are within certain limits are entitled to help
from a solicitor on any legal matter as it affects the applicant’s particular
circumstances. Such help includes advice on the relevant law, writing letters on
the client’s behalf, and taking the opinion of a barrister or advocate. In England
and Wales it may be extended to cover representation in civil proceedings in the
magistrates’ court. Mental Review Tribunal hearings and certain disciplinary
proceedings before prisons’ Boards of Visitors.
The scheme provides for initial work to be done up to a cost of £50 (£90 where
the client is the petitioner for a divorce or judicial separation in England and
Wales); thereafter the approval of the Law Society or the Scottish Legal Aid Board
is required before further costs can be incurred.

Changes in
the System
In a number of urban areas law centres provide free advice to people of limited
means. Most law centres (organisations financed from various sources, includ¬
ing the local authority) have at least two full-time salaried lawyers and many
employ community workers. Much of their time is devoted to tenant—landlord
disputes and other housing problems. Free legal advice is also available in
Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing advice centres and in specialist
advice centres run by various voluntary organisations.
Legal aid, which covers representation before the court, may be available for
most civil proceedings to those who satisfy the financial eligibility conditions.
An applicant for legal aid must also show not only that he or she has reasonable
grounds for taking or defending proceedings but also that it is reasonable in all
the circumstances of the case that he or she should receive, or continue to
receive, legal aid. If legal aid is granted the case is conducted in the normal way
except that no money passes between the client and the solicitor; all payments
are made through the legal aid fund.
In certain limited circumstances the successful unassisted opponent of a
legally aided party may recover his or her costs in the case from the legal aid
fund. Where the assisted person recovers or preserves money or property in the
proceedings the legal aid fund may have a first charge on that money or property
to recover the sums it has expended on the assisted person’s behalf.
The civil legal aid schemes are administered by the Law Society, the Law
Society of Northern Ireland and the Scottish Legal Aid Board while ministerial
responsibility for the schemes rests with the Lord Chancellor and, in the case of
Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant qualifies for financial help. An order must be made (subject to means)
when a person is committed for trial on a murder charge or where the prosecutor
appeals or applies for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) to the House of Lords. No person who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless given the opportunity to apply for
legal aid.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Lord Chancellor. Committees of
the Law Society provide a right of recourse against the refusal of legal aid in
some cases by a magistrates’ court.
Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act the Law Society makes arrange¬
ments for duty solicitors to be available at magistrates’ courts to provide initial
advice and representation to unrepresented defendants, and also for duty
solicitors to be available, on a 24-hour basis, to give advice and assistance to
suspects at police stations. The services of a duty solicitor are free.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland are
broadly similar. In Scotland there is a duty solicitor scheme for accused people
in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and the ‘interests of justice’ test
applies only in summary cases, where decisions on applications for legal aid are
taken by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. In Northern Ireland a duty solicitor
scheme has been introduced at the principal magistrates’ court in Belfast. Legal
aid for criminal eases in Scotland and Northern Ireland is free; the assisted
person is not required to make any contributions towards the cost of his or her
legal representation.
In a White Paper published in March 1987 the Government announced its
intention to make some changes in the way in which the legal aid system in
134
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
LAW REFORM
England and Wales is operated. Under the proposals a new Legal Aid Board
would be established which would initially take over responsibility for those
parts of the scheme currently administered by the Law Society. Following the
Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, a new non-departmental public body, the Scottish
Legal Aid Board, assumed responsibility for the administration of most legal aid
functions in Scotland on 1 April 1987. Legal aid in solemn criminal cases (see
p 117) will continue to be awarded by the courts.
While changes in the law are matters for Parliament, the duty of keeping the law
under review lies with the Law Reform Committee, the Criminal Law Revision
Committee and the Law Commission in England and Wales, and with the
Scottish Law Commission in Scotland. The Law Reform Committee and the
Criminal Law Revision Committee comprise judges and practising and
academic lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and the Home
Secretary, to examine aspects of the civil and criminal law in England and Wales.
The Law Commission, a permanent body reporting to the Lord Chancellor and
consisting of a High Court judge and four other members who are required to be
practising or academic lawyers, scrutinises the law with a view to its systematic
development and reform, and its simplification and modernisation. The
Scottish Law Commission is similar, and reports to the Lord Advocate. Law
reform in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Law Commission and the Office of
Law Reform.
6 Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. The National Health Service provides
a comprehensive range of medical services which are available to all residents,
irrespective of means. Local authority personal social services and voluntary
organisations provide help and advice to elderly people, disabled people and
children in need of care. The social security system is designed to secure a basic
standard of living for people in financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn, help for families and assistance with costs arising
from disablement.
Central government is directly responsible for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local authorities. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community services.
Planned spending on social welfare in 1987—88 is: health £21,314 million and
personal social services £4,312 million (together representing 14 per cent of
general government expenditure); and social security nearly £46,000 million
(26-5 per cent).
Expenditure on the health service has increased substantially in real terms
since 1980, and current spending is planned to grow further over the next two
years. More patients are now being treated than ever before. Spending on social
security is rising because of increased numbers of beneficiaries, especially
retirement pensioners and the unemployed, and the value of retirement and
most other long-term benefits has been increased in real terms since 1980.
Major reforms to the social security system have been introduced under the
Social Security Act 1986; these are designed to provide a clearer, simpler system
more capable of meeting genuine need (see p 155). Spending on the personal
social services is determined by local authorities, and while constraints are
placed by central government on the total expenditure of individual local
authorities, spending has risen subtantially in real terms since the late 1970s,
thus reflecting the priority given to this sector.
National Health Service
The National Health Service (NHS) is based upon the principle that there should
be a comprehensive range of publicly provided services designed to help the
individual to stay healthy and to provide effective and appropriate treatment and
care where necessary. All taxpayers, employers and employees contribute to its
cost so that those members of the community who do not require health care
help to pay for those who do. Some forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free of charge; others (see p 137) may be charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health service is being used to meet the needs
of increasing numbers of elderly people (over 45 per cent of health authority
136
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ADMINIS¬
TRATION
expenditure on hospital and community services is spent on care of the elderly);
to take full advantage of advances in medical technology and to remedy shortfalls
in such areas as renal services; to provide more appropriate types of care, often
in the community rather than in hospital, for priority groups such as the elderly,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people; to combat the growing health
problems arising from alcohol and drug misuse; and to remedy disparities in
provision between the regions of Britain.
The Government emphasises the importance of preventive health services,
and the responsibility of individuals for their own health. While great progress
has been made in eliminating infectious diseases such as poliomyelitis and
tuberculosis, there has been less success in controlling the major causes of early
death and disability—heart disease, cancer and stroke. Most recently the threat
of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, see p 145) has proved a
serious problem to public health. Because of the close link between such
diseases and individual life-styles or social habits, emphasis is placed on helping
people to adopt healthier ways of living through education and other policies. A
£2-5 million campaign was launched in 1987 to inform the public of the main
risks of heart disease.
The Government stresses the need for a partnership between the public and
private health sectors and for improving efficiency in order to secure the best
value for money and the maximum patient care. In order to secure more effective
management of resources in the National Health Service, general managers
drawn from inside and outside the Service have been appointed at all levels.
Further measures have included improving the accountability of health
authorities for the way in which they plan and manage their resources,
increasing the proportion of total staff who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses, and the introduction of a range of programmes to provide
existing services at lower cost. Considerable savings—some £86 million in
1986—have been made in many areas through a policy of competitive tendering
for hospital ancillary services such as cleaning, catering and laundry. Econo¬
mies are also made in prescribing by restricting the use of expensive branded
products in favour of cheaper but equally effective generic equivalents.
The health ministers (the Secretary of State for Social Services in England and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are respon¬
sible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries. The
health departments (the Department of Health and Social Security in England,
the Scottish Home and Health Department, the Welsh Office and the Depart¬
ment of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland) are responsible for
national strategic planning. District health authorities in England and Wales
and health boards in Scotland are responsible for planning and operational
control of all health services in their areas. England, because of its greater size
and population, has a tier of regional authorities responsible for regional
planning, resource allocation, major capital building work and certain special¬
ised hospital services best administered on a regional basis. The authorities and
boards co-operate closely with local authorities responsible for social work,
environmental health, education and other services. Family practitioner com¬
mittees (health boards in Scotland), accountable to the Secretary of State,
arrange for the provision of services by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and
opticians. Community health councils represent local opinion on the health
services provided. (In Scotland this function is exercised by local health
councils.)
In Northern Ireland health and social services boards are responsible for all
health and personal social services in their areas. The representation of public
opinion on these services is provided for by district committees.

PRIMARY
HEALTH
CARE
There are three Health Service Commissioner posts (for England, Scotland and
Wales) for dealing with complaints from members of the public about the health
service. All three posts are held by the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman). The jurisdiction of the Health Service Commis¬
sioner covers the failure of a health authority or family practitioner committee to
carry out its statutory duties, a failure in a service provided, or maladministra¬
tion causing injustice or hardship, but not actions taken solely in the exercise of
clinical judgment or the actions of family practitioners, for which separate
complaints procedures exist. The Commissioner reports annually to ministers
who lay the reports before Parliament, and may make other reports when
necessary. In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints has a similar
role.
About 86 per cent of the cost of the health service is paid for through general
taxation; the rest is met from the National Health Service contribution paid with
the National Insurance contribution and from the charges towards the cost of
certain items such as drugs prescribed by a family doctor, and dental treatment.
Health authorities may raise funds from voluntary sources. Certain hospitals
increase their revenue by taking private patients who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment.
The charges for medical prescriptions do not apply to children under 16 years,
expectant mothers and women who have had a baby in the last 12 months,
women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over, patients suffering from
certain medical conditions, war and armed forces disablement pensioners (for
treatment of their disability), and families with low incomes. Some 75 per cent of
prescription items are supplied free of charge. No charges for dental treatment
are made for dental examinations and denture repairs. Some groups of patients
receive entirely free dental treatment, for example, women who are pregnant or
who have had a baby in the last year, anyone under the age of 18, or 19 if in
full-time education, and people receiving supplementary benefit or family
income supplement (see p 160). Patients with low incomes may have their
charges remitted. Some groups also receive grants towards the cost of
spectacles.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and may be employed full time or part
time. Hospital doctors may accept private patients. Family practitioners
(doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) are self-employed contractors.
Family doctors (also known as general practitioners) are paid by a system of fees
and allowances designed to reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a
prescribed scale of fees. Pharmacists dispensing on their own premises are
reimbursed for the cost of the items supplied together with professional fees.
Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the
general ophthalmic service receive approved fees for each sight test made.
Primary health care is offered by doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists
working within the Service as independent practitioners, and by health visitors,
district nurses and midwives employed by the health authorities. A wide range
of other services is also available, including the school health service and the
chiropody service. The remedial professions of physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and speech therapy are making an increasingly important contribution
to primary care.
There have been substantial increases in primary health care staff in recent
years; for example, in England between 1979 and 1986 the number of family
doctors increased by 15 per cent (and by a similar percentage in Wales), with 30
per cent more support staff in general practice: dentists increased by 20 per cent

(24 per cent in Wales) and opticians by nearly 21 per cent (27 per cent in Wales).
Nursing and midwifery staff in primary care now stand at 43,000 with 133 per
cent more nurses specialising in mental illness. The trend in Scotland has been
similar.
Special funds have been earmarked by the Government for improving the
quality of primary health care in inner city areas.
The first comprehensive review of primary health care services has recently
been completed. Following a period of consultation, the Government intends to
propose reforms to raise standards of care and make services more responsive to
the needs of the public.
The family practitioner services are those given to patients by doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. Family doctors provide the first
diagnosis in the case of illness and either prescribe a suitable course of
treatment or refer a patient to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Only ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians
may test sight; patients requiring treatment for a defect in sight or an eye
disease are dealt with through the Hospital Eye Service. Spectacles are supplied
by registered ophthalmic and dispensing opticians but unregistered opticians
may also sell spectacles to adults under carefully prescribed conditions.
Children, those on low incomes and people requiring complex lenses are
provided with vouchers which may be exchanged for low-priced spectacles or put
towards the cost of higher-priced frames.
Health visitors are responsible for the preventive care and health education of all
families, particularly those with young children. They work closely with general
practitioners, district nurses and other professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere outside hospital: they also play an
important role in preventive care and health education. Although almost all
babies are born in hospital, some antenatal care and most postnatal care is
given in the community by midwives and general practitioners, who also care for
women having their babies at home. All midwives are responsible for educating
and supporting women and their families during the childbearing period.
About four-fifths of family doctors in Britain work in partnerships or group
practices, often as members of primary health-care teams which also include
health visitors and district nurses and sometimes midwives, social workers and
other professional staff. About a quarter in Great Britain and over a half in
Northern Ireland work in modern and well-equipped health centres, where
medical and nursing services are provided. Health centres may also have
facilities for health education, family planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental, pharma¬
ceutical and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient and supporting social
work services may also be provided.
A full range of hospital services is provided by district general hospitals,
including treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and
out-patients, maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and
geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of
specialised treatment. There are also specialist hospitals or units for children,
mentally ill, mentally handicapped and elderly people, and for the treatment of
specific diseases; examples include the world-famous Hospital for Sick Children,
Great Ormond Street, and the Brompton Heart and Chest Hospital in London.
Hospitals designated as teaching hospitals combine treatment facilities with
training medical and other students, and research work.
SOCIAL WELFARE
139
Private
Medical
Treatment
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were built in the nineteenth century; some
trace their origins to much earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous
St Bartholomew's and St Thomas' hospitals in London. Much has been done to
improve and extend existing buildings and many new hospitals have been or are
being opened. Since 1979 in England over 180 health building schemes, each
costing £1 million or more, have been started and completed. Nearly 500
schemes, worth over £3,200 million, are at various stages of planning, design
and construction. Of these, about 120 schemes costing a total of some £700
million are planned for completion over the next three years. In Scotland 48
major health building schemes, providing over 5,600 beds, have been completed
since 1979. A further 34 schemes are at various stages of development. Costing
some £290 million, these will provide a further 4,500 beds.
Recent policy in England and Wales has been to provide a well-balanced
hospital service centred around a district general hospital complemented as
necessary by smaller, locally based hospitals and facilities.
The latest development in hospital planning is the nucleus hospital designed
to accommodate a comprehensive range of district general hospital facilities and
capable of being built and commissioned in self-contained phases or as an
extension to an existing hospital. Many nucleus hospitals are being developed
and those already open have proved economical to build and are providing
high-quality and cost-effective services to patients. The world's first low-energy
nucleus hospital, which is expected to use less than half the energy of a
conventional nucleus hospital, is under construction on the Isle of Wight. A
similar hospital is planned for Northumberland.
National Health Service hospitals provide nearly half a million beds and have
over 480,000 medical, nursing and midwifery staff. The hospital service is now
treating more patients a year than ever before: in England between 1978 and
1985 the number of in-patient cases treated rose by 983,000 (18-3 per cent); the
number of day case attendances by 401,000 (71-3 per cent); and there were 3-5
million (10-3 per cent) more out-patient attendances. Newer forms of treatment
and diagnosis, such as kidney dialysis, hip replacements, laser treatment for
certain eye conditions, and body scanning, are being made more widely available.
In mid-1986 the Government launched a three-year drive to reduce hospital
waiting lists and times and has set up a fund of £50 million over two years to
finance a variety of projects, including mobile operating theatres and the
purchase of equipment, to improve waiting times for patients.
Community services such as the psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals,
and local authority day centres have expanded so that more patients remain in
the community and others are discharged sooner from hospital.
It is the Government’s policy to encourage the private sector to meet a larger
share of the nation's health needs in the belief that this will benefit the National
Health Service by relieving pressure on it. Some health authorities share
expensive facilities and equipment with private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the private sector to reduce waiting
lists. The scale of private practice in relation to the NHS is, however, small. Six
per cent of acute hospital beds are in private hospitals and nursing homes, and
over 3,000 beds in health service hospitals in Britain are occupied by private
patients. It is estimated that about half of those receiving acute treatment in
private hospitals or hospital pay-beds are covered by provident schemes which
make provision for private health care in return for annual subscriptions. In
1986 there were over 5-5 million subscribers to such schemes of whom the
majority were involved in group schemes, some arranged by firms on behalf of
employees. Subscriptions often cover more than one person (for example,
members of a family). Private practice is also undertaken by family doctors and

dentists. Many overseas patients come to Britain for treatment in private
hospitals and clinics, and Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is growing interest in alternative therapies such as homeopathy,
osteopathy and acupuncture, which are mainly practised outside the NHS.
Over the past 25 years there have been significant developments in transplant
surgery in Britain. Since 1972 the United Kingdom Transplant Service has pro¬
vided a centralised kidney matching and distribution service. At the end of 1986
about 6,500 people were living with functioning kidney transplants and during
the same year just under 1,500 kidney transplants were performed. In 1983 a
similar service was initiated for corneas, about 1,200 being transplanted each
year. Heart transplant operations have been conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire since 1979 and at Harefield Hospital, West London, since 1980.
A third heart transplant centre was opened at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle
upon Tyne in 1986 and a fourth centre is planned for 1989. By March 1987,
some 600 transplants had been performed; a study published in 1985 indicated
that one-year survival was about 70 per cent and the three-year survival rate
about 55 per cent. A programme of combined heart and lung transplants is also
in progress at Harefield, about 60 having been performed by the end of March
1987, while the world’s first combined heart, lungs and liver transplant
operation was carried out at Papworth in early 1987. Other organs and tissues
which are now successfully being transplanted include the pancreas and bone
marrow. A voluntary organ donor card system enables people to indicate their
willingness to become organ donors in the event of their death. Several million
people now participate in the scheme.
The blood transfusion service collects over 2 million donations of blood and over
44,000 donations of plasma each year from voluntary unpaid donors. Regional
transfusion centres recruit donors and organise donor sessions in towns and
villages, factories and offices, and within the armed forces. Donors must be
between the ages of 18 and 65. The centres are also responsible for blood
grouping and testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultancy service
to hospitals, teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and
technicians. Central laboratories manufacture blood products and undertake
research. While the use of whole blood for transfusions remains an important
part of the Service’s work, there is increasing emphasis on the most efficient and
effective use of blood and in particular its separation into components such as
plasma for specific uses. A new blood products laboratory at Elstree, Hertford¬
shire, was opened in 1987 with the aim of making England and Wales
self-sufficient by 1989.
Where necessary on medical grounds free transport by ambulance is provided by
the health authorities. The ambulance service performs emergency work,
dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity cases, and accidents of all kinds;
and non-urgent work, providing transport for people needing out-patient
treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals. In some areas the service for
non-urgent cases is augmented by voluntary organisations using their own
vehicles or by volunteers using their own cars. In Scotland an air ambulance
service is available in the islands and in the remoter parts of the mainland.
Rehabilitation begins at the onset of illness or injury and continues throughout
with the aim of helping people to adjust to changes in life-style and to live as
normally as possible. It is especially important for elderly, young, disabled,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people who need such help to resume life

in the community. Rehabilitation activities are carried out in hospitals, centres
in the community and in people's own homes through co-ordinated work by a
range of professional workers including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists,
occupational therapists, speech therapists, hearing therapists, clinical psycho¬
logists, dietitians and social workers. These staff may also work closely with the
disablement resettlement service of the Manpower Services Commission (the
Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland), housing, education
and social services departments of local authorities and with the voluntary
sector.
Medical services may provide, free of charge, artificial limbs and eyes, hearing
aids, surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances. Following assess¬
ment, very severely physically handicapped patients may be provided with
environmental control equipment which enables them to operate devices such
as alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating appliances.
Nursing aids may be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of facilities to assist patients in the
transition from hospital to their own homes, including the provision of aids and
adaptations, domiciliary care from home helps, and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers. Voluntary organisations also
provide valuable help in complementing the work of the statutory agencies and
in widening the range of available services.
A number of hospices provide care for the dying (including children) either
directly in residential homes or through nursing and other assistance in the
patient's own home. Control of symptoms and psychological support for patients
and their families form the central features of the modern hospice movement,
which originated in Britain and is now world-wide. Some hospices are
administered entirely by the NHS; the remainder, some of which receive support
from public funds, are run by independent charities. The Government is
encouraging a greater co-operation between the voluntary sector and health
authorities in this field.
Special preventive services are provided under the health service to safeguard
the health of expectant mothers and mothers with young children. Services
include free dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins; vaccination and
immunisation against certain diseases (see p 146); and health education, which
is available to parents before and after childbirth through talks, discussion
groups and demonstrations. Pregnant women are given antenatal care by their
family doctor and hospital clinics, and working women have the right to visit the
clinics during working hours. Some 98 per cent of women have their babies in
hospital, returning home shortly afterwards to be attended by the family doctor,
a midwife and a health visitor. The Government attaches great importance to
improving the quality of maternity services, and to making them more sensitive
to the needs and wishes of mothers and their families; it is advised by the
Maternity Services Advisory Committee. In Wales, for example, a special two-year
initiative to identify significant causes of perinatal mortality and to stimulate
improvements in maternity and neonatal care has resulted in over 50
recommendations for action which the NHS in Wales has been asked to
implement. The perinatal mortality rate (the number of stillbirths and deaths in
the first week of life) has fallen in recent years and in 1985 stood at 9-8 per
thousand births in England and Wales, compared with 15-5 per thousand in
1978.
A network of child health clinics run by district health authorities, and also
available in some general practices, provides facilities for surveillance by
doctors, dentists and health visitors of the physical and mental health and

development of pre-school children. Information on preventive services is given
and welfare foods are distributed. About 95 per cent of babies under one year are
taken to the clinics. The school health service offers health care and advice for
schoolchildren, including medical surveillance and dental inspection and
treatment where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services provide help and advice for
children with psychological or emotional problems.
In recent years special efforts have been made to improve co-operation
between the community-based child health services and local authority social
services for children, particularly to prevent child abuse and to benefit the
health and welfare of children in care.
The birth of the world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ in Britain in 1978, using the
technique of in vitro fertilisation, opened up new horizons for the alleviation of
infertility and for the science of embryology, but also gave rise to unease at the
apparently uncontrolled advances of science and the new possibilities of
manipulating the early stages of human development. In view of this public
concern, a committee of inquiry was established in 1982 under Baroness
Warnock to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of developments in
this field. Reporting in 1984, the committee concluded that certain specialised
forms of infertility treatment, including artificial insemination by donor and in
vitro fertilisation, were ethically acceptable, but that surrogate motherhood (the
practice whereby one woman bears a child for another) organised by agencies
should be prohibited; that research on human embryos was acceptable, but only
up to the fourteenth day after fertilisation; and that a licensing authority should
be established to regulate infertility services and research. Following the first
birth to be arranged by a commercial surrogacy agency in Britain in January
1985, legislation to ban commercial surrogacy agencies, and advertising of or for
surrogacy services, was passed later that year. The Government has made clear
its intention to introduce comprehensive legislation as soon as possible on the
issues dealt with by the Warnock Committee and in December 1986 published a
consultation document. Legislation on Human Infertility Services and Embryo
Research, on which it has invited views.
Free family planning facilities are available through family planning clinics,
hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide a similar service
for women only.
The Abortion Act 1967 allows the termination of pregnancy by a registered
doctor if two registered doctors consider that its continuance would involve a
greater risk to the life of the pregnant woman (or of injury to her physical or
mental health or that of any existing children in the family) than if the
pregnancy were ended. Termination may also be allowed if two doctors consider
that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from
such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
Abortions are carried out in NHS hospitals or in private premises approved for
the purpose by the Secretary of State. Over half of the 147,600 legal abortions to
women resident in England and Wales in 1986 were performed in private
hospitals and clinics; in Scotland, 98 per cent of abortions take place in NHS
hospitals. The Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
The growing misuse of dangerous drugs such as heroin and cocaine has
emerged as a serious social and health problem and the Government has made
the fight against such misuse a major priority. Its strategy comprises action to
SOCIAL WELFARE
143
Solvent Misuse
reduce the supply of illicit drugs from abroad and to tighten controls on drugs
produced and supplied in Britain; to provide even more effective law enforce¬
ment by the police and customs services; to increase the deterrent effects of the
law; to support effective programmes to treat and rehabilitate misusers; and to
discourage young people from experimenting with drugs. An interdepartmental
ministerial group on the misuse of drugs was established in 1984 to oversee,
develop and review the implementation of this strategy. As part of its prevention
policy, the Government opened a major publicity campaign in 1985 to dissuade
young people from drug-taking and to advise parents, teachers and other
professional staff on how to recognise and combat the problem. Over £17-5
million has been provided for local treatment and rehabilitation projects for up
to six years and an additional £6 million has been made available in 1987-88
through the health authorities in England for the further expansion of services
for drug misusers. Similar projects are in progress in Wales where £1-6 million
has been provided for voluntary groups and health authorities since 1985. A
number of trial schemes—subject to careful safeguards and monitoring—are in
progress involving the counselling of drug misusers and the exchange of clean
for used injecting equipment, since the sharing of equipment is one of the major
ways by which the AIDS virus (see p 145) is spread among drug misusers and
from them to the general population. The Government has set up a drugs
advisory service to advise district health authorities on the development of
facilities in their areas, and has made funds available for local education
authorities in England and Wales to appoint staff to promote and co-ordinate
preventive work in their areas. Separate programmes and campaigns are in
progress in Scotland.
The Government is advised on a wide range of matters relating to drug misuse
and connected social problems by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
Treatment for drug dependence is mainly provided on an out-patient basis.
Many hospitals provide specialist treatment for drug misusers, mainly in
psychiatric units, or have special drug treatment units. Some drug misusers
have a period of in-patient treatment when necessary. An increasing number of
family doctors also treat drug misusers but only certain specialist doctors are
licensed to prescribe heroin, cocaine and dipipanone (Diconal). All doctors have
a duty to notify the authorities of any patient they consider to be addicted to
certain controlled drugs, and guidelines on good medical practice in the
treatment of drug misuse have been issued to all doctors in Great Britain. The
Home Secretary has statutory powers for dealing with doctors found to have
prescribed irresponsibly.
A number of non-statutory agencies work with and complement the health
service provision; advice and rehabilitation services including residential
facilities, for example, are mainly provided by voluntary organisations. Support
in the community is provided by the probation service and local social services
departments.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse is funded by several government
departments.
Action is also being taken by the Government to curb the incidence of solvent
abuse (the inhaling of vapour from glue, lighter fuel and other solvents) by young
people. Voluntary guidelines were drawn up in 1983 in co-operation with
retailers to curb the sale of solvents, and legislation passed in Scotland added
solvent misuse to the list of grounds on which a child may be considered to need
compulsory care. In 1985 legislation was passed making it an offence in England
and Wales to supply such substances to children under 18 knowing or having
reason to believe they are to be used to cause intoxication. (Such sales have been
prosecuted successfully under common law in Scotland.) In 1987 a campaign
144
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Smoking

aimed at retailers was launched, with government support, to explain the
legislation and give advice on the sale of solvent-based products. Information
and guidance material have been distributed to parents, teachers and other
professional workers to help them to educate young people on the dangers of the
habit and to dissuade them from experimenting.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. It accounts for no fewer than 100,000 premature deaths each year and
costs the NHS an estimated £370 million a year for the treatment of diseases
attributable to smoking (for example, heart disease, lung cancer and bronchi¬
tis). Concerned at these harmful effects, the Government is following an active
health education policy based on advice and education, supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry aimed at reducing the level of smoking.
National publicity and media campaigns form the main thrust of official
efforts to discourage smoking. In 1986 the Government launched a £1 million
media campaign directed at young people in two test areas in England. The
results are now being evaluated. The Government also supports the work of the
voluntary organisation Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), and supports the
voluntary restriction on smoking in trains, buses, theatres and other public
places. Health authorities have been encouraged to promote non-smoking as the
normal practice on health service premises and to give help and advice to people
who want to give up smoking.
Voluntary agreements between the Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, tobacco product
modification and sports sponsorship by the industry. A new agreement on
tobacco advertising came into effect in 1986. This provides for the use of six
different health warnings about the dangers of smoking. It also contains
measures to protect particularly vulnerable groups, such as children, young
people and young women in early childbearing years, and provide a mechanism
for monitoring implementation of the agreement. Cigarette advertising is
banned on television and radio by law. The 1986 Protection of Children
(Tobacco) Act makes the sale of any type of tobacco product to children illegal. In
1987 a new voluntary agreement on sports sponsorship came into force. This
covers levels of overall expenditure, restrictions on sponsorship of events
principally for spectators under 18 years and controls over the siting of signs at
televised events.
The proportion of adults in Great Britain who smoke cigarettes continues to
fall. Among men this fell from 46 per cent in 1976 to 36 per cent in 1984; among
women it fell from 38 per cent in 1976 to 32 per cent in 1984.
There has been a growing public awareness in recent years of the importance of
a healthy diet. In 1984 a report on diet and cardiovascular disease produced by
the government Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy advised that a
reduction of fat in the diet could help to reduce the incidence or delay the onset
of cardiovascular disease. To help people to reduce their fat intake, the
Government plans to introduce statutory requirements for the labelling of food
to indicate fat content. Full nutritional labelling indicating the energy, protein
and carbohydrate content of food is being encouraged on a voluntary basis.
Some supermarket chains have already introduced voluntary labelling schemes.
In addition, the former Health Education Council (see p 145) and the British
Nutrition Foundation have produced practical dietary advice based on the
Committee’s report. The Committee is at present examining the role of dietary
sugars in human disease. The Scottish Health Education Group (see p 145) has
also produced a guide to healthier eating.

The far-reaching effects of alcohol misuse in terms of illness, family disruption,
inefficiency at work, loss of earnings, accidents and crime are widely acknow¬
ledged. The Government considers that the reduction of such abuse requires a
range of action by central and local government, voluntary and community
bodies, the health professions, business and trade unions. Of great importance
is the need for individuals to recognise and accept responsibility for their own
health, while attempts to influence the minority who misuse alcohol must, to be
realistic, respect the freedom of the majority who use alcohol responsibly.
The Government believes that emphasis should be placed on policies to
prevent alcohol misuse and continues to seek better information about the
causes of problem drinking, to encourage healthier life-styles and to provide
earlier identification and help for the problem drinker.
Treatment and rehabilitation include in-patient and out-patient services in
general and mental hospitals and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (general practitioners, nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing hostels, day centres and counselling services
also play an important role. There is close co-operation between statutory and
voluntary organisations, and the national voluntary agency. Alcohol Concern,
which received a government grant of £500,000 in 1986-87, plays a prominent
role in prevention of misuse, training for professional and voluntary workers
and improving the network of local voluntary agencies and their collaboration
with statutory bodies. The Scottish Council on Alcohol undertakes similar
activities in Scotland. Research and surveys on various aspects of alcohol
misuse are funded by several government departments.
Health education in England is promoted by the Health Education Authority
which, in April 1987, replaced the Health Education Council and became an
integral part of the National Health Service; it has the major executive
responsibility and appropriate budget for public education in Britain about the
disease AIDS (see below). In addition, in England the new Health Education
Authority will carry forward and develop the work of the former Council, its
functions being to advise the Government on health education, plan and carry
out national, regional or local programmes in co-operation with health
authorities and other bodies concerned with health education, sponsor research
and evaluation, assist the provision of training, publish and distribute material
and provide a national centre of information and advice on health education. In
Wales these functions are undertaken by the Welsh Health Promotion Authority,
which was established in April 1987. Health education in Scotland is promoted
by the Scottish Health Education Group. New arrangements for health
education support services in Northern Ireland are being considered.
Almost all health authorities now have their own health education service,
which works closely with health professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to determine the most suitable local
programmes. Increased resources in the health service are being directed
towards health education and preventive measures.
Government measures to limit the spread of the disease AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome) have included steps to improve the safety of blood and
blood products through the screening of blood donations and the heat treatment
of blood and blood products, and the launch in late 1986 of a £20 million public
education campaign involving national press, television, radio, cinema and
poster advertising, a national telephone advisory service and the delivery of
leaflets to all households in Britain. Additional funding for health authorities
has been made available for treatment and counselling services. Pilot schemes
have been introduced to check the spread of the disease in drug misusers (see
146

HEALTH

p 143). In early 1987 the launch of a new £14-5 million research programme was
announced; this will aim both to develop a vaccine to prevent infection and new
anti-viral drugs to treat people already infected. Approval has been given for the
use of the drug Retrovir (zidovudine—AZT), which was developed by a British
pharmaceutical company, in the treatment of AIDS sufferers. A number of
voluntary agencies, among them the Terrence Higgins Trust, are active in
promoting knowledge about the disease and counselling sufferers. The volun¬
tary sector receives financial support from the Government.
Britain also plays an active role in international efforts to combat the spread of
AIDS. Following a British initiative at the European Council in London in
December 1986, the European Community decided to exchange information
about the spread of the disease, its prevention and treatment, and to consider
what further co-operative measures should be taken by member states and the
scope for further co-operation in research. Britain fully supports the work of the
World Health Organisation (WHO) in leading and co-ordinating international
efforts to prevent and control the disease, and in 1987 gave £3 million to the
WHO’s Special Programme on AIDS to assist developing countries. Britain will
also be giving about £1-6 million over three years to the International Planned
Parenthood Federation to help it develop its capability to combat the disease.
Britain also co-operates with other countries on a bilateral basis.
District health authorities (health boards in Scotland) carry out programmes of
immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (women and girls only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough.
Immunisation is voluntary. Parents are encouraged to protect their children
since the benefits of immunisation far outweigh the small risk of adverse
reactions. The proportion of children being vaccinated has been increasing
since the end of 1978 following an earlier decline. A three-year campaign to
increase the take-up of rubella immunisation among girls aged 10 to 14 and
women who were not immune was launched in 1983.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct research
and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of communicable diseases.
Its largest establishment is the recently rebuilt Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. Two surveillance
centres, one in England and one in Scotland, investigate and monitor human
communicable diseases. Microbiological work in Scotland and Northern Ireland
is conducted mainly in hospital laboratories.
The cervical screening programme aims to reduce deaths from cancer of the
cervix by inviting women at risk to be screened regularly to identify the early
signs of the disease. All health authorities are to have computerised call and
recall systems for women from the age of 20 for cervical cancer screening by
March 1988. The Government is to set up a national breast cancer screening
service for all women aged between 50 and 64. Funds are being made available
for each region to have at least one centre in operation by 1988.
Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible for
the control of air pollution and noise, food hygiene and safety, occupational
health and safety aspects of a variety of premises including offices and shops,
the investigation of unfit housing, and in some instances for refuse collection
and home safety. Doctors who specialise in community medicine and are
employed by the health authorities advise local authorities on the medical

aspects of environmental health, infectious diseases and food poisoning. They
may also co-operate with the authorities responsible for water supply and
sewerage. Environmental health officers at ports and airports carry out duties
concerned with shipping, inspection of imported foods and disease control. In
Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collection
and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and hygiene.
It is illegal to sell food unfit for human consumption or to apply any treatment,
process or additive to food which makes it injurious to health. Premises where
food or drink is prepared, handled, stored or sold must conform to certain
hygiene standards. Environmental health officers may take for analysis or for
bacteriological or other examination samples of any food on sale or in the
distribution chain. Special regulations control the safety of particular foods
such as milk, meat, ice-cream and shellfish. The Department of Health and
Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish
Office, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland are the central departments responsible for giving advice and
making regulations.
Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicinal products. The Committees on
Safety of Medicines, on Dental and Surgical Materials and on the Review of
Medicines advise on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products. The
Committee on Safety of Medicines also monitors adverse drug reactions. The Act
also controls the advertising, labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply
of medicinal products.
In 1986-87 the health departments spent about £25 million on research and
development, in addition to expenditure by the Medical Research Council (the
main government agency for the support of biomedical research). Priority areas
include primary care, mental health and handicap, physical handicap and
rehabilitation, care of the elderly and children, and dental and nursing research.
For England and Wales the Chief Scientist of the Department of Health and
Social Security advises health ministers on the scientific validity of the
Department’s directly funded research programmes. He is supported by a
number of advisers from a wide range of disciplines. In Scotland the directly
funded programme is administered by the Chief Scientist of the Scottish Home
and Health Department. Health departments are involved in international
research and development, and all participate in the European Community’s
medical and public health research programme.
Only people whose names are on the medical or dentists’ registers may practise
as doctors or dentists in the National Health Service. University medical and
dental schools are responsible for teaching; the National Health Service provides
hospital clinical facilities for training. Full registration as a doctor requires five
or six years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years’ training at a dental
school is required. The regulating body for the medical profession is the General
Medical Council and for dentists, the General Dental Council. The main
professional associations are the British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
The minimum period of training required to qualify for registration as a first
level nurse in general, mental or mental handicapped nursing (and sick
148

children's nursing in Scotland) is normally three years. Registration as a nurse
at second level (enrolled nurse) takes two years (in Scotland 18 months).
Midwifery training for registered general nurses takes 18 months, and for other
student midwives in England three years. Health visitors are registered general
nurses with midwifery or approved obstetric experience who have successfully
completed a one-year course in health visiting. District nurses are registered
general nurses who have successfully completed a six-month course followed by
a period of supervised practice in district nursing. The examining bodies for all
nurses, midwives and health visitors are the National Boards for Nursing,
Midwifery and Health Visiting established in England. Scotland. Wales and
Northern Ireland. The regulation and registration of these professions is the
responsibility of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery
and Health Visiting.
Pharmacists in general practice and in hospital must be registered with the
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland. A three-year degree course approved by the Pharmaceutical
Society followed by a year's approved training is necessary before registration.
The majority of medicines can be sold or dispensed only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
The General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispens¬
ing opticians take a two-year full-time course with a year's practical experience
or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory scientific officers, occupational therapists, orthoptists. physiothera¬
pists and radiographers. The governing bodies are seven boards, corresponding
to the professions, under the general supervision of the Council for Professions
Supplementary to Medicine. Training lasts one to four years and only those who
are state registered may be employed in the National Health Service and some
other public services.
Dental therapists (who have undergone a two-year training course) and dental
hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may carry out
some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The member states of the European Community have special health arrange¬
ments under which Community nationals resident in a member state are
entitled to receive any immediately necessary treatment, either free or at a
reduced cost, during visits to other Community countries. There are also
arrangements to cover people who go to work or live in other Community
countries. In addition, there are reciprocal arrangements with some other
countries under which immediately necessary medical treatment is available to
visitors. Visitors are generally expected to pay if the purpose of their visit is to
seek medical treatment. Visitors to or from countries with whom reciprocal
arrangements have not been made are obliged to pay for any medical treatment
they receive.
Personal Social Services
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services
authorities (local authority social services departments in England and Wales,
social work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland). Their services are directed towards elderly people, children
SOCIAL WELFARE
149
The Elderly
Disabled
People
and young people, families, people with mental illness or with physical or mental
handicap, young offenders and other disadvantaged individuals and their
carers. The major services include residential care, day care, community care
and various forms of social work. Close co-operation is maintained between local
authority social services departments and health authorities (and other
agencies), and funding for joint schemes is being increased. In Scotland local
authorities also undertake duties similar to those of the separate probation and
prison after-care service in England and Wales.
Much of the care given to elderly and disabled people is provided in the
community itself, by their families, self-help groups and through voluntary
agencies. The statutory sector offers the skilled care needed in particular
services. The importance of the contribution made by the voluntary organisa¬
tions is recognised especially when economies are being made in public
expenditure and the demand on the statutory services is heavy.
The demand for personal social services is expected to rise over the next few
years, owing to the increasing number of elderly people and the changing
pattern of care for mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and the
chronically sick. The Government's policy, embodied in a ‘Care in the
Community' programme, is to speed up the transfer from hospital to care in the
community of patients who do not specifically need hospital care. It believes that
groups such as the elderly, the disabled, and mentally ill or handicapped people
can lead more normal lives in the community, given appropriate support and
facilities.
A review of the way in which public funds are used to support community care
policy is in progress.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to help
them to live at home whenever possible. (Only about 5 per cent of the elderly over
65 live in institutional accommodation.) These services may include advice and
help given by social workers, domestic help, the provision of meals in the home,
sitters-in, night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres,
luncheon clubs and recreational facilities. Appropriate adaptations to the home
can overcome problems of restricted mobility, and there is a wide range of
environmental aids to help people with impaired hearing or vision. Dispersed
alarm systems have been developed to help elderly housebound people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas good neighbour' and friendly visiting
services are arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation. Many
local authorities provide free or subsidised travel to elderly people within their
areas. Social services authorities also provide residential home care for the
elderly and infirm and register and inspect homes run by voluntary organisa¬
tions or privately.
As part of their responsibility for public housing, local authorities provide
accommodation specially designed for elderly people; some of these develop¬
ments have resident wardens. Housing associations and private builders also
build this type of accommodation.
Local social services authorities provide a wide range of personal social services
for disabled people to help with social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are also required to establish the number of disabled people in
their area and to publicise services, which may include counselling on personal
and social problems arising from disability; occupational, educational, social
and recreational facilities, either at day centres or elsewhere; adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, and ground-floor toilets); aids to daily
living; the delivery of cooked meals; and domestic or care attendant help. In
cases of special need, assistance may be given with the installation of a

telephone or a television set. For severely disabled people residential accom¬
modation or respite care may be provided by local authorities and voluntary
organisations, and specially designed housing may be available for those able to
look after themselves. Some authorities provide free or subsidised travel for
disabled people on public transport, and they are encouraged to provide special
access facilities to public buildings.
Social services authorities make arrangements for the provision of preventive
care for mentally ill people and after-care for both mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people in the community. Services include training centres for
mentally handicapped people and day centres for mentally ill people, as well as
social centres and a variety of residential care for mentally ill and mentally
handicapped people of all ages. Social workers help patients and their families to
deal with social and family problems arising from mental illness or mental
handicap and in certain circumstances can make an application for a mentally
disordered person’s compulsory admission to and detention in hospital. The
rights of compulsorily detained patients were extended by legislation in 1983,
and a Mental Health Act Commission was set up to provide better safeguards.
Corresponding legislation was introduced for Scotland in 1984, although the
Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland was first established in 1962.
Two recent priorities have been to transfer mentally handicapped children
from long-stay hospitals to community care, and, through a number of special
projects, to improve care for elderly mentally ill people.
An important role in provision of services is played by the many voluntary
organisations concerned with mental illness and mental handicap.
The Government believes in the central importance of the family to the
well-being of society and considers that stable adult relationships are necessary
to support and enhance family life. Social services authorities, through their
own social workers and other workers, give help of various kinds to families
facing special problems. This help includes services for children at risk of injury
or neglect who require care away from their own families, and support for family
carers who look after elderly and other family members in order to give them a
respite. They also help lone parents, including unmarried mothers. There are
now many refuges run by local authorities or voluntary organisations for
women, often with young children, whose home conditions have become
intolerable. The refuges provide short-term accommodation and support while
attempts are made to alleviate the women’s problems. Many authorities also
contribute to the cost of social work with families (such as marriage guidance)
carried out by voluntary organisations.
An initiative launched by the Government in 1983 with funds to run until
1988 seeks to increase voluntary sector provision in England for disadvantaged
families with children under five. A similar initiative was launched in Wales in
1985. In 1983 the Family Policy Studies Centre was established with official
funding to review the impact of public policies on the family and to bring
together research findings. The Self-help and Families Project provides funding
for nine voluntary agencies to develop the capacities of groups of families to help
themselves.
Day care facilities for children under five are provided by local authorities, by
voluntary agencies and privately. In allocating places in the day nurseries and
other facilities they themselves provide, local authorities give priority to children
with special social or health needs for day care. They also register, and provide
support and advice services for, childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups operating in their areas.
SOCIAL WELFARE
151
The authorities are empowered to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties to promote the welfare of children. The aim is to intervene
at an early stage to reduce the need to receive children into care or bring them
before a court.
The recognition, prevention and management of cases of child abuse are the
joint concern of many authorities, agencies and professions, and local review
committees provide a forum for discussion and co-ordination and draw up
policies and procedures for handling these cases.
Authorities must receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has
no parent or guardian, who has been abandoned, or whose parents are unable to
provide for him or her, if they are satisfied that such intervention is in the best
interests of the child. The child remains in care until the age of 18 unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends. The local authority
may find it necessary to assume the rights and duties of one or both parents.
The parents must be notified and if they object the matter is decided in a court of
law. When taking a decision concerning a child in care, the authorities have to
give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the
child. Where children are in care, every effort is made to work with their families
in order, where appropriate, to enable the children to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if they
are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, are beyond the control of
parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed an offence
other than homicide. At the same time it must be shown that the children need
care or control which they are unlikely to receive unless a care order or other
relevant order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for
undertaking inquiries through social workers and consultation with parents,
schools and the police. Children may be committed to the care of a local
authority under a care order if the court considers this appropriate. As an
alternative the court may order supervision by a social worker or a probation
officer for up to three years.
Legislation is proposed to reform the law on child care in England and Wales
so as to provide a clearer and fairer framework for the provision of services for
families and for protecting children at risk.
Increasing use is being made of intermediate treatment, especially for young
offenders. This is a community-based service which provides supervised
activities, groupwork and individual counselling; a short, residential period may
sometimes be included. A requirement to attend a programme of intermediate
treatment may be added to a supervision order by the court.
In Northern Ireland the court may send children to a training school, commit
them to the care of a fit person (which includes a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order. The law relating to children is being
reviewed and the intention is to make a distinction between young offenders and
children in need of care and protection. Strong emphasis is placed on preventive
work.
In Scotland children in trouble or in need may be brought before a children’s
hearing, which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it thinks that
compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Linder these requirements most
children are allowed to remain at home under the supervision of a social worker
but some may live with foster parents or in a residential establishment while
under supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of not
more than one year until terminated by a children's hearing or by the Secretary
of State.
When appropriate, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
considered appropriate or cannot be found, the child may be placed in a
152

children's home, voluntary home or other suitable residential accommodation.
Community homes for children in care in England and Wales comprise local
authority and some voluntary children's homes, and include community homes
with education on the premises which provide long-term care usually for the
more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for placing
children in their care in foster homes, in local authority or voluntary homes, or
in residential schools. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes for
children in the care of the health and social services boards; training schools
and remand homes are administered separately. Regulations concerning
registered voluntary homes and the boarding out of children in care are made by
central government.
It is generally accepted that adoption is an appropriate way to find a new family
for a very wide range of children of all age groups, including those with physical
and mental handicaps. About 20 per cent of the 8,000 or so children adopted
each year were previously in the care of a local authority. Agencies may offer
prospective adoptive parents an allowance if this would help to find a family for a
child. Adoption is strictly regulated by legislation, and adoption societies must
be approved by the respective social services minister. Local authorities must
establish and maintain an adoption service within their area, either by
providing the facilities themselves or by seeing that they are provided by
approved adoption societies. The Registrars-General keep confidential registers
of adopted children. Adopted people may be given details of their original birth
record on reaching the age of 18, and counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their adoption. In Northern Ireland the law on
adoption is being reviewed to bring it broadly into line with the rest of the United
Kingdom.
A person who has cared for a child for some time (for example, a foster parent,
step-parent or relative) may apply to a court for a custodianship order giving him
or her the legal custody of the child. On the making of such an order the
custodian will have most of the parental rights and duties of a natural parent
and will be able to make decisions about a child's day-to-day care and
upbringing, in the same way as a parent. Unlike an adoption order, a
custodianship order may be revoked. In Northern Ireland the law is being
reviewed to introduce custodianship provisions similar to those in the rest of the
United Kingdom.
The effective operation of the social services largely depends on the appointment
of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of social work.
Training courses in social work are provided by universities, polytechnics (in
Scotland, central institutions) and colleges of further education; their length
depends -upon educational qualifications and previous experience and can
extend from one to four years. However, the Central Council for Education
and Training in Social Work, which recognises social work courses and offers
advice to people considering entry to the profession, has proposed that
qualifying training courses be extended to a normal period of three years from
1991.
Professional social workers (including those working in the NHS) are mainly
employed by the social services departments of local authorities. Others
work in the probation service, the education welfare service, or in voluntary
organisations.
A review of the role of residential care and the changes required to enable
services to respond more effectively to changing social needs is in progress.
SOCIAL WELFARE
153
Voluntary Social Services
There is a long tradition in Britain of voluntary service to the community, and
the partnership between the voluntary and statutory sectors is encouraged by
the Government. It has been estimated that nearly a third of all adults take part
in some form of voluntary work during the course of a year. Local and health
authorities plan and carry out their duties taking account of the work of
voluntary organisations, and include them in the planning process. Voluntary
provision enables these authorities to continue the trend towards local
community care rather than institutional care for the elderly, and mentally ill
and mentally handicapped people.
An Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme, together with an Unemployed
Voluntary Action Fund in Scotland and a Community Volunteering Scheme in
Northern Ireland, has provided support for some 2,000 schemes by voluntary
agencies to enable unemployed volunteers to help disadvantaged groups in the
community. Voluntary organisations also participate in several other govern¬
ment schemes, including the Community Programme, the Voluntary Projects
Programme and the Youth Training Scheme.
Voluntary organisations derive their income from several sources including
voluntary contributions, central and local government grants, and earnings
from commercial activities and investments. Some 500 bodies receive direct
grants from government health and social services departments; in 1985—86
these amounted to some £32 million out of a total government funding of
£267-9 million to voluntary organisations. Tax changes in recent budgets have
helped the voluntary movement to secure a larger flow of funds from industry
and individuals.
Many voluntary organisations are charities, and in England and Wales the
Charity Commission gives advice to trustees of charities, initiating schemes to
modernise their purposes or facilitate their administration where necessary.
The Commission also maintains a register of charities, gives consent to land
transactions by charities and holds investments for them. Voluntary organisa¬
tions may qualify for charitable status if they are established for such purposes
as the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion or the
promotion of certain other purposes of public benefit including good community
relations, the prevention of racial discrimination, protection of health and the
promotion of equal opportunity. The Charities Aid Foundation, an independent
body, aids the flow of funds to charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Co-ordination of government interests in the voluntary sector throughout
Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations concerned with health and
social welfare, ranging from national bodies to small individual local groups.
‘Self-help' groups have been the most rapidly expanding part of the voluntary
sector over the last 20 or so years—examples include bodies which provide
playgroups for pre-school children, or help their members to cope with a
particular disability. Groups representing ethnic minorities and women’s
interests have also developed significantly in recent years. Many organisations
belong to larger associations or are represented on local or national co¬
ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly concerned with giving
personal service, others with the formation of public opinion and exchange of
information. Some carry out both functions. They may be staffed by both
professional and voluntary workers. While a majority of voluntary organisations
are concerned with social welfare in the ways described, there is a growing
interest among voluntary groups in cultural and environmental issues and in
participating in schemes to promote employment.
154
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The main co-ordinating body in England, which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies, is the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations; this acts as a resource, representative and develop¬
ment agency for the voluntary sector. It works to extend the involvement of
voluntary organisations in dealing with a broad range of social issues, to protect
the interests and independence of voluntary agencies, and to provide them with
a range of advice, information and other services. The Scottish Council for
Community and Voluntary Organisations, the Wales Council for Voluntary
Action and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action perform similar
functions.
Councils for Voluntary Service—National Association is another resource
network, with over 200 local councils for voluntary service throughout England
encouraging the development of local voluntary action in urban areas. The rural
equivalent is Action with Rural Communities in England, representing 38 rural
community councils.
The Volunteer Centre is a national voluntary organisation and centre for
information and research on voluntary work. There are many full-time and
part-time local volunteer bureaux which direct volunteers to opportunities for
voluntary service in both the voluntary and statutory sectors.
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned with personal and family
problems include the family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Associa¬
tion, Family Service Units and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisations;
the National Council for One Parent Families; Child Poverty Action Group and
the Claimants’ Union, both of which provide expert advice on social security
benefits; and the Samaritans, which helps the lonely, the depressed and the
suicidal.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people; this is often
channelled through national and local organisations such as Community
Service Volunteers, Scouts and Girl Guides, and the Time for God’ scheme run
by a group of churches.
Voluntary service to both sick and disabled people is given by—among
others—the British Red Cross Society, St John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which help
people with particular disabilities and difficulties include the Royal National
Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the Royal
Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, the Disabled Living Foundation,
the Disablement Income Group, MIND (National Association for Mental Health),
MENCAP (Royal Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and Adults), the
Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their
equivalents in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
National organisations whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on Social
Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children's Society, the
Church of England Council for Social Aid, the Young Men’s Christian
Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council, the Jewish Welfare Board and the Church’s Urban Fund.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flats and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family
problems, and assists in hospitals and clinics and during emergencies.
Over 900 Citizens Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to people who
are in doubt about their rights or who do not know about the state or voluntary
services available. Some areas have law centres and housing advisory centres.

Major New
Reforms
Social Security
The general aim of the social security programme is to provide an efficient and
responsive system of financial help for people who are elderly, sick, disabled,
unemployed, widowed or bringing up children. Certain benefits provide an
income for people who have little or no earnings because they are retired,
unemployed or sick. Others provide income for widows; assistance with extra
expenses arising from disablement; compensation for injury or disease caused
at work or while in the armed forces; and help with the cost of bringing up
children. Alongside these benefits there are certain means-tested benefits for
people who have insufficient means of support.
Social security benefits fall into two broad categories—contributory and
non-contributory. Contributory benefits are paid from the National Insurance
Fund, which consists of contributions from employed people and their
employers, self-employed people and the Government. Non-contributory benefits
are financed from general taxation revenue. Some are income-related—for
example, supplementary benefit and housing benefit—but others, for example,
child benefit, are not, and entitlement depends solely on meeting the qualifying
conditions. Appeals relating to claims for the various benefits are decided by
independent tribunals.
Expenditure on social security has nearly doubled in real terms since 1970.
Part of the increase has been due to the rising numbers of the elderly, and part to
the growth in unemployment; much, however, has been due to real improve¬
ment in the level of benefits, the creation of new benefits and increased family
support.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers the services in
Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are administered by the Department of
Health and Social Services. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Advice on social security is
given to the Government by the Social Security Advisory Committee.
Over the 40 years since the basic structure of the present social security system
was established there have been many piecemeal changes and developments,
and the system has become very complex. As spending on the system accounts
for nearly one-third of all public expenditure, and pressures for improvements
and increased expenditure are bound to continue, the Government considered
that a re-examination of the system was required, and following a series of
reviews and the publication in 1985 of a consultative paper and a White Paper,
Reform of Social Security: Programme for Action, government proposals for a
wide-ranging reform of the structure of the system became law under the Social
Security Act 1986. The main reforms, to be introduced by April 1988, include
the modification of the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme, which is
additional to the basic state pension, and new arrangements to encourage
personal and occupational pension schemes; and the introduction of a new
range of income-related benefits to replace family income supplement, sup¬
plementary benefit and housing benefit. Entitlement to all income-related
benefits will be assessed using the same basic rules. Family income supplement
will be replaced by family credit; this will consist of an adult credit plus a credit
for each child payable in full where income does not exceed a set figure, but
reduced where it does. Supplementary benefit will be replaced by income
support through which people will get a basic rate of benefit, with additions, or
premiums, for particular groups—families, lone parents, pensioners, and
long-term sick and disabled people. Help from the new social fund in the form of
loans or grants will be available to people on low incomes who have special or

emergency needs. These will include budgeting loans to help meet important
intermittent expenses, crisis loans for help in an emergency or as a result of a
disaster, and community care grants to help people to re-establish themselves or
remain in the community and to ease exceptional pressure on families.
Maternity and funeral expenses from the social fund were introduced in April
1987.
As part of its plans to improve the management of the social security system
and the quality of its service to the public, the Department of Health and Social
Security is embarking on the biggest computerisation programme in Europe,
which aims to link all of its local and central offices and the local offices of the
unemployment benefit service into a single network.
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits such as retirement pension,
sickness and invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance and
widow's benefit is dependent upon the payment of contributions. Industrial
injuries benefits are non-contributory, but are also payable from the National
Insurance Fund. There are four classes of contributions. Class 1 contributions,
which are related to earnings, are paid by employees and employers. The
contribution is lower if the employer operates a ‘contracted-ouf occupational
pension scheme (see p 157). Self-employed people pay a flat rate Class 2
contribution and a Class 4 contribution which is assessed as a percentage of
profits or gains within certain limits: they are not eligible for unemployment and
industrial injuries benefits. Voluntary Class 3 contributions are made by people
wanting to safeguard rights to some benefits.
Employees who continue working after pensionable age (60 for women and 65
for men) do not pay contributions but the employer continues to be liable. People
earning less than the lower earnings limit are not liable for contributions:
neither are their employers. Self-employed people with earnings below a set
annual amount may apply for exemption and those over pensionable age are
excused payment of contributions.
For most benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before benefit
can be paid at all, a certain number of contributions has to be paid: secondly,
the full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been made or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. Benefits are increased
annually, the uprating being linked to increases in retail prices. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates shown in Tables 5
and 6 are those effective from April 1987 until April 1988.
A state retirement pension is payable on retirement to women at the age of 60
and to men at the age of 65. The Sex Discrimination Act 1986 protects
employees of different sexes in a particular occupation from being required to
retire compulsorily at different ages. (This, however, has not affected the
payment of state retirement pensions at different ages for men and women.) The
state pension scheme consists of a basic pension together with an additional
earnings-related pension. Pensioners are permitted to earn up to £75 a week
before the amount of their pension is reduced: those still at work who have put
off or cancelled their retirement during the five years after minimum pension
age may earn extra pension. A non-contributory retirement pension is payable to
people over the age of 80 who meet certain residence conditions, and who have
not qualified for a contributory pension. People whose pensions do not give
them sufficient resources to live on may be entitled to supplementary pension,
which is calculated on the same basis as supplementary benefit (see p 160).
SOCIAL WELFARE
157
Mothers and
Children
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from work
looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely disabled
relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with the same
earnings. From April 1988 the earnings-related pension scheme will be based on
a lifetime's earnings instead of on the best 20 years and will be calculated as
20 per cent rather than 25 per cent of earnings. The pensions of people retiring
this century will be unaffected.
Employers are free to ‘contract-ouf their employees from the state scheme for
the additional earnings-related pension and to provide their own occupational
pension in its place, provided that the latter is at least as good as the state
additional pension. The State remains responsible for the basic pension. There
are at present around 90,000 occupational schemes, with some 11 million
members—about half the working population. As part of a programme to reform
the occupational pensions system, the Government has introduced measures to
protect against inflation the pension rights of people who change jobs before
pension age; to give workers the right on leaving a scheme to a fair transfer
value; and to require pension funds and other pension schemes to provide
access to more information about their schemes. The Social Security Act 1986
gives all employees the right to choose a personal pension rather than staying
fully in the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme or in an employer’s scheme.
Such pensions will qualify for contracting out of the State Earnings-related
Pension Scheme and will enable people to choose from a wide range of schemes
available from banks, building societies and trusts. The new regulations will be
introduced in January 1988.
Under the new statutory maternity pay scheme, which took effect in April 1987,
women who leave work to have a baby receive their maternity pay directly from
their employer and have more choice than previously about the time they have
off work. To qualify, a woman must have worked for the same employer for at
least six months up to and including the twenty-sixth week of pregnancy and
have had average weekly earnings in the last eight weeks of that period which
are not less than the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions.
Maternity pay is normally paid for 18 weeks. There are two rates: where a woman
has been working for the same employer for at least two years, she is entitled to
90 per cent of her average weekly earnings for the first six weeks and to the lower
rate of £32-85 for the remaining 12 weeks; where a woman has been employed
for between six months and two years, she is entitled to payments for the full 18
weeks at the lower rate.
Women unable to qualify, because, for example, they are self-employed, have
recently changed jobs or given up their job, may qualify for the new maternity
allowance which is payable at a flat rate for 18 weeks. To qualify for this, a
woman must have paid standard rate National Insurance contributions for at
least 26 weeks of the pregnancy.
A payment of £80 from the social fund is available for each living child born or
for a stillborn child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks or for an adopted
baby if the mother or her partner are receiving supplementary benefit or family
income supplement.
Non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for children.
Tax free and normally paid to the mother, it is payable for children up to the age
of 16 and for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in full-time non-advanced
education. A sum in addition to child benefit, called one-parent benefit, is
payable to certain people, whether parents or not, bringing up one or more
children on their own. A non-contributory guardian’s allowance for an orphaned
child is payable to a person who is entitled to child benefit for that child. In
certain circumstances it can be paid on the death of only one parent.

Benefit
At present, a widow’s allowance may be payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood, and an additional sum is often payable for each child. After this a
widowed mother with a young family receives a widowed mother’s allowance
with an addition for each child. Widow’s pension is payable to a widow who is 40
years or over when her husband dies or when her entitlement to widowed
mother’s allowance ends. Payment continues until the widow remarries or
begins drawing retirement pension. Widows also benefit under the industrial
injuries scheme. From April 1988 all widows will receive a tax-free lump sum
payment of £1,000 on bereavement in place of a widow’s allowance, together
with widowed mother’s allowance or widow's pension, and widow’s pension will
be payable at 45.
A man whose wife dies when both are over pension age inherits his wife’s
pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sickness
or disablement. Statutory sick pay with additions for a wife or other adult
dependants is payable by an employer for the first 28 weeks of an employee’s
illness. Employees not covered for statutory sick pay can claim sickness benefit
instead, as can self-employed people.
An invalidity pension with additions for a wife and children is payable when
statutory sick pay or sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary is still incapable of
work. An invalidity allowance may be paid with the pension to those people who
become sick more than five years before minimum retirement age. An additional
earnings-related pension may also be payable. A severe disablement allowance
may be payable to people of working age, including housewives, who are unable
to work and do not qualify for the National Insurance invalidity pension.
Various benefits are payable for disablement caused by an accident at work or
a prescribed disease. Disablement benefit is usually paid after a qualifying
period of 15 weeks if, as a result of an industrial accident or a prescribed
disease, there is a loss of physical or mental faculty. (During the qualifying
period sick pay or sickness benefit may be payable.) The degree of disablement is
assessed by an adjudicating medical authority and the amount paid depends on
the extent of the disablement. Disablement of 14 per cent or more attracts a
weekly pension; except for certain progressive respiratory diseases, disablement
of less than 14 per cent does not attract basic benefit. In certain circumstances
disablement benefits may be supplemented by constant attendance allowance
and an additional allowance payable in certain cases of exceptionally severe
disablement. A reduced earnings allowance is payable in certain circumstances
to people who, as a result of disablement assessed at 1 per cent or more, are
unable to follow their regular job or one with equivalent earnings.
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance allowance may be payable to severely
disabled people at either a higher or a lower rate depending upon the amount of
care and attention they require. It is payable from the age of two and there is no
upper age limit. A non-contributory invalid care allowance may be payable to
men and women aged between 16 and pension age who cannot go to work
because they are caring for a severely disabled person receiving an attendance
allowance.
Physically disabled people unable or virtually unable to walk may be entitled to
a tax-free mobility allowance to help to pay their transport costs. People aged
between 5 and 66 may claim and payment can continue up to the age of 75.
An independent organisation called Motability assists disabled drivers and
passengers wanting to use their mobility allowance to obtain a vehicle.
Unemployment benefit is payable for up to a year in any one spell of unem¬
ployment. Periods covered by unemployment or sickness benefit, maternity

BENEFIT
From April 1988 a new income support scheme will be payable to families who
are not in work and whose financial resources fall below certain levels. It will
consist of a basic allowance with additional premiums for families, lone parents,
pensioners and long-term sick and disabled people. Income support will replace
the present system of supplementary benefit under which the benefit payable
amounts to the difference between a person's existing resources and certain
specified weekly levels.
From April 1988 a new benefit—family credit—will be payable to low-income
working families with children. Family credit, which will be additional to child
benefit, will be related to net income, and to the number and age of children in
the family. It will replace the existing system of family income supplement which
is payable when the gross weekly income of a family falls below a prescribed
amount, varying according to the number and ages of children in the family.
From April 1988, the present housing benefit scheme, which offers help with the
cost of rents and rates (local property taxes) to people with low incomes, will be
restructured. The new scheme will use the same general assessment rules and
benefit levels as the income support scheme. This means that for the first time
help with rent and rates will be made through a single system instead of the
present two (one for those who get supplementary benefit and one for those who
do not).

TAXATION
The major new scheme will introduce a limit to the amount of capital a person
may have and still be entitled, and income will be taken into account net of
income tax and National Insurance contributions.
Pensions are payable to people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces
or by certain injuries received in the merchant navy or civil defence during
war-time, or to civilians injured by enemy action. The amount varies according
to the degree of disablement and rank; an allowance is paid for dependants.
There is a range of supplementary allowances, the main ones being for
unemployability, the need for constant attendance, the provision of extra
comforts, and as compensation for a lower standard of occupation. An age
allowance is payable to disabled pensioners aged 65 or over whose assessment is
40 per cent or more. Pensions are also paid to war widows and orphans.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works closely with the many
voluntary and ex-Service organisations which give financial aid and personal
help to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
Social security benefits, other than child, maternity, sickness, invalidity and
disablement benefit, are regarded as taxable income. Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of

dependants. The following benefits are not taxable: income support, family
credit, attendance allowance, mobility allowance, severe disablement allowance,
war disability pensions and allowances including supplementary allowances,
and war widow’s pension and allowances.
Other benefits for which unemployed people and those on low incomes may be
eligible include exemption from health service charges (see p 137), grants
towards the cost of spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid. Reduced
charges are often made to the unemployed, for example, for adult education and
exhibitions, and pensioners usually enjoy concessionary transport fares.
As part of the European Community’s efforts to promote the free movement of
labour, there are regulations providing for equality of treatment and the
protection of social security rights for employed and self-employed people
working in another member state. The regulations also cover retirement
pensioners and other beneficiaries who have been employed, or self-employed,
as well as dependants. Benefits affected include child benefit and those for
sickness and maternity, unemployment, retirement, invalidity, accidents at
work and occupational diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security agreements with a number of other
countries. Their scope and the benefits they cover vary, but the majority cover
most National Insurance benefits and family benefits.
7 Education
Policies
British education aims to develop fully the abilities of individuals, both young
and old, for their own benefit and that of society as a whole. Compulsory
schooling takes place between the ages of 5 and 16, although provision is made
for children under 5, and many pupils remain at school beyond the minimum
leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities, polytechnics and
colleges of further and higher education) is organised flexibly to provide a wide
range of opportunities for academic and vocational education and continuing
study throughout life. For many years the education service has been
characterised by change, and much of the post-1945 period has also been
marked by growth: large increases in the number of pupils, the expansion of
higher educational opportunities, and increased expenditure. Although the
process of change continues, recent years have seen increasing reassessment
and consolidation with a view to making the best use of resources in the light of
a substantial drop in the birth rate and the need to control public expenditure.
The overriding objectives of the Government’s education policies are to raise
standards and to achieve the best possible return from the resources invested in
the education service. In schools, standards of achievement are being raised by
improving school management, securing a broader and more balanced curricu¬
lum for all pupils so that they can develop the qualities and skills required for
adult life and work in a technological age, encouraging schools to be more
responsive to the needs of a multi-ethnic society, reforming the public
examination system and improving the quality of teaching through better
teacher selection, training and deployment. Parental preference as to school and
the need for increased parental involvement in school organisation receive close
consideration while gifted children from less well-off homes are given the
opportunity to attend certain independent schools.
Special attention is paid both to the provision of better pre-vocational
education and training in schools and colleges for the 14- to 18-year-old
age-group, and to the 40 per cent of lower-attaining pupils in the final years of
compulsory education. It is recognised that co-operation between the education
system and industry can help young people to acquire the skills necessary to
maintain Britain’s position as a leading industrial and trading nation. Many
organisations already work to improve such links, and further contacts are
being encouraged. An important objective has been to extend the knowledge and
use of microcomputers in schools.
Among a number of measures designed to raise educational standards in
schools in England and Wales, the Education (No 2) Act 1986 (which was
foreshadowed in a White Paper, Better Schools, published in 1985) aims to
reform the composition of school governing bodies and reallocate functions
between school governors, local education authorities and head teachers;
provide for the appraisal of the performance of teachers; and make in-service
training of teachers more effective. In response to the report of an inquiry into
the education of ethnic minority groups the Government has described its
policies for encouraging children from the ethnic minorities to achieve their full
potential. It has also announced its intention to introduce a national curriculum
in all schools in England and Wales.
164

Administration

A network of city technology colleges sponsored by industry and commerce is
to be set up in disadvantaged urban areas to provide broadly based secondary
education with a strong technological and business element. The colleges are to
be state-aided but independent of local education authorities.
A White Paper, Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge, incorporating
proposals for the higher education sector, was published in April 1987. A
continuing aim is to encourage institutions to improve their management and
planning, and become more flexible and responsive to the economic and social
needs of the country. It is planned to reform the University Grants Committee
and the system of university funding and to remove polytechnics and other
higher education colleges from local authority control. In line with the concern
to maintain British expertise in science, engineering and technology, a shift in
provision from the arts and social sciences towards these subjects and towards
directly vocational courses is occurring, while higher education institutions and
industry are being encouraged to collaborate more closely for their mutual
benefit. A number of science parks have been set up by higher education
institutions in conjunction with industrial scientists and technologists to
encourage the use of advanced technology.
The already strong vocational element in many courses in the non-advanced
sector of further education (which comprises courses whose level is at or below
General Certificate of Education Advanced level or its equivalent) is also being
increased. The role played by further education institutions in providing
training and continuing education is of great importance, especially at a time of
increasing technological change and high unemployment.
One of the distinctive features of the education service is the large degree to
which responsibility for provision is decentralised. Overall responsibility for all
aspects of education in England, and for the Government’s relations with and
support for universities throughout Britain, rests with the Secretary of State for
Education and Science. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have responsibility in their respective countries for non¬
university education, and are consulted about education in universities.
The main concerns of the education departments (the Department of
Education and Science in England, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education
Department, and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland) are
formulating national education policies, allocating resources and influencing
the other partners in the education service (the local education authorities,
governing bodies of educational institutions, the teaching profession, the
churches and voluntary organisations). The departments are also responsible
for the supply and training of all teachers.
The provision of maintained, that is, publicly financed, school education and
most post-school education outside universities is the responsibility of local
education authorities which are funded by central government and (except in
Northern Ireland) through rates (local property taxes). They employ teachers and
other staff, provide and maintain buildings, supply equipment and materials
and, in England and Wales, provide grants to students proceeding to further and
higher education. Universities are self-governing institutions receiving most of
their income from central government grants. In Scotland the central institu¬
tions, which provide most vocational higher education to degree level, and
colleges of education, which provide teacher training, are administered by
independent governing bodies. In Northern Ireland colleges of education are
controlled by the Department of Education or by voluntary agencies.
Planned spending on education and science in 1987—88 is some £20,000
million, more than 10 per cent of public expenditure. About four-fifths of this
EDUCATION
165
SCHOOLS
expenditure will be incurred by local authorities who make their own expendi¬
ture decisions according to local needs and circumstances. Factors affecting the
deployment of resources include changes in the number of school-age children,
the removal of surplus school places and savings made in such areas as the
provision of school meals and milk.
Local education authorities are also directly responsible for the funding of
most non-advanced further education courses. The Government’s expenditure
plans allow authorities and colleges to respond to the needs of employers and
students with a wide range of full-time and part-time courses.
An education support grant scheme in England and Wales enables the
Government to support local authority expenditure on educational activities of
national priority. In 1987—88 it is intended to provide £64 million out of total
expenditure of £92 million on 20 schemes including books and equipment for
school courses leading to the new General Certificate of Secondary Education;
information technology in non-advanced further education; and the supervision
of pupils at midday. The balance of the programme is aimed at improving the
efficiency of the education service through work on the curriculum, teacher
assessment, records of achievement and other aspects of the service.
Support for the universities and certain other higher education institutions,
and grants to students, account for most of the direct expenditure by central
government. About 79 per cent of universities’ income comes from public funds,
the major part being recurrent grant paid by the Government to the University
Grants Committee, which allocates the funds to individual universities and
certain other institutions. The Committee also advises the Government on the
future development of the universities. The independent University of Bucking¬
ham receives no assistance from public funds although its students can apply
for mandatory grants.
Funds for advanced courses in polytechnics and other colleges of further
education maintained by local authorities are allocated centrally. The National
Advisory Body for Public Sector Higher Education advises the Government at
present on how these resources should be allocated in England; the Wales
Advisory Body has a similar function. There is no equivalent organisation in
Scotland.
Many universities, polytechnics and other higher education institutions
undertake training, research or consultancy for commercial firms, and the
Government is encouraging them to secure a larger flow of funds from these
sources. Universities are now authorised to market inventions arising from
their research work. A number of establishments have endowments or receive
grants or gifts from foundations and benefactors. Local education authorities,
through their further education institutions, are empowered to sell goods and
services arising as by-products of educational activities.
Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Some 9-5 million children attend Britain’s 36,000 schools (of which 26,000
are primary or nursery and 5,000 secondary schools in the state sector). Most
pupils receive free education financed from public funds, but a small proportion
(roughly 7 per cent) attend schools wholly independent of direct public financial
support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools, and 87 per cent of
pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and Wales and 65 per cent in
Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools
are mixed. Most independent schools for younger children are co-educational;
the majority providing secondary education are single-sex, although the number
of mixed schools is growing.

No fees are charged to parents of children at maintained schools, and books
and equipment are free, although in Northern Ireland a small proportion of
grammar school pupils is admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided and
maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds. Voluntary
schools, mostly established by religious denominations, are also wholly
maintained from public funds but the governors of some types of voluntary
school contribute to capital costs. About a third of the 26,000 primary and
secondary schools supported by public funds in England and Wales are
voluntary schools, most of them Anglican or Roman Catholic. Each publicly
maintained school has a governing body, which includes governors appointed
by the local education authority and teacher and parent representatives. The
Education (No 2) Act 1986 provides for equal numbers of parent and local
authority governors, so that no single interest predominates. Governing bodies
now have responsibility for the main policies of their schools, and for the
preparation of a statement of their schools' curricular aims and objectives. They
also have ultimate responsibility for school discipline and a larger say in the
appointment and dismissal of staff.
In Scotland most of the schools supported from public funds are provided by
education authorities and are known as public schools (in England this term is
used for a type of independent school, see p 167). There is a statutory
requirement to establish school councils whose membership includes teachers,
parents, people interested in religious education, and in certain cases repre¬
sentatives of further education and of the community at large.
In Northern Ireland there are three main categories of grant-aided school:
controlled schools, owned and managed by the area education and library
boards and having all their expenditure met from public funds: voluntary
schools, mainly under Roman Catholic management and also maintained
largely by public funds: and voluntary grammar schools, which may be under
either Roman Catholic or non-denominational management and receive grants
from the Department of Education. Since the end of 1985 all grant-aided schools
have included elected parents and teachers on their boards of governors. It is
government policy to encourage integrated education, providing for both
Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils, where there is a local desire for it: a small
number of integrated schools have been opened with assistance from charitable
trusts.
In England, Wales and Scotland parents have a statutory right to express a
preference for a particular school for their children, and have an effective
channel of appeal at local level. Schools also have to publish basic information
about themselves and their public examination results.
Although there is no statutory requirement to provide education for the
under-fives, successive governments have expanded nursery education. Current
expenditure plans allow for the maintenance of existing levels of provision or a
small increase, mainly by converting surplus primary school accommodation to
nursery use. In England 43 per cent (and in Scotland 38 per cent and in
Northern Ireland 46 per cent) of three- and four-year-olds receive education in
nursery schools or classes or in infants’ classes in primary schools. In addition,
many children (at least 40 per cent of three- and four-year-olds) attend informal
pre-school playgroups organised by parents and voluntary bodies such as the
Pre-School Playgroups Association.
Compulsory education begins at five when children go to infant schools or
departments: at seven many go on to junior schools or departments. The usual

age for transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11 in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, but a number of local authorities in England have established
‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or 10 and ‘middle’ schools covering various
age-ranges between 8 and 14. In Scotland the primary schools take children
from 5 to 12.
The publicly maintained system of education aims to give all children an
education suited to their particular abilities. Over 90 per cent of the maintained
secondary school population in England and Wales attend comprehensive
schools, which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and provide a
wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of a district.
The schools can be organised in a number of ways, including those that take the
full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose pupils move
on to senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or 14, leaving at 16 or 18; and
schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form or a
tertiary college for pupils over 16. Tertiary colleges provide a full range of
vocational courses for students over 16, as well as academic courses. Most other
children receive secondary education in ‘grammar’ or ‘secondary modern'
schools to which they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is almost completely non-selective; the majority
of schools are six-year comprehensives. Because of local circumstances there are
some comprehensive schools at which courses may last only four years or less;
pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth years to a six-year
comprehensive.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is organised largely along selective
lines, based on a system of testing. There are, however, certain areas where
secondary schools operate on a non-selective basis.
Independent schools are outside the publicly maintained sector, but they must
register with the appropriate education department and are open to inspection.
They can be required to remedy serious shortcomings in their premises,
accommodation or instruction and to exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or to be the proprietor of a school.
There are about 2,300 independent schools educating 580,000 pupils of all
ages. They charge fees, varying from about £100 a term for day pupils at nursery
age to £2,000 a term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer bursaries to help
pupils from less well-off families. Such pupils may also be helped by local
education authorities—particularly if the authorities’ own schools cannot meet
the needs of individual children—or by the Government’s assisted places
scheme, under which assistance is given in relation to parental income (over
275 schools participate in the scheme). The Government also gives income-
related help with fees to pupils at certain specialist music and ballet schools.
There is great variety of provision within the independent sector, ranging
from small kindergarten to large day and boarding schools and from new and in
some cases experimental schools to ancient foundations. A number of indepen¬
dent schools have also been established by religious and ethnic minorities. The
550 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory schools are so called because they
prepare children for the Common Entrance Examination to senior schools. The
normal age range is from seven-plus to 11, 12 or 13, but many of the schools now
have pre-preparatory departments for younger children.
Independent schools for older pupils—from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include
about 500 which are sometimes referred to as ‘public schools’. Today the term is
becoming less frequently used but refers to the mainly boys’ schools (which are
increasingly admitting girls) belonging to the Headmasters’ Conference and/or
the Governing Bodies Association and to schools in membership of the

with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.
Special educational needs embrace learning difficulties arising from emotional
or behavioural disorders as well as physical or mental handicap. Local education
authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland must ensure that children
with special needs are educated in ordinary schools provided that the parents'
wishes have been taken into account and that this is compatible with meeting
the needs of the child, with the provision of efficient education for the other
children in the school, and with the best use of resources. In Scotland, school
placing is a matter for agreement between education authorities and individual
parents.
There are almost 2,000 special schools (both day and boarding), including
those run by voluntary organisations, which cater for a wide variety of handicap.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or school governing bodies. There are about 540,000 teachers in
maintained and independent schools, and the overall pupil—teacher ratio in
maintained primary and secondary schools is about 18-5 to 1. Teachers in
maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department (see p 176).
Under provisions contained in the Education (No 2) Act 1986, head teachers in
England and Wales are now responsible for determining and organising the
curriculum within their schools, taking into consideration the policy of their
local education authority and that of their governing body. The Government is
in favour of widening educational opportunities as much as possible through a
broad and balanced curriculum which is differentiated to meet the individual
needs of pupils and is relevant to the requirements of the modern world. To this
end the Government intends to proceed quickly towards the introduction of a
national curriculum which, during the compulsory period, will include the
foundation subjects of mathematics, English, science, foreign languages,
history, geography, technology, music, art and physical education. For each
foundation subject there will be clear attainment targets, allowing for variations
in ability for the key ages of 7, 11 and 14, together with nationally specified
programmes of study leading to those targets.
In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main or
secondary medium of teaching in some schools and in Scotland provision is
made for teaching in Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas. The content and
management of the curriculum in Scotland is the responsibility of education
authorities and individual head teachers though guidance is issued by the
Scottish Education Department, and the Department has advised that the
curriculum for 14- to 16-year-olds should include the compulsory study of
English, mathematics and science. As part of a development programme for 16-
to 18-year-olds, a flexible system of vocational courses based on modules or short
units of study has been introduced in schools and colleges in disciplines ranging
from business and administration to engineering and industrial production.
Though designed primarily to improve the preparation of young people for
working life, the courses are also intended to meet the needs of many adults
entering training or returning to education. The courses lead to the award of a
National Certificate.
In Northern Ireland major programmes of curriculum review and development
are in progress in both primary and secondary schools. The objective in the
secondary sector is to improve the quality and relevance of education for all
pupils in the 1 l-to-16 age-range, with more emphasis on economic and political

awareness, technological understanding, personal development and the en¬
couragement of study skills. At the same time teaching methods are being
reconsidered.
Over the last 20 years or so much has been done by the education authorities
to meet the special needs of ethnic minority children. English language teaching
has received priority, but attention has been increasingly directed at the use of
mother tongues, especially in the early years. Emphasis has been placed on the
need for schools to take account of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of
pupils. Measures are being taken not only to improve the achievement of ethnic
minority pupils but also to prepare all children, not just those of ethnic minority
origin, for living in a multi-ethnic society.
In England and Wales curriculum development is promoted by the School
Curriculum Development Committee. At some 500 teachers’ centres in England
and Wales, teachers meet for curriculum development work, discussion and
in-service training. In Scotland such development work is undertaken by the
Consultative Committee on the Curriculum and in Northern Ireland by the
Council for Educational Development.
Recognising the need to equip pupils of all abilities with the skills needed by
modern commerce and industry, the Government launched the Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative in England and Wales in 1983 and in Scotland
in 1984. Originally a series of pilot projects, it is being extended into a national
scheme in September 1987. The scheme is funded and administered by the
Manpower Services Commission, working in close co-operation with govern¬
ment education departments and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Schools. Projects
provide general, technical and vocational education for 14- to 18-year-old pupils
leading to nationally recognised qualifications; the extension of the scheme will
make it available to all young people in this age group in maintained schools and
colleges.
Great importance is attached to the acquisition and use of computers by
schools. As a result of the Government’s Micros in Schools and Micros in
Primaries schemes, virtually all schools in Britain possess at least one
microcomputer (maintained schools in England and Scotland have an average of
two microcomputers each,while secondary schools have an average of 14 each).
A six-year Microelectronics Education Programme (MEP) in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland which began in 1980 investigated and promoted the use of new
technology across the curriculum. With the ending of the MEP in 1986 the
Microelectronics Education Support Unit was set up to assist the work of local
education authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Priority is being
given to curriculum development, including the production of more and better
computer software; the development of teaching materials; in-service teacher
training; and the provision of information.
Under the ‘Software in Schools’ scheme funds are being made available to
promote the use of educational software in schools. Britain has developed a
world lead in several aspects of computer education and a large number of
countries have bought British educational software.
Scotland has its own microelectronics development programme mainly
through the Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
British School Technology, an independent education centre to promote the
teaching of technology in secondary schools and colleges, has been developed
with funding from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Manpower
Services Commission. The centre provides help to local education authorities
wanting to introduce courses into their schools, assists in training teachers,

co-operates with examination boards to assess new courses, and assists new

In England and Wales county and voluntary schools are required to give religious
instruction and pupils to take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless
their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in voluntary
schools, non-denominational religious instruction is given in accordance with a
locally agreed syllabus which may include the study of comparative religions.
Syllabuses have been revised in many areas to take account of the faiths of the
local population. In all kinds of voluntary schools there is the opportunity for
denominational instruction. In Scotland religious instruction must be given,
the content being determined by education authorities and schools in accord¬
ance with the wishes of the local community. Certain schools provide for Roman
Catholic children but in all schools there are safeguards for the individual
conscience. In controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of
access which may be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools
corporate worship and religious education are controlled by the management
authorities.
The principal examinations to be taken by secondary school pupils in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland around the age of 16 from the summer of 1988 are
those leading to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which
replaces the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary (O) level and the
Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE). The GCSE will normally be taken after
five years of secondary education and will have a seven-point scale of grades
denoted by the letters A to G. Grades A to C will have standards at least as high
as O-level grades A to C and CSE grade 1, which are usually the qualifying grades
for entry to further education or training.
The GCE Advanced (A) level is normally taken after a further two years of
study. New examinations, Advanced Supplementary (AS) levels, are being
introduced alongside them and will be examined for the first time in the summer
of 1989. The A-level examination is the standard for entrance to university and
other higher education and to many forms of professional training. These
institutions and many major employers and professional bodies have welcomed
AS levels and are adapting their requirements to recognise them.
GCSE courses were introduced in 1986 with a view to improving the
examination syllabus and raising standards of performance. Syllabuses and
assessment procedures comply with nationally agreed guidelines, known as
national criteria. The main objective of this and other policies is to bring 80 to
90 per cent of all pupils at least to the level achieved by pupils of average ability in
individual subjects (CSE grade 4), and to do this over a broad range of skills and
competence in a number of subjects. The AS level, the first courses for which
began in 1987, provides an opportunity for sixth-form pupils to study a wider
range of subjects than hitherto; students specialising in the arts and humani¬
ties, for example, will be able to continue the study of mathematics and
technological subjects at the new level.
The Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education, awarded for the first time in
1986, is intended for those at school or college who wish to continue in full-time
education for a year after the age of 16 to prepare either for work or for vocational
courses. It is being devised by the Business & Technician Education Council
and the City and Guilds of London Institute (see p 176).
The Secondary Examinations Council has been established to co-ordinate and
supervise systems of examination and assessment in England and Wales
designed principally for pupils in secondary education.
The public examination system in Scotland is different from that in other

parts of Britain. Scottish pupils take the Scottish Certificate of Education (SCE)
at Ordinary grade at the end of their fourth year of secondary education
(equivalent to the fifth year in England and Wales). Pupils in the fifth and sixth
years sit the SCE Higher grade, and passes at this grade are the basis for entry to
university, college of education or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies
(CSYS).
New Standard grade courses and examinations are being introduced to
replace the Ordinary grade. These will cater for the whole ability range and all
pupils will be assessed in examinations against nationally determined stan¬
dards of performance. The Higher and CSYS examinations are also being revised
to ensure compatibility with the new Standard grade.
Under the Government’s plan for the reform of non-advanced further
education in Scotland, the National Certificate was introduced in 1984-85 for
students over 16 who had successfully completed a programme of vocational
courses based on study units known as modules (see p 168).
The Government has decided that all pupils in England and Wales should, by the
end of the decade, be issued with a written record of their school achievements
and performance when they leave school; this would reflect achievements across
the whole educational programme of the school going beyond examination
results. There is a similar commitment in Northern Ireland.
Her Majesty’s Inspectors report to ministers on the quality of education provided
in all schools (and in most further education establishments outside the
universities) and advise local education authorities, schools and the Govern¬
ment; their reports on individual establishments are published (except in
Northern Ireland). Local education authorities also employ inspectors or
advisers to guide them on maintained schools.
The Assessment of Performance Unit of the Department of Education and
Science promotes the development of methods of assessment and monitors the
achievement of schoolchildren. Programmes of monitoring have been under¬
taken in English language and mathematics at the ages of 11 and 15, in science
at the ages of 11, 13 and 15, and in the first foreign language at the age of 13.
A survey of performance at the age of 15 in design and technology is to be
undertaken in 1988.
Teachers and pupils use a range of aids to assist the processes of teaching and
learning. The government-funded National Educational Resources Information
Service enables schools to find out about a wide range of teaching aids. Most
schools have audio-visual equipment such as slide projectors and overhead
projectors, and educational broadcasting is of major importance. Each year
more than 600 hours of school radio and 1,000 hours of television are
transmitted by the BBC and the independent broadcasting companies.
Teachers’ notes, pupils' pamphlets and computer software accompany many
broadcast series. Virtually all primary and secondary schools now have
microcomputers which are used for computer-assisted learning (see p 169).
The autonomous Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom
is the central organisation for promoting the application of audio-visual,
technological and other aids to education and training.
Increasing importance is being attached by schools (and by further education
establishments) to careers education to increase young people’s awareness of
further education and careers opportunities and generally help them to prepare
for post-school life. The work of careers officers at local level is supported by
172
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

EDUCATION
careers information material produced by the Government's Careers and
Occupational Information Centre. The Government is sponsoring the develop¬
ment of a computer-assisted careers guidance system for students in universi¬
ties, polytechnics and colleges.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the core curriculum of
all maintained schools, and playing fields must be available for pupils over the
age of eight. Most secondaiy schools have a gymnasium.
The government health departments are responsible for the medical inspec¬
tion of schoolchildren and for advice on, and treatment of, specific medical and
dental problems associated with children of school age. The Government
believes that the education service has a role to play in preventing and dealing
with juvenile drug misuse and in helping to prevent the spread of Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and it is encouraging teachers to help to
tackle these problems.
Local education authorities are free to decide what milk, meals or other re¬
freshment to provide at their schools, and what charges to make. (In Northern
Ireland, school meals must be provided.) Provision has to be made free of charge,
however, for pupils from families receiving certain social security benefits.
Under certain conditions the authorities must provide free school transport,
and they have discretionary powers to assist with the cost of travel to school.
More than a third of young people receive some form of post-school education,
compared with a fifth in 1965, while some 14 per cent of young people in the 18-
to 19-year-old age-group entered full-time higher education courses (that is, first
degree, postgraduate and other advanced courses of a standard higher than
GCE A level) in 1986. The number of degrees awarded per age-group is
comparable with that of other developed countries and the proportion of people
in all further and higher education also compares well, taking into account the
large proportion of part-time students and the large group of students receiving
professional training in firms rather than in educational institutions.
Post-school education is provided at universities, polytechnics, the Scottish
central institutions and other publicly maintained or assisted colleges: the latter
have a variety of titles including colleges of higher or further education, colleges
of technology, colleges of art, agricultural colleges and adult education centres.
There are also many independent specialist establishments, such as secretarial
and correspondence colleges and colleges for teaching English as a foreign
language. A number of voluntary and public bodies provide cultural and general
education, sometimes with assistance from local education authorities and
central government, and many education and training schemes are run by
public or private organisations, or firms.
The Government is seeking to improve awareness of the opportunities for
further education and training through the development of national informa¬
tion services, such as the Educational Counselling and Credit Transfer
Information Service funded by the Department of Education and Science.
Higher education, in the form of degree and other post-A-Ievel advanced
courses, is provided by universities, polytechnics, the Scottish central institu¬
tions and institutions of further and higher education, some concerned wholly
with teacher training. The Government considers that access to higher
education courses should be available to all those who can benefit from them
and who have the necessary intellectual competence, motivation and maturity.
In 1985—86 there were 78,000 more full-time home students in higher
education than in 1979—80. One of the Government's main objectives in higher
education is to bring about a change in the balance of provision in favour of
scientific, technological and directly vocational courses.
EDUCATION
173
Students
In order to maintain British expertise in information technology and related
fields, a three-year initiative was launched in 1982 to expand higher education
and research in electronics, engineering and computer science by providing
5,000 extra student places, and additional staff and research fellowships in
universities, polytechnics and Scottish central institutions. Under a separate
scheme, some 950 researchers and lecturers were appointed, mostly in the
natural sciences and technology. The Engineering and Technology Programme
announced in 1985 will, by 1989-90, provide a further 5,000 student places in
engineering, information technology and related scientific disciplines.
The term ‘further education' is generally used to define all post-school
education other than higher education, and comprises non-advanced courses
(of A-level standard or below). Non-advanced and some advanced courses are
provided by 740 colleges of further education, almost all of them controlled by
local education authorities. Non-advanced courses are also provided by adult
education centres. In Scotland the new modular courses at the non-advanced
level (see p 168) can be taken in schools, further education colleges or as part of
government training schemes.
Much of the provision outside the universities is broadly vocational in
purpose; it extends from lower-level technical and commercial courses to
advanced courses for those aiming at higher-level posts in commerce, industry
and administration, or taking up a variety of professions (for example,
town planning or estate management). The system is flexible and permits the
student to acquire whatever qualifications his or her capabilities and time
allow.
A large proportion of students on non-advanced courses attend part time,
either by day release or block release from employment or during the evenings. A
particular feature of the further education system is its strong ties with
commerce and industry: some two-thirds of spending in the non-advanced
sector, for example, is devoted to work-related studies. Co-operation with the
business world is encouraged by the Government and its agencies, and
employers are often involved in designing courses. In England and Wales a series
of College-Employer Links Projects, launched in 1984, help colleges to meet the
education and training needs of local firms by identifying the particular skills
and qualifications required by employers and developing ways of providing
them. In Scotland the 16+ Programme has similar aims. Further education
colleges provide much of the education element in industrial training pro¬
grammes like the Youth Training Scheme and the Training Opportunities
Scheme, both sponsored by the Manpower Services Commission. The former
scheme offers the opportunity of two years’ planned work experience and
training to 16-year-old school-leavers and one year’s to 17-year-old school-
leavers; the latter provides people aged 19 and over with the opportunity to
acquire new skills. The Further Education Unit is an advisory and development
body for further education.
Some 1,019,000 students were taking full-time courses in 1985-86, including
sandwich courses (where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with
periods of supervised experience on a relevant job), at universities and major
establishments of further education in Britain. Of these about 310,000 were at
universities while another 290,000 were following advanced courses outside
universities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics and
Scottish central institutions. More than 419,000 take non-advanced courses,
most of them studying for recognised vocational or educational qualifications.
There were also about 3-2 million part-time students, over 530,000 of whom
are released by their employers for further education during working hours.
Many of the remainder take part in adult education classes.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Universities
Over 90 per cent of full-time students on advanced courses are helped by
grants from public funds, which are mandatory for those students taking first
degree and other comparable courses who qualify under national rules. (Grants
for other courses may be given at the discretion of a local education authority.)
Grants cover tuition fees and maintenance, but parents contribute to main¬
tenance costs according to their income. They are awarded by local education
authorities in England and Wales up to first degree level; equivalent schemes are
administered in Scotland by the Scottish Education Department, and in
Northern Ireland mainly by the education and library boards. For postgraduate
study and research, grants are offered by the education departments and the
research councils. Some scholarships are available from endowments and from
particular industries or companies.
There are 47 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. They are governed by royal charters or in some cases by Act of
Parliament, and enjoy complete academic freedom, appointing their own staff
and deciding which students to admit, what and how to teach, and which
degrees to award. The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath,
Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London),
Durham, East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Newcastle upon Tyne, Notting¬
ham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton, Surrey, Sussex,
Warwick, York and the independent University of Buckingham. The Royal
College of Art, the Cranfield Institute of Technology, the London Graduate
School of Business Studies and the Manchester Business School also have
university status. The federated University of Wales comprises six constituent
institutions. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St Andrews, Stirling and Strathclyde
(Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there are the Queen’s University of Belfast and
the University of Ulster.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination or selection. Of the 310,000
full-time university students in 1985-86 (excluding those at the Open
University and the University of Buckingham), about 54,000 were postgraduate.
About half lived in colleges, halls of residence and other accommodation owned
by universities.
There are some 31,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly from
university funds. The ratio of staff to students is about one to ten, one of the
most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first degree courses are mainly full time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses usually
require five or six years. Degree titles vary according to the practice of each
university: in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the most common titles for a
first degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a
second degree Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of
Philosophy (PhD); in the older Scottish universities Master is used for a first
degree in arts subjects. Uniformity of standards between universities is
promoted by employing external examiners for all university examinations, and
the general pattern of teaching is fairly similar throughout Britain.
Research is an important feature of university work; many staff combine
research with their teaching duties and about half of postgraduate students are

engaged on research projects. The Government is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research projects. In June 1987 a new
information technology institute, sponsored jointly by industry and the
Cranfield Institute of Technology, was opened to link academic and commercial
interests.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using mainly a combination of correspondence
courses, television and radio broadcasts, and summer schools, together with a
network of study centres for contact with part-time tutors and counsellors and
with fellow students. No formal academic qualifications are required to register
for these courses, but the standards of the University’s degrees are the same as
those of other universities. Its first degree, for which courses began in 1971, is
the BA (Open), a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. The University also has a programme of higher degrees, BPhil, MPhil
and PhD, available through research, and MA and MSc through taught courses.
Whereas students must normally be resident in the United Kingdom, courses
are also available to English-speakers in Belgium and Luxembourg. The
University has advised many other countries on the setting-up of similar
institutions. A Continuing Education Programme, including short courses of
community education, in-service training for teachers, health and social welfare
workers and other professional staff, and up-dating courses for managers,
scientists and technologists, is the fastest-growing aspect of the University’s
work. In 1987 some 146,000 students were following Open University courses,
more than half at degree level.
A major contribution to post-school education in England and Wales is made by
the 30 polytechnics which have been established since 1967. They provide
courses in a wide range of subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a
concentration on advanced work. Courses may lead to first and higher degrees,
certain graduate-equivalent qualifications, the examinations of the main
professional bodies, and to qualifications such as those of the Business &
Technician Education Council (see p 176). One-year ‘access' courses provide a
foundation and an appropriate test before enrolment on a course of higher
education for prospective students who lack the standard entry qualifications.
Polytechnics have close links with commerce and industry, and many
polytechnic students have jobs and attend on a part-time basis. Similar
provision is made in Scotland in the 16 central institutions and a number of
further education colleges, and in Northern Ireland by the University of Ulster.
Institutes and colleges of higher education, formed by the integration of
teacher training with the rest of higher education, also account for a significant
proportion of higher education students, and other further education colleges
run some, usually specialised, higher education courses.
An increasing proportion of students on advanced courses in Great Britain
outside the universities are taking courses leading to the qualifications of the
Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council awards degrees
and other academic qualifications comparable in standard with those granted
by the universities. The courses range from science and technology to the
arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the proportion of technologi¬
cal, business or other broadly vocational courses is much higher than in
universities. In 1987 the CNAA instructed institutions running CNAA-approved
courses that they could apply to have delegated to them responsibility for
approving and reviewing their own courses.

A National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) was established in 1986
to reform the existing vocational qualifications system in England and Wales.
The Council will introduce a system of accreditation for qualifications awarded
for various levels of occupational competence by approved bodies. It will design
and implement a new framework - to be called the National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ) - which will incorporate qualifications which meet agreed
criteria within a simple structure of levels. The first accreditations within the
NVQ framework were made in the summer of 1987 and the first four levels
should be operating by 1991. In Scotland the new system of non-advanced
further education has already brought into operation a new vocational
qualification structure.
The Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC) plans and administers a
unified national system of courses at technician or equivalent level for students
in industry, commerce and public administration in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Courses leading to BTEC awards are available at polytechnics,
colleges of further and higher education, and in some schools. The Scottish
Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC) is the principal examining and
awarding body in the field of further education in Scotland. SCOTVEC is
responsible for the administration and development of the non-advanced
SCOTVEC National Certificate.
Qualifications in a wide range of craft skills are offered by the City and Guilds
of London Institute, and a variety of qualifications in commercial and office
practice are awarded by the Royal Society of Arts.
All entrants to school teaching must have taken a recognised course of teacher
training. In England and Wales courses are offered by institutes of higher
education, many universities and polytechnics and by certain other colleges.
Non-graduates usually qualify by way of three- or four-year courses leading to the
Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree; graduates take a one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority schools must be registered
with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. It is government policy that all
entrants to the teaching profession in Scotland should be graduates. New
primary teachers qualify either through a four-year BEd course or a one-year
postgraduate course of teacher training at a college of education. Teachers of
academic subjects at secondary schools must hold a degree containing two
passes in the subject which they wish to teach. In certain non-academic
subjects, a relevant specialist diploma has been acceptable in place of a degree,
but this provision is being phased out.
In Northern Ireland teacher training is provided by the two universities and
the two colleges of education. The principal courses are BEd (three- or four-year
honours), BA and BSc with education (three, four or five years) and the one-year
Certificate of Education for graduates.
The number of teachers to be trained to teach in primary schools is being
greatly increased in order to meet the anticipated rise in the number of primary
schoolchildren over the next few years. There will also be more admissions to
undergraduate courses of initial training for teachers of certain subjects in
secondary schools, including those subjects (like mathematics and physics)
where there have been long-standing shortages. Admissions to postgraduate
training courses for secondary teachers, the route by which about three-
quarters of all newly trained secondary teachers qualify, ar£ due to remain at the
present level until 1990.
The Government is taking steps to improve the quality of teaching by revising
selection, training and placement procedures for new teachers, and by providing
EDUCATION
177
Adult and
Continuing
Education
more in-service training opportunities. Management training courses for head
teachers are also being provided. The Government believes that more systematic
planning is required by schools and local education authorities to match
in-service training to both the career needs of teachers and to the curricular
needs of schools. A major new in-service training programme to improve the
quality of teaching in schools and institutions of further education, particularly
of the new technologies, was introduced under the Education (No 2) Act 1986.
The programme will cost £200 million in 1987-88, of which £70 million is being
allocated to projects of national priority, including training in the teaching of
mathematics, science, and craft, design and technology.
Measures taken to strengthen initial teacher training in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland have included the issuing of criteria which courses must meet
and the establishment of the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education
to review courses against the criteria. The Education (No 2) Act 1986 gives the
Government powers to require local education authorities in England and Wales
to appraise the performance of teachers. In Scotland, following recommenda¬
tions of working parties on teacher training, postgraduate courses are being
revised. All new pre-service and major in-service courses provided by colleges of
education must be approved both by the Scottish Education Department and by
a validating body.
It is becoming increasingly recognised that education is a process which
continues throughout adult life. The scope of adult and continuing education
has widened in recent years and now includes, in addition to the development of
the individual through cultural, physical and craft pursuits, such subjects as
basic education (for example, in literacy and numeracy); education for disadvan¬
taged groups and those with special needs such as ethnic minorities or the
disabled; consumer education; health education; and pre-retirement education.
Continuing education also includes training for those in employment to enable
them to keep pace with technological change. The Government has taken a
number of initiatives to improve opportunities for both adult and continuing
education. In 1982 it launched a Professional, Industrial and Commercial
Updating Programme (PICKUP), designed to help colleges, polytechnics and
universities to meet the need to up-date and broaden the skills of those in
mid-career in industry, commerce and the professions. A programme to
encourage the expansion of educational opportunities for the adult unemployed,
called REPLAN, was launched in 1984. The first courses of the Open College,
bringing together broadcasters, educationists and sponsors and providing
vocational education and training courses below degree level, are to be
transmitted in the autumn of 1987.
Apart from provision for mature students at universities, courses are provided
by the Open University, further education colleges, adult education centres,
residential colleges, extra-mural departments of universities and various other
bodies including a number of voluntary organisations. Most of the provision is
made by the local education authorities in a wide variety of establishments,
including schools used for adult evening classes and ‘community schools which
provide educational, social and cultural opportunities for the wider community.
Most courses are part time. Local authorities also maintain or aid many of the
short-term residential colleges or centres which provide courses lasting between
a weekend and a fortnight. Long-term residential colleges, grant-aided by central
government departments, provide courses of one or two years and aim to provide
a liberal education without academic entry tests. Most students admitted are
entitled to full maintenance grants.
University extra-mural departments and the Workers’ Educational Associa¬
tion, the largest recognised voluntary body, provide extended part-time courses

of liberal studies; they also run short courses for special (including vocational)
interests. Various kinds of education and training are provided by a wide range
of other organisations, for example, the National Federation of Women’s
Institutes, the Young Men’s Christian Association and the Pre-Retirement
Association.
The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education is a centre of
information, research, development work and publication for adult and
continuing education, as well as a channel of co-operation and consultation for
the many interested organisations in England and Wales. The Institute also
administers with government funding the Unit for the Development of Adult
Continuing Education which undertakes research and development work; the
Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, covering proficiency in literacy, numeracy
and communications skills; and a large part of the REPLAN programme. The
Institute’s counterpart in Scotland is the Scottish Institute of Adult and
Continuing Education.
In Scotland the Scottish Community Education Council advises the Govern¬
ment and promotes all community education matters including adult literacy
and basic education and the youth service.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Continuing Education advises the
Department of Education on adult and continuing education matters.
The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses of higher
education remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars and tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work or work experience. Educational aids are widely used.
Radio and television programmes, both specifically educational and general,
are important media for continuing education and are often linked to a range of
supplementary publications, courses and activities. The BBC, the independent
television companies and Channel 4 provide programmes which range from
basic education and progressive vocational training to domestic, social and craft
skills. The BBC also works with the Open University (see p 175), producing and
broadcasting radio and television programmes as part of the University’s
courses.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by central and local government,
the Economic and Social Research Council, philanthropic organisations,
universities and other higher education institutions, teachers’ associations and
certain independent bodies.
The major research institute outside the universities is the autonomous
National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales, with
income mainly from funds received from research projects and from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities; it also receives a small government grant. The Scottish Council for
Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for Educational
Research have similar functions.
Schoolchildren, students, teachers and others concerned with education come
to Britain from overseas to study, and British people work and train overseas.
Many opportunities for such movement are the result of international co¬
operation at government level within the European Community and within the
Commonwealth, and of educational schemes, courses and professional contacts
organised in Britain by officially funded and voluntary organisations. The

British aid programme encourages links between educational institutions in
Britain and developing countries.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer ties with
other member countries. Both in schools and in the colleges and universities
there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and languages,
and exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and students take place.
Britain has adhered to the Statute of the European Schools (nine of which
have been established throughout the Community including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire) to provide education for children of people employed in Community
institutions.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training.
British universities, polytechnics and other further education establishments
have built up their reputation overseas by offering tuition of the highest
standards, maintaining low student-to-staff ratios, and providing courses and
qualifications to meet present-day and possible future needs. First degree
courses tend to be shorter and more intensive than in many other countries
(three years is the normal length in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; three
or four years in Scotland).
In the academic year 1985—86 there were about 39,000 overseas students at
universities and 24,000 at polytechnics and other establishments of further and
higher education. In addition, many thousands of people from abroad were
training for such occupations as nursing, law, banking and accountancy, and
service and other industries. About half of all overseas students were from the
Commonwealth and Britain's dependencies. Many come to Britain for advanced
training: some 33 per cent of students enrolled for full-time postgraduate study
or research in Britain in 1985-86 came from overseas.
Most overseas students pay their own fees and expenses or hold awards from
their own governments. Those following courses of higher or further education
are charged fees which cover the full cost of their courses. Nationals of other
member countries of the European Community are generally charged the lower
level of fees that applies to British students.
The Government continues, however, to make considerable provision for
students and trainees from overseas under its overseas aid programme and
other schemes. At present about 17,000 overseas students are supported
annually (including some studying overseas) at a cost of about £80 million.
Three-quarters of this number are from developing countries, most of them from
the Commonwealth, and financed from the aid programme at a cost of some £65
million. Under a new Overseas Development Administration Shared Scholarship
Scheme, launched in 1986-87, 750 awards over five years are available mainly
at postgraduate level for students from the developing countries of the
Commonwealth, with costs being shared between the Government and the
educational institutions.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme,
funded by the Department of Education and Science, provides assistance for
overseas research students of high ability to attend British universities while
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Scholarships and Awards Scheme, which
operates in some 90 countries, is designed to benefit individuals likely to hold
positions of responsibility in their future careers.
Many public and private scholarships and fellowships are available to students
from overseas (and to British students who want to study overseas). Among the
best known are the British Council Scholarships, the Commonwealth Scholar¬
ship and Fellowship Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the Marshall
Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, and the Churchill Scholarships for men

and women in all walks of life. Most British universities and colleges offer
scholarships for which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
A number of British colleges of further education have entered into arrange¬
ments with British universities to provide ‘bridging’ courses for overseas
students before they enter university.
The continuing increase in interest in English as a foreign language is reflected
in the growth of the number of private language schools in Britain and the larger
proportion of these recognised by the British Council. At the same time the
British Council has expanded the volume of its own teaching of English overseas
by opening several new centres and extending existing ones, and runs a
programme for teaching English related to specific jobs and skills. Publications
and other material relating to English language teaching have also increased in
number and are now a large component in many publishers' lists, constituting a
major export.
The BBC’s English by Radio and English by Television services provide a
world-wide facility for the individual learner at home.
The promotion of cultural and educational relations with other countries is a
major concern of the British Council, which plays an important part in the
management of the aid programme to education. It recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short visits overseas by British experts, and encourages
cultural exchange visits. It also runs schemes to promote academic interchange
between universities and higher education institutions in Britain and other
countries, and exchange schemes in other scientific, educational and cultural
areas. Co-operation between universities in Britain and developing countries is
promoted by means of recruiting staff for overseas universities, the secondment
of staff from British universities, interdepartmental faculty link schemes, local
staff development, short-term teaching and advisory visits, and general consul¬
tancy services.
The Central Bureau, a charity financed by the Government, makes available
information and advice on all forms of educational visits and exchanges. It
develops and administers a wide range of exchange programmes such as teacher
exchanges with West European countries and the United States; short courses
in Europe for teachers; international visits for education specialists; and the
European Community Young Worker Exchange Scheme. It is responsible for the
linking of educational establishments and local education authorities with
counterparts abroad and the organisation of meetings and conferences. It
publishes a series of guides for people of all ages seeking advice on work, study
and travel abroad. In 1985 the Central Bureau and the British Council set up, at
the Government’s request, the Youth Exchange Council which develops,
implements and evaluates policy on youth exchanges between Britain and other
countries.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities promotes contact and co¬
operation between more than 300 member universities in 29 Commonwealth
countries. It assists student and staff mobility by administering various award
schemes including, for Britain, the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, and by providing an academic appointments service; it publishes
information about Commonwealth universities, courses and scholarships; and
organises meetings in different parts of the world.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The
United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body
serving overseas students, and organisations and individuals concerned in
student affairs.

The Youth Service
The youth service forms part of the education system and is concerned with
promoting the personal development and social education of young people by
providing opportunities for them to participate in a wide range of leisure-time
activities. Young people take part in the youth service on a voluntary basis.
Extending the range of experiences open to young people and giving them
opportunities to participate in the running of their organisations are seen as key
elements in the provision.
The youth service is a partnership between central government, local
authorities and voluntary youth organisations; at local level the youth service is
provided by voluntary organisations and local education authorities. Govern¬
ment education departments formulate broad policy objectives and encourage
their achievement through financial assistance and advice. The need to achieve
better planning, management and co-ordination of the youth service in
England, which was emphasised in an official review published in 1982, has
been endorsed by the Government. In 1985 the Government established the
National Advisory Council for the Youth Service for England and Wales to advise
ministers and others on the scale and direction of youth service activity and has
indicated those groups of young people to whom special attention should be
given. In Wales the Youth Work Partnership was set up in 1985 to promote the
co-ordination and development of services there.
National voluntary youth organisations promote the major share of youth
activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day expenses by
their own efforts. Many receive financial and other assistance from local
education authorities, which also provide facilities in many areas. The voluntary
organisations vary greatly in character and include the uniformed and church
organisations. Many local authorities and voluntary youth organisations have
responded to new needs in society by making provision, for example, for the
young unemployed, young people from the ethnic minorities, young people in
inner cities or rural areas and those in trouble or especially vulnerable. Other
areas of concern are homelessness, work with girls, and provision for
handicapped young people. Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisa¬
tions are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 535,000 and
743,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (about 506,000),
the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 165,000), the Young Men’s
Christian Association (905,000) and clubs run by the churches. The Young
Farmers' Clubs are distinguished as a movement in which decisions are taken
by the members themselves. There are also organisations like the Outward
Bound Trust providing opportunities for adventurous outdoor pursuits. The
three pre-service organisations (the Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air
Training Corps), with a membership of some 113,000, undertake activities
related to the work of the armed forces. Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are represented, and employ youth
officers to co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-service training. There are
also youth councils which are representative bodies of young people from local
youth organisations. At national level many voluntary organisations belong to
the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, a representative and
consultative body which aims to develop the partnership between voluntary
and statutory bodies in England. Similar councils exist in Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. The British Youth Council is a national forum for
young people, youth organisations and youth councils, including the youth
wings of the major political parties, and represents young people at an inter¬
national level. The youth service in England and Wales can draw on infor¬
mation, advice, training and research services provided by the National Youth

Bureau, which is funded primarily by central government and issues a range

In England and Wales a basic two-year training course at certain universities
and higher education colleges leads to the status of qualified youth and
community worker. A number of Bachelor of Education degree courses include a
youth and community option and there are courses for graduates who wish to
become youth workers. In Scotland one-, two- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are
provided by the University of Ulster. All school teachers who qualify before the
end of 1988 are recognised as qualified youth workers.
Full-time youth workers are supported by some 500,000 part-time workers,
many of them unpaid, both qualified and unqualified. Short courses and
conferences on youth and community work are held. There are also in-service
courses for serving youth workers and officers. Both initial and in-service
courses are validated by the Council for Education and Training in Youth and
Community Work.
A substantial sum of money is awarded by the many grant-giving foundations
and trusts each year for activities involving young people. The Royal Jubilee
Trusts, formed in 1978 from King George’s Jubilee Trust (started in 1935 at the
time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V) and The Queen’s Silver Jubilee
Trust, which arose from the 1977 Queen’s Silver Jubilee Appeal, support work
involving young people aged 8 to 25 (King George’s Jubilee Trust) and young
people up to the age of 25 involved in voluntary community service work (The
Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust). King George’s Jubilee Trust has distributed
nearly £6 million since 1935 and The Queen's Silver Jubilee Trust over £10
million since 1978. In addition, The Prince’s Trust, which was set up in 1976 to
help disadvantaged young people aged 14 to 25, has disbursed some £2 million
to individuals and small ad hoc groups.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies such
as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, enables
young people from Britain and other Commonwealth countries to take part,
with the voluntary assistance of adults, in a variety of challenging activities in
four areas: community service, expeditions, the development of personal
interests and social and practical skills, and physical recreation.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service designed
to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled, and many others
work on environmental projects. Organisations providing opportunities for
community service, such as Community Service Volunteers, International
Voluntary Service and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, receive
grants from the Government. Many schools also organise community service
activities as part of the curriculum, and voluntary work in the community is
sponsored by a number of churches.
8 The
Environment
Development
Plans
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has had
considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry, com¬
merce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing environ¬
mental pollution. The underlying approach is to promote efficiency, economy
and amenity in the use and development of land, respecting both the needs of
development and the interests of conservation. There is a statutory system of
land-use planning applying to virtually every kind of development, and there are
laws dealing specifically with environmental health, the control of pollution and
the conservation of the natural environment. Most development requires local
‘planning permission’, and applications for permission are dealt with in the
light of development plans which set out strategies for each area on such
matters as housing, transport, industry and open land. However, many minor
developments are subject to a general permission under which they do not need
a specific planning application; the opportunity is being taken to expand this
general permission wherever possible. Many voluntary organisations take an
active interest in planning, conservation and the control of pollution.
Planning
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and
Scotland and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England for land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Development
Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Strategic planning in
England and Wales excluding London is primarily the responsibility of the
county councils and the metropolitan district councils, while district councils
and, in London, the councils of the London boroughs and the City of London are
responsible for most local plans and development control, the main housing
functions and many environmental health matters. In Scotland planning
functions are undertaken by regional and district councils whose responsibili¬
ties are divided on a basis broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the
more rural regions and the islands, all planning responsibilities are carried out
by the regional and islands councils respectively. In Northern Ireland the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland is responsible for planning
matters through six divisional planning offices which work closely with the
district councils. The councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’ and
‘local’ plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities and
require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the development
and other use of land including measures for the improvement of the physical
environment and traffic management. Local plans provide detailed guidance,
either generally for development expected to start within about ten years, or,
more specifically, in ‘action area’ plans, where implementation is to be given
short-term priority, and in ‘subject’ plans which concentrate on special issues
184

such as mineral working. The plans are normally prepared by district planning
authorities, although sometimes by county planning authorities, and must
conform generally to the approved structure plan. In exceptional cases, with
ministerial approval, the adoption of a local plan may precede the approval of a
structure plan. Local plans are adopted by the planning authorities without
being subject to ministerial approval unless called in by the Secretary of State.
All plans are kept under review and may be altered from time to time. In Greater
London and the other six metropolitan areas in England structure and local
plans are gradually being replaced by new unitary development plans. This
follows abolition of the county planning authorities in those areas on 1 April
1986. Unitary development plans will be prepared and normally adopted by
London borough and metropolitan district planning authorities. They will
contain both general policies and detailed proposals for land use and develop¬
ment control. Like local plans, unitary development plans can be called in by the
Secretary of State in exceptional circumstances.
Scotland has a broadly similar system, with structure plans being prepared by
regional or islands authorities, and local plans by the districts. Regional and
islands authorities may also produce a regional report outlining their priorities
and policies. Under Northern Ireland’s single-tier system, plans are prepared by
the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity to
express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative stages of
the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must ensure
adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans; representa¬
tions may be made about them to the authorities. These opportunities for public
participation are additional to provisions for objecting to prepared plans. In the
case of structure plans the Secretary of State normally holds an examination in
public of matters on which he or she requires more information in order to reach
a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be heard at a public
local inquiry held by the planning authorities. There will be similar provisions
for participation in the preparation of unitary development plans and for
making objections to them. Usually the planning authorities will hold a public
local inquiry to hear objectors to unitary development plans.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority, and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. (In Scotland there is a system of
neighbour notification of planning applications, under which the applicant
must notify the proprietors of land and buildings adjoining the site of a
proposed development at the same time as the application is submitted to the
local planning authority.) The applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary of
State if planning permission is refused or is granted subject to conditions. Most
appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors (in Scotland reporters)
appointed by the Secretary of State.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of representations at public inquiries. For
planning applications which do not give rise to public inquiries there is a right
of appeal to an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretaries of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
them for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance, for example, proposals for a
major new airport or coalfield. The applicant'and the local planning authority

have the right to be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a
public inquiry is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development
schemes of exceptional importance the departments concerned have set up
procedures to aid the progress of the inquiry by helping the parties to resolve
procedural matters beforehand. Where highway development is proposed, the
government minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he or she considers
appropriate; these generally relate to the compulsory acquisition of land.
The 32 new towns designated since 1946 (see map, p 186) represent one of the
most significant achievements in recent British planning. Twenty-one of them
are in England, two in Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. Most
of them had an existing town or village as a nucleus. The new towns programme
has taken account of a number of policy objectives, notably the dispersal of
industry and population from congested cities to the surrounding regions, and
the stimulation of the regional economy in areas suffering from the decline of old
industries or in need of industrial diversification. The new town development
corporations’ priorities now are to maximise private investment in housing and
employment and to achieve a balanced community able to generate its own
growth. The new towns have a total population of over 2 million and by the time
their growth is complete are expected to house 2-5 million people. Several have
become regional centres for shopping and office accommodation.
In England the new towns programme is nearing completion, with 13 having
been substantially completed and their development corporations (which
supervised the planning and development of the towns) dissolved. Target
dissolution dates for the six remaining development corporations have now been
set in the late 1980s and early 1990s. When a development corporation is wound
up, its remaining assets are transferred to the Commission for the New Towns,
which manages the assets and arranges for their disposal, mainly to the private
sector. The New Towns and Urban Development Corporations Act 1985 provides
for the eventual dissolution of the Commission. The dissolution of the five
Scottish development corporations will not begin before 1990. In Wales
responsibility for Newtown rests with the Development Board for Rural Wales
(known as ‘Mid-Wales Development’) while the corporation responsible for
Cwmbran is to be dissolved in 1988. In Northern Ireland development of the new
towns has been incorporated in a new District Towns Strategy which is the
responsibility of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities is one of the most
important tasks in modern planning. Past policies have produced many
successes including the replacement of most of the slums and the improvement
of much old housing, but other problems remain. They include high unemploy¬
ment, decay and dereliction, and population structures with relatively large
proportions of the disadvantaged and the elderly. It is the Government's policy to
work out, in co-operation with local authorities, a package of measures for the
most badly affected areas that is most likely to improve conditions and
encourage, as far as possible, local voluntary action, notably by means of
‘partnerships’ (see p 187), and the co-operation of the private sector in
regenerating local economies. Various special measures, aimed at increasing
employment opportunities and the involvement of residents in the rejuvenation
of their areas, have been introduced.
The inner city areas have been given greater resources and priority by central
government for a number of years. The ‘Urban Programme’, which aims to
improve inner city employment prospects, to reduce the number of derelict sites
and vacant buildings, to strengthen the social fabric and to reduce the number

of people in acute housing stress, has been increased from a 1977-78 level in
England and Wales of under £30 million to £324 million in 1987-88. The
Programme complements the main economic, environmental and social pro¬
grammes of local authorities. It is being reorganised from 1987-88 as part of a
gradual attempt to improve its effectiveness. In January 1987 the Government
announced that, in order to achieve a greater impact with available funds,
resources were to be concentrated on 57 areas with special problems and needs.
The Urban Programme represents only a part of the central assistance to urban,
and other, local authorities. The main contributions are through the annual
rate support grant, housing subsidy and other programmes.
In certain places, special schemes are in operation. A co-ordinated ‘part¬
nership approach is in operation in seven English areas (Birmingham,
Liverpool, Manchester/Salford, Newcastle upon Tyne/Gateshead and the inner
London boroughs of Hackney, Islington and Lambeth) in which central and local
government work together to tackle urban problems where they are at their most
severe. Each partnership has a three-year action programme rolled forward
annually, which is based on the needs of the area and its particular priorities.
Partnerships receive allocations of urban programme resources ranging from
£10 million to £25 million a year. In 1985 the Government announced the
establishment of five ‘City Action Teams' (one for the inner London boroughs
and one for each of the other partnership areas) to secure improved co-operation
between government departments in developing and implementing their
policies and programmes for these areas. These teams were given special
budgets in April 1987 to enable them to develop collaboration between the
private and public sectors in key areas, and to promote project development.
In 1986 the Inner Cities Initiative was announced, involving the creation of
‘task forces’ to intensify and bring together the efforts of government depart¬
ments, local government, the private sector and the local community in eight
inner city areas: Leeds, Middlesbrough, Leicester, Manchester, Bristol, Birming¬
ham, and two in London. A further eight areas were added in April 1987:
Hartlepool, Rochdale, Preston, Nottingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton, Doncas¬
ter and the London borough of Tower Hamlets. Funds in addition to those
available under existing programmes are being provided and the initiative is
being co-ordinated by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
In 1981 the Government set up two urban development corporations modelled
on the new town development corporations, in the London docklands and the
Merseyside dock area. These are receiving some £111 million in 1987-88. Five
new urban development corporations were set up in 1987 at Trafford Park
(Greater Manchester), Teesside, Tyne and Wear, the Black Country (West
Midlands) and Cardiff Bay.
Urban Development Grant aims to promote the economic and physical
regeneration of deprived urban areas by encouraging private sector investment.
Grant is available for capital investment projects which would not otherwise go
ahead and would contribute to meeting the special social needs of inner urban
areas. Since the scheme was launched in 1982, some 290 projects have been
approved, representing investment of £772 million. Under the Housing and
Planning Act 1986 the Government is able to pay Urban Regeneration Grant to
private developers engaging in larger and more complex schemes to promote the
regeneration of difficult sites in run-down urban areas.
National garden festivals, based on the European idea of garden shows, are
being introduced with the aim of rejuvenating inner urban areas and reclaiming
derelict sites. The first festival in Liverpool in 1984, which had international
status and attracted nearly 3-4 million visitors, was followed by a second in
Stoke-on-Trent in 1986, and further festivals will be held in Glasgow in 1988,
Gateshead in 1990 and Ebbw Vale in 1992.

In Scotland, where the Urban Programme amounts to £38 million in 1987—88,
a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the city’s east end (the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal Project) has been organised on somewhat similar
lines to the partnership areas in England, and a further eight Scottish districts
have been designated under the Inner Urban Areas Act. In addition, the Scottish
Development Agency operates the Local Enterprise Grants for Urban Projects
Scheme (equivalent to the Urban Development Grant). In Northern Ireland,
inner city problems on a substantial scale are largely confined to Belfast, where
a major housing programme is supplemented by Urban Development Grants,
an environmental improvement scheme and a comprehensive development
programme to regenerate the commercial parts of the inner city. In 1987—88
these programmes have a combined allocation of £8 million.
In Wales, where the Urban Programme is administered by the Welsh Office, the
Secretary of State for Wales in 1986 launched a new three-year programme, the
‘Valleys Initiative’ for the south Wales valleys aimed at bringing about a
substantial improvement in the environments of the town centres and
surrounding areas. Ideas on how the valley communities can be revitalised and
improved are being sought from within the communities. The Welsh Office is
using existing mechanisms of assistance and making additional resources
available to bring about change.
Since 1981 the Government has set up 25 ‘enterprise zones’ (see map, opposite).
The aim of this experimental policy is to see how far industrial and commercial
activity can be stimulated by the removal of certain tax burdens and by relaxing
or speeding up the application of a number of administrative controls. The
zones, which contain land suitable for development, range in size from about 50
to 450 hectares (about 120 to over 1,100 acres). Benefits in the zones include
exemption from rates (the local property tax); 100 per cent allowances for
corporation and income tax purposes for capital expenditure on industrial and
commercial buildings; a much simplified planning system in which many forms
of development are automatically permitted; and a reduction in government
requests for statistical information.
The Housing and Planning Act 1986 provides for the establishment of
‘simplified planning zones’. They will use a simplified planning framework,
already operational in enterprise zones, under which advance planning permis¬
sion will be given for specified types of development within a zone. This will
remove the need for each developer to make a separate planning application in
these cases. They will not have the fiscal incentives available in enterprise zones,
but their effectiveness in promoting the development or redevelopment of an
area will be increased if they are used in conjunction with other incentives
which may be available.
Housing
The pattern of housing tenure has changed considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and a decline in privately rented
accommodation. Between the end of 1971 and 1986 the proportion of
owner-occupied dwellings in Great Britain rose from 51 to 63 per cent of the
housing stock, while the proportion accounted for by dwellings rented from a
local authority or new town authority fell from 31 to 27 per cent, and the
proportion of other types of tenure fell from 19 to 11 per cent. The fall in the last
category reflected the decline in privately rented dwellings, while the number of
housing association dwellings increased substantially during this period. There

are variations, however, in the distribution of tenure between different parts of
the country; in Scotland almost half of the dwellings are rented from public
authorities while in Wales about two-thirds of dwellings are owner-occupied.
The encouragement of a further extension of home ownership and the
regeneration of the independent rented sector are major aims of the Govern¬
ment’s housing policy, while the emphasis of public sector housing policy has
shifted from new building to modernisation, improvement and making better
use of existing dwellings.
There are some 22 million dwellings, houses being much more common than
flats (the ratio is roughly four to one), and around 50 per cent of families live in a
post-1945 home. Throughout this century pressure on housing accommodation
has been increased more by the rapid rise in the number of separate households
than by the increase in population. While the number of people has increased by
about two-fifths, the number of households has more than doubled. The 1981
Census showed the total number of households in Great Britain as 19-5 million.
Improvements in living standards were continuing: only 1 -3 per cent were not in
self-contained accommodation, 4-3 per cent lived at an average density of more
than one person per room and 3 -2 per cent were lacking or sharing use of a bath.
New house construction is undertaken by both public and private sectors but
over the past few years the private sector has built many more dwellings than the
public sector. In addition, 6 per cent of the new building in 1986 was carried out
by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authorities provide
dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly for sale to
owner-occupiers.
As with environmental planning, responsibility for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme is borne by the Secretary of State for
the Environment in England and by the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Although the policies are broadly similar throughout
Britain, provisions may differ slightly in Northern Ireland and Scotland from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration of housing is subject to building
regulations laid down by the Government. Building in the private sector is
regulated by an independent organisation, the National House-Building Coun¬
cil, which sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the Council’s insurance scheme
which provides ten-year guarantees against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will only make
a loan for purchase of a new house if it is covered by the Council’s certificate.
Local authorities are responsible for the payment of house renovation grants
and the implementation of housing renewal programmes. Many have housing
advisory centres to provide information on aspects of housing.
The number of people owning their own homes has more than trebled in the last
35 years, and the number of owner-occupied dwellings in Great Britain
amounted to over 13-5 million at the end of 1985, compared with 4 million in
1951. Most public sector tenants have the right to buy the homes they occupy at
discounts which vary according to the length of their occupancy. Local
authorities have been asked to encourage low-cost home ownership by selling
land to builders to construct homes for ‘first-time’ buyers, or to individuals or
groups to build their own ‘first-time’ homes in partnership with private
builders; by improving homes for sale; by selling dilapidated homes for
improvement by the purchaser (‘homesteading’); by offering shared ownership
(part owning, part renting); and by using local authority guarantee powers to
facilitate lending by building societies and other financial institutions.

Mortgage Loans
Public Sector
Housing
In Northern Ireland shared ownership has been developed in the public sector
by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and in the private sector by the
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association. The Executive has offered
most of its homes for sale to the tenants; over 32,700 have been sold.
Most people buy their homes with a mortgage loan (for which the properties are
regarded as securities) from such sources as building societies, banks,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies, and local authorities.
Some companies also make loans for house purchase to their own employees.
Building societies are by far the largest sources of such loans, their share of
the market being about 78 per cent in 1986. For first-time buyers they usually
advance about 90 per cent of their valuation of a property with the help of an
appropriate insurance guarantee but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent.
Loans are normally repayable over periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years
in certain circumstances) by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and
interest. Ordinary mortgage loans from building societies are usually available
to purchasers on average income or above. People with insufficient income to
obtain a mortgage for outright purchase may be able to participate in a scheme
in which a housing association buys the home and sells a share in it to them,
allowing them to rent the remainder and to purchase it later if they wish.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on interest payments arising on up
to £30,000 of their mortgage loans (on their main home only). Under the
Homeloan Scheme first-time home buyers who have saved for two years and are
buying a home in the lower price range may qualify for an extra loan of £600
interest-free for up to five years, and a tax-free bonus of up to £110.
Most of the public housing in Great Britain is provided by 460 local housing
authorities. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London), the
district councils; in London, the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London; and in Scotland, the district and islands councils.
Other public housing authorities are the new town authorities, the Scottish
Special Housing Association, which supplements building by local authorities
in Scotland, and the Development Board for Rural Wales. The Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is responsible for the provision and management of public
housing in Northern Ireland.
Subsidies may be made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout. Public housing
authorities own about 6 million houses and flats. The number of homes owned
by each authority varies widely, from 141 homes in the Isles of Scilly to 165,000
in Glasgow. Most authorities own between 2,500 and 15,000 dwellings.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction and of
modernisation of their existing stock by raising loans on the open market, by
borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board (an independent statutory body
set up to make loans to local authorities) or from the capital receipts generated
by the sale of local authority houses and housing land. Current expenditure,
including maintenance and management costs and loan interest and repay¬
ment, is met from rents, which may be supplemented by subsidies from the
Government and, where required to balance housing revenue accounts, from
the rates. Local authorities are required to charge their tenants reasonable rents
(which keep a balance between the interests of tenants and ratepayers).
Sheltered housing (usually accommodation with an alarm system and
resident warden) is provided for those elderly people who need this degree of
support, but increasing emphasis is being placed on schemes to help elderly
people to continue to live in their own homes and on schemes to adapt existing
housing to meet the housing needs of physically handicapped people. Local

authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that accommodation (not necessarily
owned by the authority) is available for homeless people who have dependent
children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
The Housing Act 1980 (consolidated in the Housing Act 1985) established a
charter for public sector tenants in England and Wales, giving them statutory
rights which include security of tenure, provision for a resident member of the
tenant’s family to succeed to the tenancy on the death of the tenant, rights of
subletting and taking in lodgers, and, at the landlord’s discretion, reimburse¬
ment for improvements made by the tenant. With a few exceptions, public sector
tenants of at least two years’ standing can buy their house or flat at a discount
which depends on the length of occupation. Similar provisions are made for
Scotland and Northern Ireland under separate legislation. By the end of 1986
over 1 million council, housing association and new town homes had been sold.
A National Mobility Scheme, sponsored by the Department of the Environ¬
ment, the Scottish Development Department, the Welsh Office and the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, was introduced in 1981 to
assist tenants who need to move to another area for employment or social
reasons. Tenants who wish to move by exchanging homes are able to make use
of the Tenants Exchange Scheme, a free computer-based national information
scheme, introduced in 1982.
There has been a steady decline in the number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords (including tied accommodation), from over 50 per cent of the
housing stock in 1951 to less than 10 per cent in 1987 (under 2 million
dwellings). Major factors have been the increased demand for owner-occupation,
the greater availability of public rented housing and the operation of rent
restriction. Privately rented dwellings are predominantly found in older hous¬
ing. Many landlords are individuals owning a small amount of property, but
some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, including property
companies. It is the Government’s policy to increase the availability of privately
rented accommodation and it is encouraging a greater variety of agencies to let
such accommodation.
Most private lettings are subject to the system of protection provided by the
Rent Act 1977 (and similar legislation in Scotland) and associated legislation.
Where the letting is a fully protected ‘regulated tenancy’, the tenant or the
landlord may apply for a ‘fair rent’ to be fixed by independent rent officers and
there is a wide degree of security of tenure. More limited provisions apply where
there is a resident landlord, when a ‘reasonable rent’ may be fixed by a rent
tribunal (in Scotland by a rent assessment committee). The Housing Act 1980
(and similar legislation for Scotland and Northern Ireland) introduced an
additional system of‘shorthold’ lettings, giving tenants security of tenure for an
agreed period of between one and five years, after which the landlord is
guaranteed repossession. The 1980 Act also introduced for England and Wales
the system of‘assured’ tenancies, which allows approved bodies to let newly built
property at freely negotiated rents outside the Rent Acts. At the beginning of
1987 this scheme was extended to cover improved properties. Tenants and most
other residential occupiers may not be evicted without a court order. Harass¬
ment of residential occupiers is a criminal offence. Occupiers may, depending
on their personal circumstances, be eligible for housing benefit to assist them in
paying their rent and rates.
In Northern Ireland only certain pre-1956 properties subject to rent restriction
come under statutory control, and rent levels are linked to those of the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive. Rent increases are permitted only for properties
which meet a prescribed standard. There is an uncontrolled rent sector,
comprising mostly furnished accommodation.
THE ENVIRONMENT

Housing
Associations
Improving
Older Houses
Housing associations extend the choice of housing by providing accommodation
available for rent or sale through new building or the rehabilitation of older
property. The associations normally cater for people who would otherwise look to
a local authority for a home, and also provide particularly for the special needs of
elderly, disabled and single people.
The associations, which are non-profit-making, have grown under govern¬
ment encouragement and now own some 500,000 homes. Individual associa¬
tions range in size from a group of ‘almshouses’ for fewer than ten old people to
associations with more than 10,000 homes. In Great Britain housing schemes
carried out by associations qualify for government grant if the association is one
of over 2,600 registered with the Housing Corporation, a statutory body. Most
rented homes owned by housing associations come within the fair rent
arrangements, and most housing association tenants have rights under the
tenants' charter in the Housing Act 1985—in Scotland the Tenants’ Rights, Etc
(Scotland) Act 1980—including, in some cases, the right to buy or the possibility
of a discount on the purchase of an alternative home. Housing associations also
provide accommodation on a shared ownership basis, allowing the occupier to
part-rent and part-own a home, and they can purchase improved older
properties for outright sale. Both activities are eligible for government grants.
In Northern Ireland assistance is available to associations registered with the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. Rent levels are linked to
those of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Tenants have rights under a
tenants’ charter, but not the right to buy, although housing associations may
sell their dwellings voluntarily.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment used to be major
features of housing policy. Large-scale clearance is now virtually at an end,
although there are still pockets of unfit housing for which demolition is
considered the best solution. Greater emphasis has been placed on the retention
of existing communities accompanied by the modernisation and conversion of
sub-standard homes. Although housing conditions have improved considerably,
problems remain in some areas where there are high concentrations of dwellings
lacking basic amenities or requiring substantial repairs.
More recently there has been concern about the problems associated with
high-density local authority estates in inner city areas or on the outskirts of
cities, some of which have not been popular with tenants, and about serious
structural defects found in some local authority dwellings. Authorities are
tackling these problems in a variety of ways including refurbishment and sale to
the private sector.
The Government’s Estate Action Initiative, which started in 1985, is working
with local authorities to deal with the problems of their run-down council
estates. Measures which are being developed include local housing management
along the lines of the Department of the Environment’s Priority Estates Project
(see below); the injection of private sector skills and resources; capital
investment in the refurbishment of the housing stock; community refurbish¬
ment schemes to enable previously unemployed people to work on environmen¬
tal improvements; the development of tenant management and ownership
co-operatives; and measures to increase the diversification of tenures on estates.
The Priority Estates Project was set up in England in 1979 (with similar
arrangements for Wales set up in 1983) to promote locally based housing
management, under which control of landlords’ services in council housing is
devolved to a locally based management team. Estate budgeting and accounting
are essential elements, together with the involvement of tenants. There are 30
experimental projects on estates in England and Wales, and an increasing
number of local authorities are applying local management to their own estates.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Over 900,000 home improvement grants were paid to householders in Great
Britain between 1980 and mid-1987. There are four types of grant: improvement
grants, for carrying out improvements to a good standard: intermediate grants,
for the provision of standard amenities (such as a bath and an inside lavatory)
and associated repairs: repair grants for substantial and structural repairs to
pre-1919 houses (pre-1957 in Northern Ireland and pre-1964 in Scotland, where
a grant can cover all forms of repair work): and special grants for providing
standard amenities and repairs (not available in Scotland) and means of escape
from fire in houses which are in multiple occupation. In addition, since 1978
grants for loft insulation have been paid in respect of some 3-5 million homes.
Declaring ‘general improvement areas’ and ‘housing action areas’ enables local
authorities in England and Wales to tackle the improvement of whole areas of
older housing systematically. General improvement areas, of which there are
more than 1,700, contain fundamentally sound houses and a stable population,
while housing action areas (of which there are about 260 in England and Wales)
are characterised by relatively poor housing and bad environmental conditions
combined with social stress. Local authorities have special powers to bring
about an improvement in living conditions for the benefit of residents. In both
types of area government financial aid for environmental improvement (such as
landscaping and work to improve the external appearance of buildings) is
available to local authorities. In these areas home improvement grants may
range up to 75 per cent of the eligible expense limit, and in certain cases of
hardship up to 90 per cent. Enveloping’, introduced in 1982, involves the
renovation of the external fabric of whole terraces or streets of mainly privately
owned property in housing action areas which has deteriorated beyond routine
maintenance. It is carried out by local authorities at public expense, and the
encouragement it gives to residents is reflected in the increased take-up of
grants for improvements to the interiors after enveloping.
An ‘improvement-for-sale’ scheme has also been introduced; the Government
helps to meet any loss a local authority may make in buying, improving and
selling run-down or neglected housing.
In Scotland housing action area powers are available for the improvement of
areas in which at least half the houses fail to meet a statutory tolerable standard.
Since 1975 some 1,580 housing action areas, covering houses requiring
improvement or demolition, have been declared by local authorities. Outside
such areas in Scotland local authorities have powers to require the improvement
of houses below the statutory tolerable standard, or lacking certain basic
amenities, by improvement orders. In housing action areas or where an
improvement order has been made, grants of 75 per cent (up to 90 per cent in
cases of hardship) of the eligible expense limit may be made. Government
financial aid is also given towards the costs incurred by local authorities in
improving the environment of predominantly residential areas.
Northern Ireland has a major problem of derelict and unfit housing, especially
in Belfast, the situation having been made worse by civil disturbance. Concerted
measures are being taken in housing action areas, and there is a continuing
programme of rehabilitation in Belfast. Housing receives priority in Northern
Ireland’s social and environmental programme.
Conservation
Britain is one of the leading countries in the conservation movement. A wide
range of groups, including many voluntary organisations, are active in it. The
Council for Environmental Conservation is a national coalition of non¬
governmental organisations which focuses attention on major issues.

Lists of buildings of special architectural or historical interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; some 400,000 buildings are
listed in England, over 35,000 in Scotland and 10,600 in Wales. It is against the
law to demolish, extend or alter the character of any listed building without
special consent from the local planning authority or the appropriate Secretary of
State; where consent is given to demolish a building, the Royal Commission on
Historical Monuments (for England) and similar bodies for Scotland and Wales
have an opportunity to make a photographic and written record of the building.
Emergency ‘building preservation notices' can be served by the local planning
authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
Maintaining royal parks (which are open to the public) and palaces is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and
Wales. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (known
as English Heritage) is charged with protecting and conserving England’s
architectural and archaeological heritage; it manages some 400 ancient
monuments on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment and gives
grants for the repair of ancient monuments, historic buildings and buildings in
conservation areas in England. In Scotland and Wales similar functions are
performed by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Directorate of the Scottish
Development Department and by Cadw (Welsh Historic Monuments) with advice
from an ancient monuments board and a historic buildings council for each
country. Local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of
architectural or historic interest. The National Heritage Memorial Fund provides
assistance towards the cost of acquiring, maintaining, or preserving land,
buildings, works of art and other items of outstanding interest which are also of
importance to the national heritage. In 1986—87 the Fund assisted in the
preservation of about 90 heritage items and gave assistance, for example, to
secure the preservation of Kedleston Hall (Derbyshire), Nostell Priory (West
Yorkshire) and Weston Park (Shropshire) through an additional £25 million
given to the Fund by the Government in 1985, together with a further £10-5
million in 1986.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection about 6,000
‘conservation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available from the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for
works which make a significant contribution towards the preservation or
enhancement of such an area.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland
has 160 historic monuments in its care, and some 750 monuments are
scheduled for protection. It is also responsible for listing buildings of special
architectural or historic interest and for designating conservation areas; there
are some 7,000 listed buildings and 25 conservation areas. It may also provide
grants and loans to help with the repair and maintenance of listed buildings and
to preserve or enhance conservation areas. It has the advice of a Historic
Buildings Council and a Historic Monuments Council.
Among the voluntary organisations which campaign for the preservation of
buildings are the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient
Monuments Society; the Georgian Group; the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland; the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society;
and the Council for British Archaeology. The National Trust (for Places of
Historic Interest or Natural Beauty), an independent charity with more than
1 -4 million members, owns and protects some 200 historic buildings in addition
to 246,900 hectares (more than 610,000 acres) of land and 777 km (483 miles)
of coastline in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Scotland has its own
National Trust.

Besides helping to conserve the finest buildings inherited from the past, the
Government encourages high standards in new building. The Department of the
Environment, in collaboration with the independent Royal Institute of British
Architects (RIBA) and the National House-Building Council, sponsors the
biennial Housing Design Awards Scheme for England and Northern Ireland,
with categories for renovation as well as new building. Scotland and Wales have
similar but separate awards schemes. The Government has also encouraged the
use of architectural competitions, and has set an example in the award of some
of its own contracts. Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for
Scotland advise government departments, planning authorities and other
public bodies on questions of public amenity or artistic importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional body for architects, exercises control over
standards in architectural education and encourages the maintenance of high
architectural standards in the profession. The Royal Incorporation of Architects
in Scotland is allied to it, as is the Royal Society of Ulster Architects. The Civic
Trust, with associate trusts in Scotland. Wales and north-east and north-west
England, encourages high standards in urban design and the protection and
improvement of the environment.
Local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands in the
interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
appropriate, ensure adequate provision for the preservation or planting of trees.
In general, landowners must replace trees which die or are removed, uprooted or
destroyed in contravention of a preservation order.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
neighbouring towns merging into one another, or to preserve the special
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts' (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from
inappropriate building development and where people can seek recreation) have
been established on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London's green
belt, for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which is used for
recreation. Some 1-9 million hectares (4-7 million acres) of land have been
designated as green belt in Great Britain.
In 1987 guidance was given to encourage alternative uses of farmland and a
more diverse rural economy and rural enterprise. The Government’s commit¬
ment to the protection of green belts was also reiterated; its intention is to
permit green belt development applications only when these relate to the rural
community or to leisure.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use at
the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline against erosion is administered
centrally by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office and
the Scottish Office.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken by
the Countryside Commission (see p 197) in 1966—70. recommended that
certain stretches of undeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Jointly with local authorities, the Commission has
defined 38 of these coasts so far, protecting 1.263 km (784 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to raise
funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural beauty and

recreational value. More than £10 million has been raised so far and as a result
the Trust has under its protection 710 km (441 miles) of coastline in England
and Wales. As part of the campaign, relaunched in 1985, the Trust is raising
funds to acquire a further 671 km (417 miles) considered at risk. Some 128 km
(80 miles) of coast in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with
the National Trust for Scotland. In Northern Ireland 66 km (41 miles) of coast
and coastal path have been acquired by the National Trust.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; development
associated with North Sea oil and gas is occurring on remote and unspoiled
coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but planning guidelines drawn up by the
Scottish Development Department aim to ensure that oil-related activities are
sited so as to make the best use of existing labour and infrastructure and to
minimise the effect on the coastline. Provision has also been made for funds to
be set aside for the restoration of sites once there is no further need for them.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for conserving and enhancing the natural beauty and
amenity of the countryside, and for encouraging the provision and improvement
of facilities for open-air recreation in the countryside. These include the
provision by local authorities (sometimes in association with other bodies) and
private individuals of country parks and picnic sites often within easy reach of
towns; the provision or improvement of recreational paths; the encouragement
of amenity tree-planting schemes; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals
and other waterways for bathing, sailing and other activities. The Countryside
Commission recognises 206 country parks and 240 picnic sites in England and
Wales. In Scotland 34 country parks are recognised and a large number of local
authority and private sector schemes for the provision of a variety of countryside
facilities have been approved for grant aid. The Commissions undertake
research projects and experimental schemes, working in consultation with local
authorities and such bodies as the Nature Conservancy Council (see p 198) and
the Sports Councils. The Commissions give financial assistance to public,
private and voluntary bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recrea¬
tion and amenity projects, and landscape conservation projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
'areas of outstanding natural beauty’; to define heritage coasts in conjunction
with local authorities (see p 196); and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished, covering 13,600 sq km (5,250 sq miles), 9 per cent of the area of England
and Wales, and 36 areas of outstanding natural beauty have been designated
and confirmed, covering 17,000 sq km (6,600 sq miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures, for
which grants are available, such as tree planting and the removal of eyesores. In
the national parks other measures for the benefit of the public include the
provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas, and information centres. All
national parks and some other designated areas have warden services. Most
local authority expenditure on national parks is met by government grants.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment on the preservation of amenities and the designation
of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural

beauty have been designated, covering 259,500 hectares (641,000 acres), and
seven areas are being managed as country parks and one as a regional park.
In Scotland there are no national parks as such, but there are two regional
parks and 40 ‘national scenic areas’, covering more than 1 million hectares (2-5
million acres), or 13 per cent of the country, where certain kinds of development
are subject to consultation with the Countryside Commission for Scotland, and
in the event of a disagreement, with the Secretary of State for Scotland. More
than 98 per cent of the land in Scotland is designated countryside within which
the Commission may provide grants for a wide range of countryside projects.
There are seven forest parks in Great Britain, covering some 243,000 hectares
(600,000 acres) and administered by the Forestry Commission, and nine in
Northern Ireland administered by the Forest Service of the Department of
Agriculture. Camping and other recreational facilities are provided.
Many voluntary organisations are concerned to preserve the amenities of the
countryside; they include the Councils for the Protection of Rural England and
of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland and the
Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare and keep under
review definitive maps showing public rights of way; they are also responsible for
keeping rights of way free from obstruction, and signposted. If a path is not
shown on the map, a private citizen may claim that it is a public right of way if it
has been regarded as such and used without hindrance for at least 20 years.
Public footpaths are maintained by local authorities, which also supervise
landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths, close paths no longer needed for public use and divert paths to
meet the needs of either the public or landowners. Local planning authorities
can also convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve the
amenities of their area. There are 14 approved long-distance footpaths and
bridleways in England and Wales covering some 2,700 km (1,685 miles) and
three approved long-distance routes in Scotland covering some 580 km
(360 miles). Voluntary organisations concerned with footpaths include the
Open Spaces Society, the Scottish Rights of Way Society and the Ramblers
Association.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, although many
landowners permit more or less free access. Local planning authorities can
secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements cannot be
obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public access. Similar
powers cover Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1 -5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually privately
owned, but people other than the owner may have various rights on or over it, for
example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by law and cannot
be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries of State for the
Environment or Wales.
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council, which has the functions of establishing, main¬
taining and managing nature reserves, advising the Government, providing
general information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research.
There are 228 national nature reserves covering some 160,400 hectares
(396,400 acres). Some 5,000 sites of special scientific interest have been notified
for their flora, fauna or geological or physiographieal features.
The Forestry Commission has 344 sites of special scientific interest on its land

(covering 70,000 hectares - 173,000 acres) on which nature conservation is a
primary objective of management. Local authorities have declared about 130
local nature reserves. Voluntary nature conservation trusts and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds play an important part in protecting wildlife,
having established between them some 1,800 reserves. The trusts are affiliated
to a parent organisation, the Royal Society for Nature Conservation. The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, with nearly 500,000 members and 87,000
young ornithologists, is the largest voluntary wildlife conservation body in
Europe.
In Northern Ireland the Committee for Nature Conservation advises the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland on nature conservation
matters including the establishment and management of terrestrial and marine
nature reserves and the declaration of areas of special scientific interest.
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 extended the list of protected species,
restricted the introduction into the countryside of animals or plants not
normally found in the wild and afforded greater protection for areas of special
scientific interest and other important habitats. In Northern Ireland two orders,
which became operative in 1985, have brought legislation into line with the rest
of Britain on species and habitat protection.
Other conservation measures promoted by the Government have included a
ban (in conjunction with other European Community countries) on the import
of whale products and certain seal pup products, a system of licensing zoos to
ensure that captive animals are kept in suitable conditions, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds. Certain areas, of importance for their landscape,
historic and habitat value, are being designated ‘environmentally sensitive
areas’ as a result of a change in European Community regulations allowing
governments to make special payments to farmers to continue their traditional
farming methods for the sake of preserving the countryside and its wildlife. The
first nine designations came into force in March 1987 and further areas were
announced in May 1987.
Britain is participating in the European Year of the Environment (from March
1987 to March 1988), which aims to raise public awareness of environmental
issues and of the individual’s responsibility for the present and future quality of
the environment. Among issues that are being highlighted are nature conserva¬
tion, the control of pollution and wastes, and the improvement of the urban
environment.
Derelict land is often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth-century
industrial development, but the restructuring of particular industries over the
past decade or so is continuing to add significantly to this problem in certain
areas. Dereliction can take various forms and can include mineral waste tips, old
mineral workings, former industrial sites such as steelworks, disused railways
and docks, and contaminated sites.
In England, central government grants are available under the Derelict Land
Act 1982 to local authorities and to other public bodies, to the private sector and
to nationalised industries for the reclamation of derelict land in order to bring it
into beneficial use or to improve its appearance. The expenditure provision for
the derelict land reclamation programme in 1987—88 is £81 million. The main
priority is given to reclamation schemes in urban, particularly inner city, areas
that lead to development by the private sector for industry, commerce and
especially housing. Between 1 April 1979 and 31 March 1987 some 10,800
hectares (over 26,000 acres) of derelict land were reclaimed in England with the
aid of some £390 million of derelict land grant.
In Scotland and Wales responsibility for derelict land reclamation rests with
the respective development agencies, which may acquire and reclaim land.

employ local authorities as their agents (in Scotland) or make grants to local
authorities for the purpose (in Wales). In Northern Ireland grants may be paid to
landowners who restore or improve derelict sites.
To prevent new dereliction, planning controls require that when permission is
given for mineral working, various measures must be taken to minimise the
disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restoration is
practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of land for
disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting the height
of waste tips or requiring treatment of waste on completion of workings.
In Wales, land use is additionally encouraged by the Land Authority for Wales,
a statutory body with powers to make land available for development in
circumstances where the private sector would find this difficult or impossible.
In England the Government has instituted, and made available for inspection,
registers of under-used land held by local authorities, nationalised industries
and other public bodies; some 60,000 hectares (149,000 acres) have been
registered. Of this, some 20,230 hectares (50,000 acres) have been deregistered
mainly because the land has been sold to the private sector or brought into use.
There is power to direct a public body to dispose of registered land; directions in
respect of some 40 sites had been issued by January 1987. Registers are also
published for certain areas of Wales.
In 1986 the Government launched a new initiative to encourage a wide range of
local environmental improvement work which is being undertaken both by
volunteers and by Manpower Services Commission Community Programme
teams. The initiative, called UK 2000, brings together representatives of
voluntary organisations and independent members from business. It aims to
improve the natural and built environment and people’s enjoyment of it, create
jobs, and provide work and training for the participants. Voluntary organisa¬
tions promote programmes of work and assist in the setting up of local projects
such as creating parks, footpaths and other areas of greenery in cities,
conserving the industrial heritage and the natural environment, tackling litter
problems, recycling waste, and providing tourist information and facilities.
Control of Pollution
Government measures to control environmental pollution are long established,
and are complementary to the planning system and the various measures to
conserve amenities and the country’s heritage.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to England, Scotland and
Wales, sets out a wide range of powers and duties for local and water authorities,
including control over wastes, air and water pollution and noise, and contains
important provisions on the release of information to the public on environmen¬
tal conditions. In particular, it introduced a new system for the comprehensive
planning of waste disposal operations so as to ensure that disposal is carried out
to satisfactory standards and that where practicable waste materials are
recovered and recycled. The Act also increased the penalties for a large number
of pollution offences. The provisions relating to noise and air pollution are fully
in force, as are the most important relating to water and a substantial number of
those relating to waste on land. Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
Executive responsibility for pollution control rests in general with local and
water authorities, although certain registered industrial processes are con¬
trolled by central government agencies. Local authorities are responsible for
THE ENVIRONMENT
201
The Land
Recycling and
Materials

matters such as collection and disposal of domestic wastes; control of air
pollution from domestic and certain non-registered industrial premises; and
noise abatement measures. Sewerage and sewage treatment and disposal are
the responsibilities of regional water authorities in England and Wales, of local
authorities in Scotland and of the Department of the Environment in Northern
Ireland. The regional water authorities in England, the Welsh Water Authority,
the river purification boards and islands councils in Scotland and the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland are responsible for control
of water pollution.
An independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and international matters concerning the
pollution of the environment, on the adequacy of research and on the future
possibilities of danger to the environment. It has so far produced 11 reports
covering a wide range of topics.
Central government is principally concerned with formulating policy, exercis¬
ing general budgetary control, promoting the necessary legislation, and advising
pollution control authorities on its implementation. The Secretary of State for
the Environment has general responsibility for co-ordinating the work of the
Government on environmental protection and in this is assisted by a Central
Directorate of Environmental Protection within the Department. In Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland the respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for pollution control co-ordination in their countries. They are assisted by the
Scottish Development Department, the Water and Environmental Protection
Division of the Welsh Office, and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland respectively. On 1 April 1987 the former Industrial Air
Pollution Inspectorate (of the Health and Safety Executive), the Radiochemical
Inspectorate and the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate were amalgamated in a
single unified inspectorate for England and Wales known as the Inspectorate of
Pollution.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, careless disposal of pesticides and chemicals, and the
deposition of materials from the atmosphere and from flood-water. The Control
of Pollution Act places a duty on waste disposal authorities to arrange for the
disposal of controlled wastes. It requires them to draw up and revise periodically
a waste disposal plan and establishes a licensing system for waste disposal sites,
treatment plants and storage facilities receiving controlled wastes. In addition,
it provides for a more intensive control system for certain especially hazardous
or difficult wastes. The Inspectorate of Pollution and the Hazardous Waste
Inspectorate for Scotland advise local authorities on how to improve their
control of waste management and to work towards environmentally acceptable
standards for dealing with hazardous wastes.
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any public place in the open air or to
dump rubbish except in designated places. To help counteract the problem of
litter, financial support is given to the Keep Britain Tidy Group, which provides
a comprehensive litter abatement programme in collaboration with local
authorities and secures sponsorship from industry to undertake litter abate¬
ment promotions. The Group is also included in UK 2000 (see p 200).
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce waste disposal
costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already makes
considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and textiles.
Local authorities reclaim about 40,000 tonnes of waste paper and about 50,000
tonnes of metals annually. In an increasing number of areas there are ‘bottle
202
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Water Pollution
Marine
Pollution
banks’ and ‘can banks' where the public can deposit used glass and metal
containers respectively. Voluntary organisations also arrange collections of
waste material. Waste disposal authorities have powers under the Control of
Pollution Act to take full account of opportunities for waste reclamation and
have a duty when drawing up their waste disposal plans to include information
on disposal methods which should be used, including reclamation.
There has been a steady and significant improvement in water quality: the level
of pollution in the tidal Thames, for example, has been reduced to a quarter of
the 1950s’ level and over 100 different kinds of fish have been identified there
since 1964. A major scheme has been launched to clean up the Mersey, the
largest British estuary still suffering from severe pollution, and programmes
aimed at considerably improving water quality in the Tyne and Tees are also in
progress. Discharges of polluting matter into rivers and estuaries have been
controlled for many years and recently powers have been extended to provide full
control over discharges into underground and coastal waters. Information on all
aspects of water pollution is publicly available on registers maintained by the
individual water authorities and by the river purification authorities in
Scotland. More than 95 per cent of the population is provided with main
drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works serve over four-fifths of
the population—a very high proportion by international standards.
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international
conventions drawn up under the auspices of the International Maritime
Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in London, and
implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The Merchant Shipping
(Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 1983 and the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1986 make it an offence for ships of any nationality to discharge oil
or oily mixtures into British territorial waters and for British registered ships to
make similar discharges anywhere into the sea, except in accordance with the
regulations.
The Department of Transport's Marine Pollution Control Unit, set up in 1979,
undertakes operations at sea to counter pollution when oil (or other dangerous
substances) threatens major coastal pollution or is likely to harm important
fisheries or concentrations of sea birds. It maintains a national contingency
plan and dispersant spraying, cargo transfer and mechanical recovery re¬
sources. It also maintains specialist beach cleaning equipment to assist local
authorities (which have the primary role in dealing with oil and chemical
pollution of beaches and inshore waters), finances a research programme,
advises on the contingency plans of local authorities and offshore operators, and
provides training to local authority staff in beach cleaning management and
techniques.
Offshore operators must ensure that oil does not escape into the sea and are
required to have contingency plans for dealing with oil spilled accidentally.
Discharges containing oil are controlled under the Prevention of Oil Pollution
Act 1971. Discharges of chemicals are controlled and monitored by a non-
statutory Chemical Notification Scheme, administered by the Department of
Energy in consultation with fisheries departments.
The Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (which superseded the
Dumping at Sea Act 1974) tightened the controls over dumping at sea, the most
significant change being the introduction of specific controls on marine
incineration. Under the Act a licence has to be obtained for the permanent
deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at sea
is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the annexes to the
Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Marine
THE ENVIRONMENT
203
Clean Air
Noise
Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the London
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and
Other Matter 1972.
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke control areas’ within
which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes an offence. About
two-thirds of the premises in conurbations are now covered by smoke control
orders. Emissions from most industrial premises are also subject to the control
of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts and the Public Health Acts. The
emission of dark smoke from any trade or industrial premises or from the
chimney of any building is in general prohibited, and new furnaces must be
capable as far as practicable of smokeless operation. The height of the chimney
serving a new furnace must generally be approved by the local authority, and
approved grit and dust arrestment plant has to be installed. Regulations
prescribe specific limits to the quantities of grit and dust which may be emitted
from certain furnaces. Industrial premises that have the greatest potential for
giving rise to noxious or offensive emissions are, in England and Wales, under
the control of the Inspectorate of Pollution. In Scotland this function is
discharged by the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate. The Inspectorates require
the best practicable means to be used to prevent emissions or render them
harmless. Similar legislation and controls apply in Northern Ireland.
Strict controls are in force on emissions from motor vehicles, and Britain has
played a constructive role in European Community discussions on tighter
limits. The maximum permitted lead content of petrol in Britain was reduced to
015 grammes per litre on 31 December 1985. The European Community has
adopted a directive which requires the introduction of unleaded petrol
throughout the Community by October 1989. The first unleaded petrol in
Britain went on sale at selected service stations in 1986.
Considerable progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air
and a better environment, especially in the last 30 years or so. Total emissions of
smoke in the air have fallen by over 85 per cent since 1960. The domestic smoke
control programme has been particularly important in achieving this result.
London no longer has the dense smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in central
London winter sunshine has increased by about 50 per cent since 1958. Similar
improvement has been achieved in other cities including Glasgow and Sheffield.
National sulphur dioxide emissions have fallen by about 40 per cent since 1970.
The Government intends to achieve further reductions of 30 per cent from the
1980 levels of emissions of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by the end
of the 1990s.
Britain is supporting an extensive research programme into the causes and
effects of acid rain, and the likely results of possible abatement technologies. It is
also participating in international research programmes and monitoring
schemes. The Government has announced measures to reduce sulphur and
nitrogen emissions from power stations. Flue gas desulphurisation equipment
is to be fitted to three existing coal-fired power stations, and over the next ten
years low nitrogen oxide burners are to be installed at the 12 largest power
stations. This equipment will be a requirement for all new fossil-fuel fired power
stations.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974 (and similar legislation in Northern Ireland)
requires local authorities to inspect their areas for noise nuisance and gives
them the power to deal with it. It also enables them to designate ‘noise
abatement zones' within which registered levels of noise from certain premises
may not be increased without their permission. The Act contains specific
204
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Radioactivity
Radioactive
Waste
Disposal
provisions to control noise from construction and demolition sites. It also
contains provisions enabling individuals to take action against noise amount¬
ing to a nuisance.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and control
measures are aimed at reducing noise at source, through requirements limiting
the noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may make, and at protecting people
from its effects. The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 set
out the permissible noise levels for various classes of vehicles when new and
when in use. More stringent limits will begin to take effect for new vehicles in
1988.
Under the Land Compensation Act 1973 and similar legislation in Scotland,
compensation is payable for loss in property values caused by physical factors
including noise arising from the use of new or improved public works such as
roads and airports. Regulations made under the Acts also enable highway
authorities to carry out or make grants for insulation of homes subject to
specified levels of increased noise caused by new or improved roads. Noise
insulation may also be provided where construction work for new roads is likely
to seriously affect nearby homes.
Noise emission levels of almost all aircraft on the United Kingdom Register are
regulated in accordance with standards agreed by the International Civil
Aviation Organisation. Since 1986 all subsonic jets on the United Kingdom
Register have had to comply with these standards, and this requirement is to be
extended to overseas-registered aircraft from 1 January 1988. Various oper¬
ational restrictions have been introduced to reduce noise disturbance further.
Radiation resulting from industrial and other processes represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is exposed from the natural environ¬
ment. Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to stringent control because of
possible effects on health or longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1960 most users of radioactive materials other than those
subject to licence under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 must be registered by
the appropriate department, and authorisation is also required for the disposal
of radioactive waste. The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned with the granting of
nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence granted by the Executive. The
National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), established under the Radiolo¬
gical Protection Act 1970, provides an authoritative point of reference on
radiological protection. In January 1987 the Government announced a series of
measures to deal with the problem of naturally occurring radon gas in houses,
including a survey by the NRPB to identify houses with the highest levels where
remedial action would be necessary.
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and level of activity, and the practices
followed reflect this variation. Some wastes are dispersed safely in the
environment. The Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive (UK Nirex Ltd)
is responsible for developing and operating disposal facilities for solid wastes
with a low or intermediate level of activity and is seeking to identify a suitable
location for a deep multi-purpose facility. UK Nirex Ltd is evaluating the relative
merits of techniques of deep burial in a repository on land, tunnelling under the
sea-bed from the shore, and disposal into the sea-bed from a sea-based rig. The
Department of the Environment is also sponsoring research, in collaboration
with other countries, into disposal of high-level wastes, but these will first be
stored in vitrified form for at least 50 years.

The Church of
England
Religion
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship and
observance) without interference from the community or the State. Churches
and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their
beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the
holding of public office.
There are two established churches, that is, churches legally recognised as
official churches of the State: in England the (Anglican) Church of England, and
in Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. Clergy of the established
churches work in services administered by the State, such as the armed forces,
national hospitals and prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other
denominations are also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds. The
churches’ involvement in broader social issues and the practical help they give to
groups of many kinds—from young people to the bereaved and homeless—was
highlighted in the Church of England report Faith in the City: A Call for Action
by Church and Nation, published in 1985. This made recommendations for
alleviating the problems of the inner cities and other areas of social deprivation
and led to a decision by the Church of England in 1986 to set up an urban aid
fund with the aim of raising £10 million in capital for its work in inner city and
other priority areas.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are normally made about religious beliefs in
censuses or other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in
counting its members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore
approximate.
About one-sixth of the adult population in Britain are members of a Christian
church and there are considerable regional variations in church membership:
England has the lowest membership with 13 per cent, Wales has 23 per cent,
Scotland 37 per cent, and Northern Ireland the highest with 80 per cent.
There has been a decline in recent years in both the number of full¬
time ministers and the recorded adult membership of the larger Christian de¬
nominations. This has been accompanied by a significant growth among
small break-away, independent, or Pentecostal churches and new religious
movements. However, the churches today share a strong desire to work together
and the ecumenical movement is well supported. Religious education in schools
is required by statute in England, Wales and Scotland, but the subject has
increasingly become concerned with religious and moral attitudes and values,
often taking into account many different faiths, rather than simply being a
vehicle for instruction in the Christian faith.
The Church of England’s relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain duties which
it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the Church, and
promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister: all clergy take an
206
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Communion
oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate its own worship. The
two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan
bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church (together with those of
the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church)
are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses (includ¬
ing the Diocese of Europe), and York, with 14 dioceses. The Archbishop of
Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England', and the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of
England'. The dioceses are divided into 13,300 parishes. In 1985 it was
estimated that, in the two provinces (excluding the Diocese of Europe), some
238,000 people were baptised into the Church; of these 200,000 were under one
year old (32 per cent of live births). In the same year there were 76,900
confirmations. Attendances at services on a normal Sunday are around 1-2
million. Many people who rarely, if ever, attend services, nevertheless regard
themselves as belonging to the Church of England (amounting perhaps to some
60 per cent of the population).
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay members
are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred for the
approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod. Lay members are
associated with church government in the parishes through the ancient office of
churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with such
matters as education, mission, inter-church relations, social questions, recruit¬
ment and training for the ministry, church work in Britain and overseas and the
care of church buildings, particularly those of historical and architectural
interest. It is also concerned with church schools in England and Wales (which
are maintained from public funds) and colleges of education, theological
colleges, and centres for training women in pastoral work. At present, men only
are admitted to the priesthood, but in 1987 the General Synod voted to proceed
with legislation to enable women to be ordained priests; final decisions on the
matter, however, are not expected to be taken for some years.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
church property and matters of ecclesiastical discipline.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for
training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church's endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the
payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 28 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
70 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church in Scotland,
and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference meets for unofficial consultation
among all Anglican bishops (the next Conference will be held in Canterbury in
1988). Presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference has no
executive authority, but enjoys great prestige, and its findings on doctrine,
discipline, relations with other communions, and attitudes to political and
social questions are widely studied. The Anglican Consultative Council (an
assembly of laymen and clergy as well as bishops) meets every two or three years

The Church of

and is designed to provide consultations within the Anglican Communion and
to serve as an instrument of common action. The Council last met in Singapore
in 1987.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government, that is,
government by elders, all (including ministers) of equal rank. Its status as the
national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707, and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
Both men and women are admitted to the ministry and each of 1,745
churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and
the elected elders of the Church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the
Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly,
consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually under the
presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is
represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The adult
communicant membership of the Church of Scotland is over 854,300.
The expression ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe those Protestant
churches in Britain which, unlike the Church of England and the Church of
Scotland, are not established. In the course of history they have developed their
own convictions in church order and worship. All the major Free Churches—
Methodist, Baptist, United Reformed and Salvation Army—admit both men and
women to the ministry.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with nearly 458,600
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evangeli¬
cal revival under John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not join the
union include the Independent Methodists (4,200 members) and the Wesleyan
Reform Union (with some 3,300 members). The Methodist Church in Ireland
has over 20,560 members in Northern Ireland.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of which
belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in 1813), with a
total membership of about 170,300. In addition, there are separate Baptist
Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some 129,000 members, was formed in
1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century. In 1981 there was a further union with
the Re-formed Association of the Churches of Christ.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland; the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris; the Union of Welsh
Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland;
the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of
Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-
Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Fellowship of the Churches of Christ (known also in the United
States as Disciples of Christ), which has been an organised community in
Britain since the early nineteenth century; the British Province of the Moravian
Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free Church of
England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a direct

result of the Oxford Movement: and the Congregational Federation, formed from
Congregational Churches which did not enter the United Reformed Church.
There are also the Pentecostalists. who are increasing in numbers. Their two
main bodies operating in Britain are the Assemblies of God and the Elim
Pentecostal Church, many of whose members are of West Indian origin. There
are also a growing number of black-led churches.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with about 18.000 adult members
in Britain and 454 places of worship, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. Silent worship is
central to its life as a religious organisation and Friends work for peace and the
relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 88 other
countries. Within Britain there are 56.400 active members operating from
nearly 1,000 centres of worship. The Sahation Army's distinctive ministry of
Christian evangelism and practical care is also expressed through the work of
170 social service centres, ranging from hostels for the homeless to homes for
the elderly, for abused children and for teenagers on probation, and recreational
centres for Sendee personnel.
A recent development in Christian worship has been the house church
movement, which began in the early 1970s and now has an estimated
membership of over 89.000 attendance being considerably greater than
membership). Each house church has an average of 100 members, the majority
of whom are former members of various Protestant denominations; groups of
between 15 and 20 members hold sendees and prayer meetings in private
houses, wdth the position of chairman being taken in rotation. House churches
receive money from their members to enable them to support their leaders and
carry out missionary and social work.
There are also a number of other religious organisations in Britain all of which
were founded in the United States in the last century. These include the
Jehovah's Witnesses, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christian Scientists and the Spiritualists.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tempo¬
rarily extinct during the sLxteenth century', was restored in 1850: the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each
under an archbishop. 30 episcopal dioceses (22 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland), and over 3.000 parishes. In Northern Ireland, there are six dioceses,
some with territory partly in the Irish Republic. It is estimated that there are
some 5-7 million adherents to the Roman Catholic faith in Britain. Men only are
admitted to the priesthood. In 1982 Pope John Paul II paid a pastoral visit to
Britain, the first by a reigning pontiff.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of its
children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. A number of schools for Catholic children are staffed by members
of the religious orders (to the extent of one teacher in 20). These orders also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct
of homes for old people. The great majority of Catholic schools are maintained
out of public funds and new schools may be established with government
grants.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman Conquest, but the
present community in Britain dates from 1656. having been founded by those of
Spanish and Portuguese origin (known as Sephardim). Later and more

numerous settlers were of German and eastern European origin, known as
Ashkenazim. The present community, numbering about 330,000, is the second
largest in Europe.
The community is, broadly speaking, divided into two groups. About 80 per
cent of the majority Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and most acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Chief Rabbi, with the Sephardi Orthodox element following
their own spiritual head (the Haham). The Reform movement which was
founded in 1840 and the Liberal and Progressive movement which followed in
1901 account for the remaining 20 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number about 350. Jewish denominational
schools (some of them supported by public funds) are attended by about one in
three Jewish children. There are a number of charitable and welfare agencies
caring for the aged and handicapped.
The officially recognised representative body is the Board of Deputies of
British Jews.
Christian communities of foreign origin, including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries, together with the Armenian
Church, have established their own centres of worship, particularly in London.
Britain has a long tradition of religious tolerance, a feature which has been
much in evidence during the past 30 years with the acceptance of a wide variety
of religious beliefs and traditions brought in by substantial numbers of
immigrants of different nationalities. There are now large and growing
communities of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, and arrangements have been made
in places of work to allow the members of non-Christian religions to follow their
religious observances.
Britain's Muslim population is estimated at around 1-5 million, the largest
number of whom originate from Pakistan and Bangladesh, with sizeable groups
from India, Cyprus, the Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. There is also a
growing community of British-born Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, but including an increasing number of converts to Islam. The Islamic
Cultural Centre (and London Central Mosque) on the edge of Regent’s Park is the
most important Muslim institution in the Western world, and there are over
1,000 mosques and prayer centres throughout Britain.
There are large Sikh and Hindu communities in Britain, both of which mainly
originate from India, each with 150 or more temples throughout the country.
Sikhs form the largest religious group of the Indian community and their
temples cater for the religious, cultural and social needs of their community.
There are well over 150 Buddhist groups and centres and at least seven
monasteries and a number of temples. All schools of Buddhism are represented.
The Buddhist Society, with its headquarters in London, publicises the
principles of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice; it adheres to
no one school of Buddhism.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all the
main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action and
seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian Aid
(which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission; Ecumenical
Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches of England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
Inter-church conversations about the doctrinal and practical issues involved
in the search for unity now take place through international as well as national
210

bodies. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches are represented on some of
these as well as the Anglican and some of the Free Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches also participate in the World
Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches is an associated
national council). This links together some 300 churches in over 100 countries
for co-operation and the study of common problems. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding among members of the two religions
and deals with problems in the social field. The British Council of Churches has
also established a Committee for Relations with People of Other Faiths.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made by
two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
10 National
Economy
ECONOMIC
BACKGROUND
In 1987 the British economy entered its seventh year of sustained growth from
the low point of the recession in May 1981. This represented the longest
upswing since 1945. Investment, export volume and productivity have risen
substantially; inflation has fallen. Although unemployment has been declining
since the middle of 1986, it remains high. However, the number of people in
work and the number of vacancies have both been rising.
Britain has an open economy, in which international trade is a vital part of
economic performance. In 1986 exports of goods and services accounted for
about one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP), one of the highest shares in
the major economies. The proportion has increased over the last two decades
from about 20 per cent in the early 1960s. Similar rises have occurred in most
other developed countries, reflecting the growing importance of international
trade in an increasingly interdependent world economy.
The economy is primarily based on private enterprise, and government policy
is aimed at encouraging and expanding the private sector, which accounts for
three-quarters of GDP and a similar proportion of total employment.
The traditional economic strength of Britain, as a pioneer in the industrial
revolution, has been manufacturing. However, the period since 1945 has seen a
marked rise in living standards and, as in other major developed countries, the
increase that has taken place in real disposable income has led to a faster growth
of demand for services than for manufactures. An adjustment to the relative size
of the manufacturing sector has also resulted from the growth of North Sea oil
output. Services now account for nearly three-fifths of GDP and for two-thirds of
employment, compared with just under half in 1950, while manufacturing
accounts for about a quarter, compared with just over one-third in 1950.
Some 2-8 per cent of Britain’s employed labour force is engaged in
agriculture—a lower proportion than in any other major industrialised country.
However, because of a high level of productivity, Britain is able to produce nearly
two-thirds of its own food.
Britain’s energy position has been transformed in the last decade. With the
discovery and exploitation of oil and natural gas from the Continental Shelf
under the North Sea, the country has become self-sufficient in energy in net
terms. Together, the extraction of oil and gas accounted for 2 to 3 per cent of
GDP in 1986. Coal—traditionally the most important source of energy—still
meets over a third of Britain’s needs.
One of the largest exporters of visible goods, Britain accounts for about 5 per
cent of the world total. It is among the major exporters of aerospace products,
electrical equipment, most types of machinery, chemicals and oil. It is also one of
the world’s largest importers of agricultural products, raw materials and
semi-manufactures.
The broad historical pattern of Britain’s overseas trade has been a deficit on
visible trade offset by a surplus on transactions in invisibles. The significant
contribution made by invisibles to the current account is partly a reflection
of Britain's position as a major financial centre. The banks, insurance

underwriters and brokers, and other financial institutions of the City of London
provide world-wide financial services, and the City contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
The marked rise in living standards in recent years has been accompanied by
the emergence of new industries and the renewal and improvement of much of
the country’s infrastructure. At the same time, in spite of short periods of rapid
economic expansion, the rate of growth has been low in comparison with the
rates in most other industrialised countries, averaging 2 to 3 per cent annually
up to 1973 but only about 1 per cent from then until the recession of the early
1980s. Since then, however, the underlying rate of growth has been some 3 per
cent a year. In 1986 Britain had the highest rate of growth among member
countries of the European Community.
From the late 1960s until about 1980 high rates of inflation reduced Britain’s
competitiveness. Huge rises in the price of oil in 1973-74 and 1979 and
substantial increases in the money supply and public spending were followed by
upsurges in inflation; retail prices rose by 24 per cent in 1975 and by 18 per cent
in 1980. Earnings also grew rapidly; in 1980 the underlying rate of increase was
about 21 per cent. From 1981 inflation declined, reaching an annual rate of 3-4
per cent in 1986. The rate rose a little during 1987, to 4-4 per cent by August.
Since mid-1984 average earnings have been rising at an annual rate of some 7-5
per cent.
In the late 1970s competitiveness suffered from a much more rapid increase in
unit labour costs than in most other industrialised countries, as well as a
marked appreciation in sterling, which rose by 18 per cent between 1978 and
1980. Partly as a result of weakness in the world oil market, sterling then
depreciated: between 1980 and 1984 the value fell by 18 per cent; it steadied in
1985 but resumed its fall in 1986. The decline was partly reversed in the early
part of 1987; by the middle of the year the value of sterling was some 7 per cent
above that at the end of 1986. Sterling depreciation, together with greater
moderation in pay settlements and a substantial rise in productivity since the
end of 1980 (see p 213 ), led to a considerable improvement in competitiveness:
between 1981 and early 1987 Britain’s unit labour costs in manufacturing,
relative to those of its main competitors and adjusted for movements in the
exchange rate, fell by 17 per cent.
In the decade to 1973 output of the manufacturing industries grew at a faster
rate than the economy as a whole. After the oil price rises of 1973—74, however,
and with increasing competition from overseas—from both developed and newly
industrialising countries—manufacturing output fell sharply so that in 1975 it
was 8 per cent lower than two years previously. It then increased from this
trough but, following another oil price rise and stagnation in the world
economy, fell back by over 14 per cent between 1979 and 1981. It has since
averaged an annual rise of a little over 2 per cent but remains below its 1979 level
which, in turn, was below the levels of 1973—74. However, output of the
production industries as a whole (manufacturing, energy and water) had by
1985 risen above its earlier peak of 1979; it continued to grow in 1986. In that
year energy output was more than twice the level of ten years earlier.
Fixed investment grew by about 5 per cent a year during the 1960s but between
1970 and 1983 it held steady apart from cyclical variations. By 1986 it had
reached a record level, one contributory factor having been rising company
profitability. Although, with a falling oil price, profits of oil companies declined
in 1985, profits (net of stock appreciation) of non-oil industrial and commercial

companies were 30 per cent higher than in 1984. A further influence may have
been increased capacity utilisation as Britain recovered from the recession of
1979—81. Over the period 1975 to 1985 there was an increase in the private
sector’s share of total investment (excluding transactions in existing dwellings
and land) from 58 to 79 per cent. Over the same period the share of investment
undertaken by the services sector increased from 40 to 49 per cent while that of
manufacturing fell from 16 to 13 per cent.
Britain has an employed labour force of some 24 million. The number of jobs in
the economy is increasing: between June 1983 and June 1987 the number of
people in work rose by over 1 million; self-employment is at a high level. There
has also been a large growth in the working population; demographic factors
have meant that the number of people reaching working age has exceeded that
reaching retirement age, and there has also been a rise in the number of women
seeking work. As a result, unemployment has remained high. As in other
industrialised countries, this has proved an intractable problem since the early
1970s. From a level of 300,000 to 400,000 in the mid-1960s, unemployment
rose to over 1 million in the mid-1970s (representing around 5 per cent of the
working population) and then increased again very sharply after 1979 to reach 3
million in the early 1980s. The rate of increase then slowed; since mid-1986
unemployment has been falling slightly but still amounts to some 11 per cent of
the working population.
Other labour market indicators have improved. The number of vacancies has
risen; overtime in manufacturing has increased and short-time working has
fallen. The shedding of surplus labour and renewed growth have led to gains in
productivity: between 1980 and 1986 output per head rose by 17 per cent in the
economy as a whole and by 34 per cent in manufacturing alone.
Britain's overseas trade performance fluctuated during the 1970s. In general,
imports of food, energy, raw materials and manufactured goods were greater
than visible exports, which were largely manufactured goods. This deficit on
visible trade was wholly or partly offset by a surplus on invisibles, which cover
earnings from services, together with interest, profits and dividends, and
transfers.
In the years 1980 to 1982 Britain ran surpluses on visible trade. Since then,
however, imports—especially of manufactures—have risen more sharply than
exports and the deficit on visible trade has reappeared. After a long period of
deterioration in the balance of trade in manufactures there was a deficit in
1983—the first since 1945. The deficit continued in the following three years.
Substantial net earnings on invisible trade, however, kept the current account
in surplus up to 1985, while in 1986 it was roughly in balance.
Membership of the European Community has had a major impact on Britain’s
pattern of trade, increasing the proportion with other member countries and
reducing the share of Commonwealth trade. Between 1972 and 1986 the
proportion of Britain’s exports of goods going to other members of the
Community rose from 34 to 48 per cent while that going to other Common¬
wealth countries fell from 19 to 11 per cent. Imports followed a similar trend.
Trade with the newly industrialised countries, including Singapore, Korea,
Taiwan and Malaysia, has risen substantially.
The strength of overseas earnings from invisibles has been maintained by the
continued adaptation to new conditions, particularly following the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979, and growth in world markets of insurance, banking,
tourism, construction, consultancy and other services. In 1986 exports of
services were valued at over one-third of exports of goods; the growth of overseas
assets has resulted in high net receipts of investment income.
214
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The substantial cumulative surplus on current account in the first half of the
1980s implies a corresponding increase in Britain's net external assets, which
are estimated to have risen from £12,000 million at the end of 1979 to about
£114,000 million at the end of 1986—second in size only to those of Japan.
Following the abolition of exchange controls investment outflows, particularly
portfolio investment, increased sharply. There has been an acceleration in the
growth of portfolio investment since 1984, partly a reflection of investment
by banks as they moved into lending in readily marketable forms (such as
floating rate notes) and away from traditional loans. British banks’ sterling
lending abroad has also been at a high level since the abolition of exchange
controls.
Oil The development of North Sea oil and gas production has had a significant effect
on the economy; in 1987 Britain was the world’s fifth largest oil producer. The
benefits to the balance of payments began to appear in the second half of the
1970s; in 1980 Britain had its first surplus on oil trade. In 1974 oil accounted
for some 4 per cent of Britain’s visible exports and 19 per cent of visible imports;
in 1986 the proportions were 11 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. The oil
surplus reached its peak in 1985, at £8,100 million. With the fall in oil prices
(see below) the surplus fell to £4,200 million in 1986. Exports, mainly to other
European Community countries, are equivalent to more than half of domestic
production. They are partly offset in balance of payments terms by imports of
other grades of crude oil from the Middle East and elsewhere.
North Sea oil helped to alleviate the fall in real national income which Britain,
along with other industrialised countries, suffered following the oil price rises of
the 1970s. It has helped to ease the task of controlling public sector borrowing,
contributing to the Government’s counter-inflation strategy. Even after produc¬
tion runs down, the stock of external assets (see above) that has been built up
largely because of North Sea oil will provide a steady flow of income.
The price of oil fell sharply in early 1983 and, after almost three years of virtual
stability, again in late 1985 and the first half of 1986. The price then rose
gradually but by August 1987 was still below its level in late 1985. Although a fall
in the oil price leads to some loss of revenues from oil exports and oil taxation,
consumers and non-oil industry can be expected to benefit.
Sterling As a reflection of Britain’s position as a net oil exporter, sterling has been strong
during periods of high oil prices. Sterling appreciated markedly in 1979 and
1980, with rising oil prices, but, as the oil market weakened, sterling fell back.
The sterling index shows the value of the currency as a weighted average
(1975 = 100) of its exchange rate against other currencies. In July 1987 the
index was 72-8 compared with an average of 96-1 in 1980.
ECONOMIC British governments traditionally sought to influence the rate of growth and the
STRATEGY level of employment by macroeconomic policy measures (for example, by
variations in government expenditure, taxes or controls on consumer credit). At
the same time they attempted to keep inflation down and to achieve approximate
equilibrium in the balance of payments. However, each time the economy
expanded, inflation tended to accelerate and a strong rise in imports typically
gave rise to a balance of payments problem. The effects would finally lead to the
imposition of restraints on home demand. The cyclical pattern of stimulus
followed by restraint became known as ‘stop-go’.
From the late 1960s until about 1980, increases in wage and price levels had
an adverse effect on competitiveness, profitability and business confidence. This
was associated with an increase in unemployment over the period. At various
times governments attempted to control pay rises and (less frequently) price

rises by means of voluntary or statutory controls, but such policies were largely
unsuccessful.
The present Government has adopted economic policies which in many ways
represent a break with those of its predecessors. Macroeconomic (monetary and
fiscal) policies are now directed at bringing down the rate of inflation and
ultimately achieving price stability. Microeconomic policies are aimed at
working with the grain of market forces by encouraging enterprise, efficiency
and flexibility, and so improving the supply side performance of the economy
(see below). Together, these policies are aimed at improving the division of the
increase in money GDP between output growth and inflation, and helping to
create jobs.
The central aim of monetary policy is the creation of conditions that will exert
steady downward pressure on the rate of growth of money GDP, so bringing
down the rate of inflation. Monetary conditions are assessed in the light of
movements in narrow and broad money and the behaviour of other financial
indicators, in particular the exchange rate. There is no mechanical formula for
taking these factors into account; a balance is struck between monetary growth
and the exchange rate consistent with the Government’s inflation objectives.
Narrow money as measured by MO1 has had a stable relationship with money
GDP over a number of years and has proved a reliable indicator of monetary
conditions. A target range of 2 to 6 per cent has been set for MO growth in
1987-88. Changes in broad money have become increasingly difficult to
interpret; far-reaching changes in financial practices have meant that there is
no simple relationship between the growth in broad money and in money GDP.
The Government has therefore decided that there should be no formal target for
broad money in 1987—88.
Monetary policy has been complemented by a firm fiscal policy whose aim has
been a progressive reduction in public borrowing as a proportion of GDP. The
Government is seeking to limit public expenditure as a proportion of GDP. The
figure has been falling since 1982-83 and, by 1989-90, is expected to be back to
the levels of the early 1970s. In the early years of the financial strategy the public
sector borrowing requirement amounted to around 3 per cent of GDP but by
1986-87 this had fallen to 2-25 per cent—the lowest since 1971-72. Further
reductions are envisaged.
While designing macroeconomic policy with the intent of reducing inflation, the
Government has sought to improve the supply response, and hence the
efficiency, of the economy through microeconomic policies. Action has been
taken to expose more of the economy to market forces. Direct controls (for
example, on pay, prices, foreign exchange, dividend payments and commercial
credit) have been abolished, competition in domestic markets strengthened,
labour market reforms introduced, measures taken to encourage share owner¬
ship and a substantial amount of activity transferred from the public to the
private sector by privatisation and by contracting work out. In addition,
regulatory burdens on business have been reduced.
In the labour market the Government has sought to improve work incentives
by reducing personal income tax rates and raising tax thresholds and also by
encouraging the extension of share ownership among employees. A scheme of
income tax relief has been introduced to encourage the spread of profit-related

pay. To improve employment prospects, the Government has also abolished the
National Insurance surcharge (a tax on employed labour) and established a
graduated structure of National Insurance contribution rates which has
reduced the cost to employers of hiring lower-paid workers. The Government has
also taken steps to achieve a better-balanced legal framework for industrial
relations and to improve vocational training. Obstacles to the mobility of labour
have been reduced. For example, the rights of those leaving occupational
pension schemes early have been improved and new arrangements for personal
pensions introduced, both of which will bring down the costs of changing jobs.
The Government has enacted legislation to limit the scope of wages councils.
However, in spite of these measures and although unemployment has remained
at a high level, wages have continued to rise in excess of the inflation rate. This
has taken place despite the Government’s emphasis on the link between pay and
jobs: it has repeatedly warned that, if employment is to rise faster, wages must
rise more slowly.
To improve the working of capital markets, the Government has abolished
controls on foreign exchange transactions, company dividends, hire purchase
and bank lending. Competition among financial institutions is being encour¬
aged within a new statutory framework of investor protection. The Government
has also taken steps to reduce the distorting effects of the tax system on
investment and savings decisions by, among other things, reforming corpora¬
tion tax and the system of capital allowances. Planning restrictions on industrial
investment have been eased, while government support to industry has been
made more selective and, where appropriate, more closely related to job creation.
Particular efforts have been made to improve the flow of investment funds to
small firms and to assist innovation in industry.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for the formulation and conduct of
economic policy, which also involves the Departments of Trade and Industry,
Employment, Energy, the Environment and Transport and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Other bodies are concerned with specific
aspects of economic policy. These include the Bank of England (the central
bank), the National Economic Development Council (in which the Government
meets representatives of management, trade unions and other interests), the
Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and on
the economic problems it faces, the Government makes known its purposes and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests
with the Cabinet.
The value of all goods and services produced in the economy is measured by
GDP. This can be expressed either in terms of market prices (the prices people
pay for the goods and services they buy) or at factor cost (the cost of the goods
and services before adding taxes and subtracting subsidies). It can also be
expressed in current prices or in constant prices (that is, removing the effects of
inflation in order to measure the underlying growth in the economy). In 1986,
GDP at current factor cost totalled £319,000 million.
Gross domestic product is conventionally estimated in three different ways as
the sum total of expenditure, income or output in a given year. Each method
yields the same total in principle, but in practice there are slight differences.
Over the longer term the average of the three is the best indicator of growth in
the economy. The output measure is usually considered the most reliable
measure of short-term movements. In 1986 the index of the average estimate of

GDP at constant factor cost was 113-8 (1980 = 100), compared with 94-5 in

Table 7 gives figures for the expenditure-based measure of GDP, at both current
market prices and current factor cost, and shows how two other main
aggregates used in the national accounts, gross national product and national
income, are derived.

Personal incomes at current prices before tax rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £113,000 million in 1976 to £327,000 million in 1986. Personal
disposable income (that is, personal incomes after deductions—mainly taxation
and National Insurance contributions) was £258,000 million in 1986, 4-3 per

cent higher in real terms than in 1985. Consumers’ expenditure amounted to 72
per cent of pre-tax personal income in 1986 compared with 67 per cent in 1976.
Table 9 shows the pattern of consumers’ expenditure in 1986. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, clothing and footwear, and fuel and power together accounted
for 48 per cent of the total. Consumers’ expenditure increased by 5-8 per cent in
real terms between 1985 and 1986. The changes in the pattern between 1976
and 1986 in Britain were paralleled in other industrialised countries, with
declining proportions spent on food, and on clothing and footwear. Over the
longer term, as incomes rise, people tend to spend increasing proportions on
consumer durables and services—personal, financial and leisure services in
particular.
Saving as a percentage of personal disposable income has fluctuated over the
last decade and in 1986 stood at 91 per cent, down from 14-2 per cent in 1980.
The recent reduction in the saving ratio partly reflects an adjustment to
declining rates of inflation: during periods of rapidly rising prices people need to
increase their rate of saving to maintain the real value of assets fixed in money
terms.
The proportion of total personal income accounted for by income from
employment was 64 per cent in 1986; average gross weekly earnings in April
1986 in Great Britain were £203-40 for full-time male workers and £134-70 for
full-time female workers. The three other main sources of personal income were
self-employment (11 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (9 per
cent) and current grants from general government (15 per cent).
Current expenditure on goods and services by central government and local
authorities amounted to £79,000 million in 1986; it rose by 9 per cent in real
terms over the period 1976 to 1986. The main cause of this was the growth over
the period in the social services, especially education and health.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of

11 Framework
of Industry
Among the most prominent trends in industrial activity in Britain during the
last ten years have been the growth of the offshore oil and gas industries
together with related products and services; the rapid development of electronic
and microelectronic technologies and their application to a wide range of other
sectors; and a continuous rise in the service industries’ share of total
employment. Industrial output has risen steadily since the recession of
1980-81, which, as in other market economies, was largely brought about by a
rise in world oil prices. In early 1987 total output was 19 per cent higher than at
its trough in early 1981. It was only during 1985, however, that production
regained the level of mid-1979, which had been the high point of a period of
growth since 1976. A marked increase in productivity has been a major feature
of recovery. Manufacturing productivity has grown by 30 per cent since 1979,
the highest increase among the major industrial countries. Gains in produc¬
tivity, however, meant that this increased output was produced with fewer
workers. Consequently, employment, though increasing, was still lower than in
1981. Table 11 shows gross domestic product (GDP) by sector and the
percentage of total GDP and of total employment in each sector in 1986.

Government policies are designed to help British industry become more
competitive and responsive to market forces, both in Britain and overseas (see
p 229), and also to encourage development in advanced technologies. These
objectives are also borne in mind by the Government when participating in the
formulation of European Community industrial policies.
This chapter outlines recent industrial performance and describes some of the
general features of industrial organisation in Britain, such as the forms of
enterprise, methods of financing and industrial association. It looks at factors
affecting productivity and competitiveness, including investment, technological

advance, research and development, and management and workforce training,
as well as means of improving standards of design and quality assurance. It also
outlines the framework of incentives for general industrial development
provided by the Government, and by Community institutions, and the
regulatory framework within which industry operates.
The forms of industrial organisation and the patterns of ownership and control
are varied. The main categories of organisation are: unincorporated businesses
(sole traders and partnerships) of which there are at least 1 million; incor¬
porated companies; and public sector enterprises, which are owned by the
Government (see p 231). Incorporation means that companies are entered on an
official register of companies (see p 241); at the end of 1985 there were over
1 million companies on the registers, though a proportion of these were not
actively trading. About 5,000 of these companies were public limited companies.
There are about 13 major public sector enterprises with an employed labour
force of 1-2 million. The Government is pursuing a programme of‘privatisation’
whereby some of these enterprises are transformed into incorporated companies
and their shares sold to the public (see p 232). Employees in such companies are
being given a preferential right to buy shares in their new companies and
employee share ownership in general has been facilitated by changes in
legislation, thus enabling employees to have a financial interest in the
profitability of their companies. Although not numerous, co-operative enter¬
prises (which are also incorporated companies) increased in number from 300
in 1979 to about 1,500 in mid-1986. There has also been a rise in the number of
‘buy-outs’ in which the staff, or management, of a company raises the finance to
purchase it. In the period from 1979 to mid-1986 there were more than 1,200,
with a total value of nearly £3,000 million.
In some sectors a small number of large companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a large proportion of total production notably in the vehicle,
shipbuilding, aerospace and transport equipment industries. However, it is rare
for a few shareholders to have a controlling interest since shares in these
companies are usually distributed among many holders or held by insurance
companies or pension funds representing a cross-section of the community.
Private enterprises account for about 73 per cent of GDP in Britain and for the
greater part of activity in the agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and miscellaneous service sectors. There is substantial
public ownership in the energy, transport and communications sectors,
though, with privatisation (see p 232), this has declined. Unincorporated
businesses, corporate enterprises and public sector enterprises contribute
about 21,52 and 8 per cent of GDP respectively (the remainder being accounted
for by central and local government).
About 100 companies registered in Britain each had capital employed of over
£500 million in 1985. In terms of annual sales four of the top 20 industrial
groups in Europe were British, with British Petroleum second. Shell Transport
and Trading third, BAT Industries eighteenth and Imperial Chemical Industries
twentieth.
Over half of companies’ funds for further investment and other purposes are
internally generated. Banks provide the chief external source of finance, but
companies have increasingly turned to equity finance in the mid-1980s. The
main forms of short-term finance available in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit and factoring (making cash available to a company in
exchange for its debts). Types of medium- and long-term finance include bank
loans, the mortgaging of property and the issue of securities and shares to the
public through the Stock Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also be

regarded as a form of finance. Other sources of finance for industry include the
Government (see p 232), the European Community and specialist financial
institutions.
The 1980s have been particularly notable for the growth of venture capital
schemes run by financial institutions in both the public and private sectors to
provide ‘start-up' and development finance for small and new firms. The
establishment of two new securities markets under the auspices of the Stock
Exchange and over-the-counter markets outside the Exchange has enabled
fast-developing young companies to raise capital through share issues, even
though they are not eligible for a full Stock Exchange listing.
There are several types of voluntary association representing private enterprises
and covering, with varying degrees of completeness, most of British industry.
The central body representing British business and industry is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). The CBI directly represents about 10,500 parent
and subsidiary companies, as well as the members of some 200 trade
associations and the majority of public sector enterprises. For its members, it
acts as an advisory and consultative body, providing them with information and
statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally
to the Government and public as well as internationally. CBI representatives sit
on such bodies as the National Economic Development Council, the Manpower
Services Commission and the Health and Safety Commission.
Chambers of commerce are open to producers and traders of all kinds and are
organised on a geographical basis. They exist to provide export assistance as
well as advisory and information services and training courses. There are 88
local chambers of commerce, representing 60,000 firms, affiliated to regional
associations and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Additional
central organisations serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Trade associations consist of companies producing or retailing a particular
product or group of products. There are estimated to be over 1,500 such
associations. They exist to provide common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to government departments. Employers’ organisa¬
tions are usually concerned with the negotiation of wages and conditions of
work in a particular industrial sector, although sometimes one institution may
combine this function with that of a trade association. The Department of
Employment lists 150 major employers’ associations.
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations for
particular regions or areas and the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
in Scotland.
British companies have had a relatively low rate of profitability historically,
although there was an improvement between 1981 and 1985. For all industrial
and commercial companies the rate rose to about 12 per cent in 1985, the
highest level for over 20 years. Manufacturing profitability rose to 7 per cent, the
highest rate since 1973.
Although output per head in Britain has in the past been low by international
standards, it has risen sharply since 1981 and in recent years the growth has
been among the highest in the major industrialised nations. The rise for
manufacturing has been greater than for the economy as a whole. The index for
the whole economy in 1986 was 116-6 (1980 = 100). Table 12 shows the output
and employment indices for 1985 and 1986. There was a fall in employment in
production industries between these years, but this was more than offset
by a rise in employment in service industries, which led to an overall increase.
Output and output per head in both production and service industries rose

between 1985 and 1986. The Government believes that the increased competi¬
tiveness resulting from these productivity gains will lead to a sustained rise in
living standards and a rise in employment.
Among the factors affecting productivity are capital investment, innovations
and improvements in products and processes, and the performance and
training of management and labour. The following sections outline trends and
developments in these areas.

aExcluding self-employment.
Investment by the manufacturing, construction, distribution and financial
services industries grew by 9 per cent in real terms in 1985 and reached a record
level, 33 per cent higher than in 1981. It fell back a little in 1986 but is forecast
to grow again in 1987. Investment in major sectors of the economy in 1986 (at
1980 prices) is shown in Table 13. The figures for manufacturing industry do
not include expenditure on leased assets since these are attributed to the service
industries on the basis of ownership. Manufacturing industry is, however, the
major user of leased assets. The practice of leasing has grown rapidly since the
early 1970s but is likely to decline marginally owing to changes made in the tax
treatment of capital investment in the 1984 Budget (see p 230).
Britain was a pioneer in both computing and telecommunications. It is among
the world’s leading nations in the production and use of micro- and minicompu¬
ters as well as in the provision of computing services and systems. Between 1981
and 1986 the number of British firms utilising microelectronic devices doubled;
in firms with more than 500 employees more than 90 per cent were so equipped
at the end of 1986. Computerised control is widely used in steel mills,
coal-mines, oil refineries and chemical and engineering plants. Nearly twice as
many robots were installed in British factories in 1986 as two years earlier.
Greater use of robotics and of other new technologies such as fibre optics and
optoelectronics is encouraged by various Department of Trade and Industry
schemes.

The use of personal computers in offices is now common, and advanced data
transmission systems and databases are being developed. New technology is also
being used in the area of personal banking and sales as electronic funds transfer
at point of sale (EFTPOS) equipment begins to be installed in addition to the
automated teller machines which are now widespread. In the financial
institutions of the City of London computerised information is now fun¬
damental to the working of many of the markets and in the Stock Exchange
computers have become integral to the dealing and regulatory systems.
British firms are also advanced in the forefront of technical innovation in the
aerospace industry, especially in the application of electronics. In the pharma¬
ceuticals sector, four of the five best-selling drugs in the world in 1985 were
discovered in British laboratories. In the field of medical technology British
companies and hospitals have been among the leaders in applying techniques
such as magnetic resonance imaging and laser surgery. Biotechnology has
gained a new impetus from research achievements in genetic engineering and
cell fusion. The Department of Trade and Industry and other government bodies
are encouraging the exploitation of new developments. A Biotechnology Unit at
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist is the focus for government
co-operation with industry.
The British Technology Group (BTG) promotes the industrial application of
developments of all kinds made in public sector research institutions and
universities (see p 233). Some of the major technical achievements which it has
exploited or supported are cephalosporin antibiotics, pyrethroid insecticides,
glass-reinforced cement, carbon fibres and advanced integrated circuits.
Industrial expenditure on research and development in 1985 was £5,146
million, of which £1,193 million came from government sources, £575 million
from overseas and £3,377 million from other sources (mostly from private
sector companies themselves). The main areas of expenditure were electronics
(£1,738 million), chemicals and allied products (£941 million), aerospace (£845

million), mechanical engineering (£269 million), and motor vehicles
(£372 million).
Estimated outturn figures for government-funded research and development
in 1985-86 include: Ministry of Defence, £2,388 million; Department of Trade
and Industry, £367 million; Science and Engineering Research Council, £285
million; Department of Energy and United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority,
£224 million; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, £122 million;
Agricultural and Food Research Council, £48 million; Medical Research Council,
£122 million; Natural Environment Research Council, £65 million; and
Department of Transport, £25 million.
The Government has sponsored a major programme in advanced information
technology, known as the Alvey programme, which comprises research projects
involving collaboration between industry, academic institutions and other
research organisations. The programme runs over the years 1983-88 with a
total budget of £350 million, over half of which is being provided by the
Government. The four main areas of research are software engineering,
man-machine interfaces, very large-scale integrated circuits and intelligent
knowledge-based systems. By June 1986, 95 per cent of the funds had been
committed to 187 projects involving industrial firms and universities and 116
collaborative schemes with no direct industrial participation. Altogether, 108
firms, 53 universities, 11 polytechnics and at least 20 research establishments
are involved in the programme. The European Community’s research pro¬
gramme into the development and application of information technologies, the
European Strategic Programme of Research into Information Technology
(ESPRIT), has a budget of 1,500 million ECUs1 (£1,030 million) for the five years
1984—89, of which 50 per cent will be provided by the Community. British
companies are participating in 179 of the 219 projects.
The BRITE programme (Basic Research in Industrial Technology) is a
Community project designed to encourage collaborative research into applica¬
tions of advanced technology in some of the more traditional industries. Nearly
100 British firms and educational and research organisations are involved in 51
of BRITE’s 99 projects. It has a budget of 125 million ECUs (£85 million) over the
four years 1985—88.
The European Community’s Research in Advanced Communications for
Europe Scheme (RACE) aims to lay the groundwork for broadband optical fibre
communications systems. Britain was represented in 26 of the 32 collaborative
research and development projects in RACE’S first phase in 1986.
British companies are participating in 40 of the 108 projects in the Eureka
programme, which aims to encourage European co-operation in the develop¬
ment and production of high technology products with global sales potential,
and which has the support of 18 European governments and the European
Commission.
Management education is provided by all the polytechnics and many colleges of
further education, while Regional Management Centres have been established
in England and Wales by associations of some of these colleges, with some
similar organisations in Scotland. Universities make an important contribu¬
tion, especially through the full-time postgraduate programmes at business
schools such as those of London, Manchester, City, Durham and Strathclyde
universities. Training courses for managers are offered by several independent
colleges, including the Management College (Henley-on-Thames), Ashridge
College (Berkhamsted) and the Cranfield School of Management (Bedford). Open

Training
and distance learning opportunities are becoming more widely available. The
British Institute of Management, which aims to encourage excellence in
management, has a particular interest in management training. There are a
number of other professional bodies concerned with standards and training in
specialised branches of management.
The Engineering Council was established under Royal Charter in 1981. Its
objectives are to promote the science and practice of engineering and to advance
education in engineering. The Council maintains a register of 300,000
chartered engineers, technician engineers and engineering technicians. In
co-operation with the various professional institutions and other organisations
concerned with training in engineering, it has set standards for education,
training and experience, and accredited courses by which people qualify for
registration. The council is advised by 170 industrial affiliates, who are em¬
ployers of engineers, on industrial requirements for engineers and technicians.
A well-trained workforce is essential for economic growth, and recent technolo¬
gical advances have created a need for an even greater quantity, range and
quality of technical and vocational training, both for young people and for
adults. The main responsibility for training rests with employers and indi¬
viduals. The Business & Technician Education Council (BTEC), a privately
funded body, deals with the education and training of technicians and their
equivalents in the professions and commerce, by designing syllabuses and
validating courses offered at colleges of further education and elsewhere in
England and Wales; its Scottish counterpart is the Scottish Vocational
Education Council. The BTEC is working with the Engineering Council and the
Engineering Industry Training Board to co-ordinate their systems of assessing
and certifying the skills of those receiving technician education and training,
and with the City and Guilds of London Institute to develop the pre-vocational
courses of the two organisations into a more coherent and comprehensive
system. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications (NCVQ) was set up as
a limited company by the Government in 1986 to design and implement a new
national framework for vocational qualifications with agreed standards of
occupational competence. Working with and through the established examining
and awarding bodies, the NCVQ will give accreditation to various qualifications,
which will carry an insignia to show this. Initially a framework with four defined
levels of occupational competence will be operated.
The Government is increasing its responsibility for some aspects of training.
It is estimated to have spent some £450 million on this in 1979—80, rising to
over £1,500 million in 1986—87. The Manpower Services Commission (MSC),
which consists of representatives of employers, unions and local authority and
educational interests, is the main agency through which the Government
institutes action and monitors progress in training. Its main scheme is the
Youth Training Scheme, which offers a course of planned work experience
integrated with off-the-job training for unemployed 16- or 17-year-old school-
leavers. The scheme provides two years of training for 16-year-olds and one year
for 17-year-olds, leading to a recognised qualification. The Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative aims at providing four-year courses with a
strong technical and vocational element in schools and colleges for 14- to
18-year-olds. Following successful pilot projects this will be expanded into a
national scheme from the autumn of 1987.
The Department of Education and Science announced plans in 1986 to set up
technology colleges in urban areas to provide a broadly based secondary
education with a strong technological element.
The aim of the Government's adult training strategy is to encourage employers
228
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Design
Quality and
Standards
and others to give adult training a high priority and to secure an adequate
supply of people with up-to-date skills. The MSC’s adult training schemes are
grouped into two main programmes—the Wider Opportunities Training Pro¬
gramme, a broad-based series of schemes aimed at enhancing unemployed
people's employability, and a Job-Related Programme which aims to enhance
the skills of both employed and unemployed people, including the Job Training
Scheme, which trains unemployed people in skills for which there is a known
local labour demand. The MSC is also encouraging the use of open learning
methods (using video and tapes) on all training courses, and is establishing the
Open College which, beginning in September 1987, will broadcast vocational
courses below degree level. In 1986—87 the MSC's adult training schemes helped
about 420,000 people.
Education departments’ PICKUP schemes, which include updating training
for adults working with new technology, are to be expanded in 1987—88, and a
national network of New Technology Centres is to be set up in partnership with
the industry departments and the MSC.
The Open University, which provides degree courses using distance learning
techniques, notably television broadcasts, has set up the Open University
Business School, which offers part-time courses leading to a diploma in
management. The School, which is strongly supported by the British Institute of
Management, has been used by over 2,000 companies and organisations since it
opened in 1983. Managers continue to work while studying, which is of
particular use to those small companies which cannot afford to release staff on a
full-time basis.
‘Industry Year 1986’, launched by the Royal Society of Arts with the aim of
changing attitudes to industry, is continuing under the title ‘Industry Matters'.
The campaign, which the Government strongly supports, has been particularly
successful in establishing links between companies and schools.
Good design is seen as crucial for maintaining and improving the quality and
competitiveness of goods and services; the Department of Trade and Industry
gives priority to its campaign to encourage greater awareness in industry and
commerce (among both producers and customers) of the value of good design. It
organises conferences to underline the importance of design and has taken
steps to include design education in the school system and widen awareness of
design in business schools. Advice and assistance on design matters are
available from the government-sponsored Design Council. The Design Council
has centres in London, Cardiff and Glasgow, and its operations include giving
advice on design problems; the organisation of product displays at overseas
trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design; providing help for design
education; and the production of a range of publications. A funded consultancy
scheme, operated by the Design Council on behalf of the Government, offers
firms employing up to 500 people a maximum of 15 working days’ consultancy
at subsidised rates. The Council provides annual awards for consumer and
contract goods, engineering products and components, computer software,
medical equipment, and motor vehicles and accessories. The Society of
Chartered Designers is the representative professional body in Great Britain of
industrial designers.
An important aim of government policy is to encourage industry and commerce
to recognise the importance of quality and of the use of standards. The objective
is to enhance the quality of British goods and services by encouraging an
integrated approach to quality at all stages of design, production, marketing and
delivery to customers. The National Quality Campaign, launched in 1983, aims
at increasing the competitiveness of British industry. Through the Business

AND
INDUSTRY
and Technical Advisory Service (see p 236) the Government is helping small and
medium-sized firms to learn about and apply quality-management techniques
based on a national standard. To increase customer confidence, companies are
being encouraged to obtain certification to the national standard. The National
Accreditation Council for Certification bodies was set up to assess and officially
approve the competence and performance of organisations undertaking such
certification.
The British Standards Institution (BSD, a voluntary body which is responsible
for standards-making nationally, works with industry and government to
produce standards which are of the required quality, relevant to the needs of the
market, internationally respected, and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. With government support, the BSI has become increas¬
ingly involved in international standards-making; the new approach under the
European Standards Initiative will contribute to the aim of creating a single
internal market in the European Community by 1992. About a quarter of the
10,000 British Standards are now identical with international standards. In
1987, Resource, a joint venture by the BSI and the Government, was launched to
promote collaboration with overseas countries in standards, quality assurance,
metrology and testing.
The National Physical Laboratory (NPL), a research establishment of the
Department of Trade and Industry, is responsible for providing the measure¬
ment standards and calibration facilities necessary to ensure that measure¬
ments in Britain are made on a common basis and to the required accuracy. It
maintains links with national standards laboratories all over the world to ensure
international compatibility in measurements essential for overseas trade and
technological co-operation. Based within the NPL, the National Measurement
Accreditation Service (NAMAS) provides a focal point for the voluntary accredita¬
tion of calibration and testing facilities in Britain. It forms a link between the
national standards maintained by the NPL and accredited measurement
laboratories, including those servicing manufacturers and other producers,
contractors, regulating bodies, quality assessment and product certification
schemes, the Government, the health service and consumer bodies. NAMAS
accredited laboratories offer calibration of scientific instruments and provide
official certificates for electrical, mechanical, flow, optical, pressure, thermal
and time measurements. Another NPL function is to carry out research in
scientific and technological areas of national importance, such as engineering
materials and information technology. The aim is to stimulate the exploitation
of such technologies by British industry and to provide information for
incorporation in new specification standards.
The National Weights and Measures Laboratory, also part of the Department of
Trade and Industry, is responsible for administering the Weights and Measures
Act 1985, which is largely concerned with standards and measuring equipment
for use in trade. In 1984 the Government appointed a committee to review the
metrological control of weighing and measuring equipment for commercial use
taking account of the impact of modern technology and trading conditions; the
Government has accepted many of its recommendations, including the intro¬
duction of a ‘self-verification' scheme for approved manufacturers.
The Department of Trade and Industry is the department chiefly responsible for
relations between the Government and industry. It is responsible for oversight of
certain nationalised industries, for industrial science, technology and research,
for industrial policy and assistance, for overseas trade and export promotion, for
competition policy and consumer affairs, for company legislation and for the
230

Patent Office. In support of these activities it collects comprehensive statistics
through the Business Statistics Office.
The aim of the Government's industrial policy is to increase the national
production of wealth and promote and enhance the vitality and competitiveness
of British trade and industry, within a proper regulatory framework. The heart
of the policy is the control of inflation as the basis for sustained economic
growth and the creation of a social and economic climate conducive to enterprise
and initiative. To this end the Government is reducing the extent of state
ownership, and industrial investment agencies in the public sector have been
encouraged to secure private sector participation in their projects. Competition
policy has been strengthened and other measures have been introduced to
promote efficiency and competitiveness, including campaigns to enhance
standards and quality assurance, to lay greater emphasis on training and skills,
to increase links between industry and education and to remove unnecessary
controls on companies. An Enterprise and Deregulation Unit has been set up
within the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Government is also
encouraging the development of small businesses by reducing their administra¬
tive burdens, adjusting taxation and other policies.
Successive governments have aimed to provide an environment favourable to
industrial expansion. In the case of industrial plant and machinery there is an
annual allowance against profits for tax purposes of 25 per cent (on a reducing
balance basis) beginning in the year in which expenditure occurs. There is an
allowance for investment in industrial property of 4 per cent a year (on a
straight-line basis). Special arrangements exist for short life (usually high
technology) assets. There is a 100 per cent allowance for scientific research.
Progressive reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have been brought
into effect as a result of the 1984 Budget.
The Department of Trade and Industry's schemes of assistance to industry
and commerce are grouped under four headings: support for innovation;
support for national and regional investment: business and technical advisory
services; and support for exports. The Department's total spending (over £1,250
million in 1986—87) is to be reduced over the years up to 1989—90, mainly
through cuts in support for nationalised industries and in regional and general
industrial support. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices also
provide elements of industrial support. Various other government departments
or agencies in the public sector provide aid, either for defined activities (such as
agriculture, energy production, transport and tourism) or for specific geo¬
graphical areas. The latter include inner urban areas, for which the Government
has schemes of social and economic regeneration; enterprise zones—areas in
which, as an experiment, economic activity is relieved of certain tax burdens
and administrative controls; and freeports (also experimental) in which traders
are freed from certain customs requirements. This national industrial assist¬
ance is supplemented by assistance from European Community funds (see
p 237). Direct investment from overseas is encouraged, overseas firms generally
being offered the same facilities and incentives as British-based companies.
The Department of Trade and Industry’s Invest in Britain Bureau provides
foreign companies with advice and assistance on all aspects of locating and
relocating businesses in Britain, and on expanding existing facilities. The
Bureau reported 322 new inward investment projects in 1986. Britain has for
many years been the leading country for United States manufacturing invest¬
ment in Europe and at the end of 1985 total US investment in Britain was valued
at $US 34,000 million (about £23,500 million), representing over 40 per cent of
total US investment in the European Community. Britain has attracted around
thirty per cent of all Japanese investment in the European Community since

1951 and total direct Japanese investment has reached an estimated
$US 3,200 million.
Recognition of outstanding industrial performance is conferred annually by The
Queen’s Awards for Export and Technology. The Queen’s Awards are granted on
the recommendations of a committee, which includes senior representatives
from industry, commerce, the trade unions and government departments. All
firms incorporated in Britain are eligible to apply, regardless of size and the
products or services they provide. Other awards include the Export Awards for
Smaller Manufacturers (for firms employing fewer than 200 people) and the
MacRobert Award, the major award for engineering in Britain (made by the
Fellowship of Engineering for successful technological innovation).
The major nationalised industries are: the electricity supply industry (including
the Central Electricity Generating Board and 12 area electricity boards in
England and Wales); the ten regional water authorities; British Coal; the British
Steel Corporation; British Rail; and the Post Office. In total the industries
account for around 5-7 per cent of GDP and employ about 3-8 per cent of all
employees.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not civil
servants although they are responsible to ministers who appoint the chairman
and members of each board. Ministers are responsible for agreeing with the
industries their general strategies and have the power to give general directions
as to how the industry should be run, but do not interfere in day-to-day
management. The Government’s policy is to encourage the nationalised
industries to behave as far as possible as commercial enterprises, and this is
carried out through the financial framework, set by the Government, within
which the industries are expected to operate. This is designed also to integrate
the industries’ medium-term commercial aims with the requirements of
government policy on the management of the economy. The main elements of
the framework are: clear government objectives for the industries; regular
corporate plans and performance reviews; systematic monitoring; agreed
principles relating to investment appraisal and pricing; external financing
limits; and financial targets and performance aims.
To ensure that nationalised industry investment earns an adequate economic
return, there is a ‘required rate of return’ which investment programmes are
expected to achieve. The current rate is 5 per cent in real terms before tax.
Financial targets are set for individual nationalised industries to give them a
framework similar to those of private sector companies which need to earn
profits. They are supported by a series of performance aims, covering costs and
standards of service, which are considered particularly important for industries
with some monopoly power where financial targets would not automatically
impose pressures for operating efficiency. External financing limits, which
control the amount of finance (grants and borrowing) that a nationalised
industry can raise from external sources in any financial year, are an important
short-term operating control. They are set in the light of a nationalised
industry’s financial target and its expected performance and investment
requirements. Nationalised industries are planning to finance a greater
proportion of investment from internally generated funds.
External scrutiny of nationalised industry efficiency is conducted by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (see p 238), which carries out a number of
investigations each year at the instigation of ministers. Where appropriate,
investigations may also be undertaken by management consultants. National¬
ised industry matters are also considered by parliamentary committees such as
the Treasury and Civil Service Committee and the Public Accounts Committee.

Privatisation
Support for
Innovation
The Government believes that reform of the nationalised industries is essential
to economic recovery, and that the best way to improve performance in the long
term is to expose the industries to market forces, through privatisation and the
promotion of competition. Privatisation also provides a major opportunity for
the Government to pursue its policy of widening share ownership, encouraging
both employees and the general public to take a direct stake in British industry.
Since 1979 the Government has mounted 16 major public offers of shares, with
net proceeds of some £17,500 million, and this has led to a substantial increase
in the proportion of shareholders (estimated at 19-5 per cent in mid-1987
compared with 7 per cent in 1979). Businesses which have been privatised
include British Aerospace, British Airways, British Gas, British Telecom, Cable
and Wireless, the National Freight Consortium, Amersham International,
Jaguar, Enterprise Oil, Britoil, Associated British Ports, Rolls-Royce, BAA
(formerly the British Airports Authority), a number of subsidiaries of the
National Bus Company and British Shipbuilders' warship-building yards. Many
other state enterprises have also been sold and about 655,000 jobs have been
transferred to the private sector. Planned privatisations include the remaining
subsidiaries of the National Bus Company and a number of water supply
authorities. To stimulate efficiency, the Government has relaxed the statutory
monopolies of a number of nationalised industries.
Expenditure on research and development supported by the Department of
Trade and Industry is aimed at encouraging firms to undertake innovations
which promise high returns and to increase their investment in research and
development, and at securing more effective exploitation of national and
international advances. Emphasis is given to key technologies and collabora¬
tive work. Projects receiving support are being carried out increasingly in
collaboration with higher education; other work is done at research
associations and in government research establishments. The Department’s
research establishments are the National Physical Laboratory (responsible not
only for measurement standards, but also for research and development in
related fields of national importance, including the properties of industrially
important materials, and information technology), the National Engineering
Laboratory (research and development in mechanical engineering, including
manufacturing systems and robotics, materials applications, fluid power,
pumps, fans and heat exchangers, and structural analysis and testing), the
Warren Spring Laboratory (control engineering, materials handling, metal
extraction, mineral processing, waste materials processing and environmental
technology), and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (analytical services
mainly to central and local government, public institutions and international
organisations).
‘Support for Innovation’ is the Department of Trade and Industry’s general
facility for providing selective financial support for research and development
projects leading to new products and processes and for longer-term applied
research projects. In 1986—87 the Department is estimated to have spent some
£390 million on scientific and technological assistance (project support,
advisory services, awareness programmes, high technology investment
schemes, aerospace, and research establishments). The Department is advised
by a Technology Requirements Board and a number of advisory committees of
senior industrialists and academics on the overall allocation of its resources to
particular technologies and industrial sectors.
The Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development, whose mem¬
bership includes academics, industrialists and trade unionists engaged in all
aspects of research and development in a wide variety of industrial sectors, is a
source of independent advice to ministers collectively on applied research and

development in both the public and private sectors, on the linkage between this
research and scientific research supported by government departments, on the
development and application of technology, and on the role of Britain in
international collaboration in such activities. The Council has published a
number of reports on various technologies and the exploitation of scientific
developments. It is served by a secretariat in the Cabinet Office.
The objective of the British Technology Group (BTG) is to promote the
development of new technology into commercial products, particularly where
the technology originates from public sector sources, such as universities,
polytechnics, research councils and government research establishments. It
offers to take responsibility for protecting and licensing inventions from these
sources, provides funds for development, seeks licensees and negotiates licence
agreements with industry. As part of its technology transfer role it can also offer
companies up to 50 per cent of the cost of developing new products and
processes based on new technology. The BTG approaches transactions on a
commercial basis and expects to recover its investment by means of a percentage
levy on sales of the resulting product or process.
The BTG currently has a portfolio of 1,715 British patents and patent
applications, over 600 licensees in Britain and overseas, 427 development
projects at universities and other public sector institutions, and 237 projects
with industrial companies. Its licensing activities provide more than 80 per cent
of its income.
In cases where a particular technology requires the setting up of a new
company, the BTG can perform a catalytic role in launching start-up companies.
In 1986-87, the industry departments in Great Britain spent £46 million on
national selective assistance, £513 million on regional development grant and
£123 million on regional selective assistance.
The Department provides investment support for major projects which are
judged to have exceptional national benefits and which would not proceed
without assistance. The Department also operates schemes of selective assist¬
ance to support investment in microelectronics, fibre optics and optoelectronics
and advanced manufacturing technology.
Guarantees are provided for the repayment of loans and interest incurred in
the purchase of new ships and mobile offshore installations built in Britain.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years, in certain regions, of older industries, such as
coal, steel, shipbuilding and textiles, and partly to the tendency of many newer
and expanding industries to develop elsewhere. Thus the traditional industrial
areas, mainly in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the north of England,
have experienced, for many years, higher unemployment rates than regions
such as the South East, and have suffered from net outward migration and
industrial dereliction. In order to help to restore the economies of the areas of
greatest need the Government has provided incentives to encourage industrial
development in designated ‘assisted areas’. Following a review of policy in Great
Britain (Northern Ireland is treated separately), the Government has reaffirmed
. its commitment to maintain an effective regional industrial policy to ease the
process of change in areas which have been dependent on declining industries
and encourage the setting up of new businesses there. A new structure of
regional industrial incentives, more directly linked to job creation, and a revised
designation of the assisted areas, were introduced in 1984.

There are two categories of assisted areas: ‘development areas’ and ‘inter¬
mediate areas’, with the former being adjudged to have the greatest need for
assistance (see map, opposite). Regional development grants are payable for
investment in qualifying activities in the development areas, either as a
proportion of capital expenditure limited by a cost-per-job ceiling or as an
amount for each new job created, whichever is the more advantageous to the
investor. Small firms are not, in general, subject to a cost-per-job ceiling. Nearly
all manufacturing industries and some service industries are eligible for
regional development grants. In addition, regional selective assistance may be
payable to manufacturing and certain service sector projects that create or
safeguard employment throughout the assisted areas.
The Government provides factories and workshops where the private sector is
unwilling to invest in them. Special grants are available towards the improve¬
ment of the infrastructure in the assisted areas and towards the clearance of
derelict land.
The Department of Trade and Industry takes the lead in the formulation of
regional industrial policy and administers the regional development grant and
regional selective assistance schemes in England. The Welsh and Scottish
Offices administer these schemes in their respective countries. Factories in the
assisted areas are provided, often in association with the private sector, by the
government-funded English Industrial Estates Corporation (known as English
Estates), and by the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.
The Industrial Development Board, formed in 1982 under the aegis of the
Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, offers a range of
incentives similar to those available in the assisted areas (in some cases at
higher rates). Incentives automatically available to manufacturing industry
include grants of up to 20 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, training
grants, grants for key workers moving to Northern Ireland and exemption from
local authority rates (local property taxes) for manufacturing premises. Manu¬
facturing and service industry projects which create jobs may be eligible for
grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new fixed assets, interest relief grants,
favourable rental terms for factories, and grants to assist with setting-up costs
and research and development costs. The Board can also provide equity and loan
capital for new and expanding businesses, assist the development of new
high-technology products and processes, and promote joint ventures with
overseas companies. Other incentives include corporation tax relief of up to 80
per cent for certain new projects; 30 per cent grants for approved energy
conservation projects; grants to attract and retain good management; and an
advisory service on production methods.
Government regional policies have been aimed at encouraging new industries in
order to offset the decline in traditional activities. Accordingly the Scottish and
Welsh Development Agencies promote industrial development in their respective
countries. They encourage investment by overseas companies, provide equity
and loan capital for industrial projects (which they are expected to do with a
maximum of private sector participation), provide government factories, and
have powers to assist small firms and undertake land reclamation.
The Development Commission is responsible for promoting the economic and
social development of rural England. It provides small factories and workshops
which are built and managed by English Estates, and administers a grant
scheme for the conversion of redundant buildings to industrial or commercial
premises. The Commission's main agency, the Council for Small Industries in
Rural Areas, provides technical, management and financial advice, training

facilities and loans to small businesses from 31 county offices. The Commission
also supports voluntary bodies in rural areas to encourage community activity
and self help and provides finance for small-scale rural housing and transport
schemes. Though its responsibility extends over the whole of rural England, the
Commission’s resources are concentrated in the areas of greatest need, which
are designated as rural development areas.
In Scotland and Wales similar services are provided generally through the
development agencies, but separate bodies cater for two particular rural areas.
In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board provides loans and
grants for viable projects in manufacturing, agriculture, fisheries and services,
makes available training grants and advice, and builds factories. The Develop¬
ment Board for Rural Wales (usually referred to as ‘Mid-Wales Development')
provides factories, key worker housing and advice for small businesses. It has a
general responsibility to promote the economic and social well-being of
mid-Wales and a particular responsibility for the new town of Newtown, Powys.
Business and technical advisory services include consultancy grants for firms
employing up to 500 people which wish to improve the quality, design or
strategic marketing of their products. Grants are also available to all manufac¬
turing firms and in some cases to service companies, towards the cost of
feasibility studies by consultants into the exploitation of biotechnology,
microelectronics applications, advanced manufacturing systems (computer-
aided design and manufacture, robotics, flexible manufacturing systems or
computer-aided production management) and the use of integrated circuits.
The Department of Employment is responsible for the formation of policy
towards the small business sector. Together with the Small Business Division of
the Scottish Development Agency and the Business Development Unit of the
Welsh Development Agency, the Department’s Small Firms Service provides
advice and guidance on a wide range of business problems affecting small firms
(in manufacturing, generally defined as those firms employing less than 200
people) and those seeking to set up businesses. In Northern Ireland the Local
Enterprise Development Unit, established to promote the development of small
industries, provides grants, loans, help with obtaining premises and manage¬
ment advice to new and expanding companies.
The Government has been particularly concerned since the late 1970s to
encourage small firms, and between 1983 and 1985 the number of new
businesses starting up exceeded the number of those ceasing to trade by about
550 a week. It has introduced a framework of measures aimed at reducing
burdens and providing incentives for enterprise and risk-taking. These have
included a loan guarantee scheme, under which the Government guarantees
repayment of 70 per cent of medium-term loans made by participating financial
institutions; a business expansion scheme, under which tax reliefs are available
to private individuals investing in small businesses; the enterprise allowance
scheme, which enables longer-term unemployed people to claim an allowance
while establishing a new business; business improvement services for small
firms in areas affected by job losses in steel, shipbuilding, textiles, deep-sea
fisheries and tin-mining; and business and technical advisory services offering
subsidised consultancy on design, quality assurance and marketing to small
and medium-sized firms. A range of other tax concessions has also been made
for small firms. The development of new sources of venture capital has been
promoted and a number of private sector initiatives have been made by the
clearing banks and by groups of large firms and financial institutions. Priority is
being given to the provision of relevant and accessible training for those setting
up or running small businesses, together with appropriate advisory services.

The Department of Trade and Industry’s programme of export support is
directed by the British Overseas Trade Board, whose members are mainly
business people with practical knowledge of exporting. Liaison is maintained
with the extensive network of Foreign and Commonwealth Office commercial
staff overseas. Services provided include advice on individual export markets
and opportunities, assistance for exhibitors at overseas trade fairs and
specialist advice on tariffs, regulations, technical requirements and product
approval procedures.
Direct government support for the tourism industry is provided by five statutory
bodies. The British Tourist Authority (BTA) is responsible for the overseas
promotion of tourism to Great Britain. The English, Scottish and Wales Tourist
Boards, which promote tourism in their respective countries, encourage the
development and improvement of tourist accommodation and amenities, and
administer grants, interest relief grants, and loans for projects to provide or
improve tourist amenities. The Scottish Tourist Board, unlike its English and
Welsh counterparts, is also empowered to carry out its own overseas promo¬
tional activities in consultation with the BTA; these activities are intended to
supplement, rather than replace, the overseas promotional work undertaken by
the BTA. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) has a promotional role
similar to that of the other boards; the BTA carries out overseas promotional
activities on behalf of the NITB on an agency basis.
The Government is providing extra funding for tourism in recognition of its
contribution to the economy, particularly in job creation. Leading government
objectives are to spread the benefits of tourism more widely around Britain and
to encourage the extension of the tourism season.
The European Community seeks to increase the degree of convergence between
the economies of member states and to ensure a more balanced distribution of
economic activities within the Community. The principal responsibility for
helping depressed areas remains with national authorities but the Community
may complement schemes through aid from a number of sources.
The European Regional Development Fund was established in 1975. Its purpose
is to contribute to the correction of the main regional imbalances within the
Community by participating in the development and structural adjustment of
regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining
industrial regions. The Fund’s resources are allocated between member states
on the basis of quota ranges; Britain has the third largest quota range. By
December 1986 about £2,290 million had been allocated to Britain, mainly for
the assisted areas (see p 233) and Northern Ireland, since 1975. In addition,
about £156 million has been allocated to Britain for specific programmes
running over several years to improve the environment and encourage the
development of employment in certain steel, shipbuilding, textile and fisheries
closure areas and in the border regions of Northern Ireland.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a self-governing institution set up by
the Treaty of Rome with member states of the European Community subscrib¬
ing to its capital. The Bank's aims are to help to stimulate development in
less-favoured regions, to modernise or convert industries, to help to create new

activities and to offset structural difficulties affecting certain sectors. The EIB
also serves projects of common interest to several member states or the
Community as a whole. It has loaned nearly £5,200 million since 1973 for
projects in Britain, mostly for public works such as the Sullom Voe oil terminal,
and manufacturing projects in the assisted areas.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) provides loans and grants to
encourage rational distribution of production and a high level of productivity in
the coal and steel industries while safeguarding employment and avoiding
unfair competition. Areas eligible for aid are coal industry projects, conversion
schemes, construction of housing for workers, allowances for redeployed
workers and research, including research of a social or medical nature.
Exchange risk cover may be provided by the Government on certain ECSC loans
for projects qualifying for regional selective assistance. The British borrower
takes on only a sterling liability.
A major feature of the Government’s economic policy is the stimulation of
competition and the control of practices which are restrictive or anti¬
competitive. Linked to this policy is the encouragement of fair trading, with the
particular aim of helping consumers and safeguarding their rights. The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Corporate and Consumer Affairs,
who is answerable to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, has special
responsibilities for competition policy and consumer affairs (although certain
matters, such as safety of foodstuffs and road vehicles, are the concern of other
departments). The Office of Fair Trading, a government agency headed by the
Director General of Fair Trading, has various executive responsibilities relating
to competition policy and consumer protection.
Competition policy is supported by machinery for scrutinising and regulating
monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive practices and restrictive trade practices,
and by powers to regulate any structural changes or anti-competitive practices
which operate against the public interest. The Director General of Fair Trading
administers the Fair Trading Act 1973, which deals with monopolies and
mergers, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which deals with restrictive
trading agreements, the Resale Prices Act 1976, which deals with minimum
resale price maintenance, and the Competition Act 1980, which deals with
anti-competitive practices. The Financial Services Act 1986 gives the Director
General further responsibilities. In 1986 the Government began a review of law
and policy on mergers and restrictive trade practices.
The Government is working to increase competition in professional services,
through relaxation of unjustifiable restrictive practices including restrictions on
fee scales and on advertising. Measures are being taken to improve competition
in conveyancing. The opticians’ monopoly on the dispensing of spectacles was
ended in 1984, and certain professional groups (for example, accountants,
solicitors and veterinary surgeons) have eased restrictions on advertising by
their members. Building societies are now allowed to offer a greater range of
services than in the past, which is bringing more competition to the fields of
financial services and estate agency.
The Government believes that most mergers have a ‘market rationale’ and in
most cases does not wish to intervene. However, it recognises the need to control
mergers which would result in excessive market shares; this is provided for by
the Fair Trading Act 1973.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Director General of Fair
Trading can refer monopolies for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers

Commission, an independent body whose members are drawn from a variety of
backgrounds, including lawyers, economists, industrialists and trade union¬
ists. The legislation defines a monopoly as a situation where at least a quarter of
a particular kind of goods or service is supplied by a single person or a group of
connected companies or by two or more people acting in a way which prevents,
restricts, or distorts competition. Local monopolies can also be referred to the
Commission, and the Secretary of State can refer public sector industries. If the
Commission finds that a monopoly operates against the public interest, the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has powers to take action to remedy or
prevent the harm which the Commission considers may exist. Alternatively the
Director General may be asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the adverse
effects identified by the Commission.
Proposals for a merger (defined as occurring when two or more enterprises are
brought under common ownership or control) may be referred to the Commis¬
sion by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, taking account of advice
from the Director General, if the merger would result in or intensify a monopoly
or if the total value of gross assets to be taken over would exceed £30 million. If
the Commission finds that a merger or proposed merger may be expected to
operate against the public interest, the Secretary of State can prevent it from
taking place or ask the Director General to obtain undertakings to remedy the
adverse effects identified; or, if it has already taken place, he can require it to be
reversed. There are special provisions for newspaper mergers.
The Government makes reference decisions primarily on competition
grounds; and, in evaluating the competitive situation, it has regard to the extent
of competition in the domestic market from overseas sources and to the
competitive position of British firms in overseas markets.
Subject to limited exemptions, the Director General can investigate any
business practice (whether in the public or private sectors) which may restrict,
distort or prevent competition in the production, supply or acquisition of goods
or services in Britain. If the Director General concludes that a practice is
anti-competitive he may either accept an undertaking from the business
responsible for the practice or, in default of such an undertaking, refer the
matter to the Commission to establish whether it operates against the public
interest. On an adverse finding by the Commission, the Secretary of State has
powers to take remedial action.
The Competition Act empowers the Secretary of State to refer to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission any questions concerning the efficiency and costs of,
the service provided by, or the possible abuse of a monopoly situation by, certain
bodies in the public sector. It is intended that at least one major examination of
each industry should take place every four years.
Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, certain kinds of restrictive
trading agreements have to be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading
for registration. Broadly, an agreement is registrable if two or more people who
are party to it supply goods or services in Britain and accept some limitation on
their freedom to make their own decisions about matters such as prices or
conditions of sale. Failure to register an agreement within the required period
means that the restrictions are void and the parties may be liable to legal
proceedings. Once an agreement has been registered, the Director General is
under a general duty to refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court, and the Court
must declare the restrictions in it contrary to the public interest unless the
parties can satisfy the Court by reference to criteria laid down in the Act that
this is not the case. Restrictions declared contrary to the public interest are void.

and the Court can order the parties not to give effect to them or make any similar
agreement. In practice, however, the great majority of agreements never reach
the Court because, for example, the parties elect to give up the restrictions
rather than go to court, or the Secretary of State accepts the Director General’s
advice that the restrictions are not significant enough to warrant reference to
the Court.
Under the Financial Services Act 1986 the Director General of Fair Trading is
required to report to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on the
implications for competition of rules, regulations, guidance and other arrange¬
ments which regulate investment businesses.
The objective of the European Community’s competition policy is to ensure that
there is free and fair competition in trade between member states and that the
government trade barriers which the Treaty of Rome seeks to dismantle are not
replaced by private barriers which fragment the common market. The competi¬
tion rules are set out in articles of the Treaty of Rome which are directly
applicable to member states and in regulations made under the articles. In most
areas of economic activity their enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the
European Commission, which has powers to investigate and terminate alleged
infringements and to impose fines.
The Treaty prohibits agreements or concerted practices which may affect
trade between member states and have as their object, or effect, the prevention,
restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. Agreements
meeting specified criteria may be exempted from this prohibition and, subject to
particular conditions and safeguards, certain categories of agreement are
exempted completely: these include agreements in respect of exclusive distribu¬
tion and purchasing, patent licensing, research and development, and motor
vehicle distribution and servicing. The Treaty also prohibits any abuse of a
dominant position within the common market or a substantial part of it to the
extent that it affects trade between member states.
In 1987 the Commission decided to remove barriers to competition and to the
free movement of goods, individuals, services and capital within the Community
by 1992.
In addition to laws designed to benefit customers by providing effective
competition, there is a body of legislation whose purpose is to ensure that
consumers are adequately protected.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs, for
action to deal with trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’ interests
and with persistent offenders under existing law, and for the negotiation of
self-regulatory codes of practice to raise trading standards. The Director General
is also responsible for the operation of legislation which regulates consumer
credit and hire business and estate agency work.
The consumer’s interests with regard to the purity of foods, the description
and performance of goods and services and pricing information are safeguarded
by the Food Act 1984, the Medicines Act 1968, the Trade Descriptions Act 1968,
the Prices Act 1974, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Sale of Goods Act
1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. The marking and accuracy
of quantities are regulated by the Weights and Measures Act 1985. The
Consumer Credit Act 1974 provides comprehensive protection for consumers
who enter into credit transactions. The Consumer Protection Act 1987
implements a harmonised European Community regime of civil law covering
product liability; establishes a general criminal offence of supplying unsafe

consumer goods; makes new provisions on misleading price indications; and
consolidates powers provided under safety-related Acts.
The Financial Services Act 1986 offers greater protection to investors by
establishing a new regulatory framework for the industry.
The European Community's consumer programme covers a number of impor¬
tant topics, such as health and safety, protection of the consumer’s economic
interests when purchasing goods and services, promotion of consumer educa¬
tion and strengthening the representation of consumers. The views of British
consumer organisations are represented by the Consumers in the European
Community Group (UK).
Advice and information on consumer matters is provided to the general public at
local level by the trading standards or consumer protection departments of local
authorities and in some areas by specialist Consumer Advice Centres. Citizens
Advice Bureaux also provide advice to the public on consumer matters.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which receives government finance, ensures
that the consumer’s view is made known to those in government, industry and
elsewhere whose decisions affect the consumer’s interest. In Northern Ireland
the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland (which became fully
operational in April 1985) has wide-ranging responsibilities in the field of
consumer protection and consumer affairs in general.
Consumer councils for the energy, rail and other nationalised industries and
the privatised gas industry investigate questions of concern to the consumer,
while some trade associations in industry and commerce have established codes
of practice. In addition, several private organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association, funded by the subscrip¬
tions of its membership of 900,000. The Association conducts an extensive
programme of comparative testing of goods and investigation of services; its
views and test reports are published in its monthly magazines and other
publications. The Association provides a legal advice service on subscription.
Local consumer groups, many belonging to a national federation, also promote
consumers’ interests and provide information and advice.
The formation and conduct of companies is regulated by the Companies Act
1985. ‘Incorporation’ involves registering with the Registrar of Companies in
Cardiff, Edinburgh or Belfast, depending on whether a company’s registered
office is in England or Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The Act also deals
with capital structure, the rights and duties of directors and members, and the
preparation and filing of accounts. Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies. Each company is a legal entity distinct from its members,
who are not as such liable for its debts. The liability of members of a.limited
company is limited to contributing an amount related to their shareholding. In
unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships or partnerships, by
contrast, individuals are personally liable for any business debts (except where a
member of a partnership is a limited liability company).
Companies may be either public or private. A company must satisfy three
conditions before it can be a public limited company (pic): it must be limited by
shares and have a share capital; it must state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company; and it must meet specified mini¬
mum capital requirements. All other registered companies are, by definition,
private companies and, as such, prohibited from offering their shares to the
public.
The consolidation of the Companies Acts 1948—83 has been completed and
came into force in July 1985; it restates existing law in a clearer and more
242
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
INDUSTRIAL
AND
INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY
convenient form, and makes application and interpretation easier for those
concerned with the regulation of company affairs. The consolidation resulted
in the Companies Act 1985 and three smaller Acts: the Business Names Act
1985, which regulates the names under which people may carry on business
in Great Britain; the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985, which
restates the law on insider dealing: and the Companies Consolidation (Con¬
sequential Provisions) Act 1985, which deals with the technical aspects of the
consolidation. (Powers to investigate suspected insider dealing were streng¬
thened in the Financial Services Act 1986, and it is proposed to increase the
penalties for such dealing.)
The Insolvency Act 1985 affects both corporate and individual insolvency
proceedings. It introduced for England, Wales and Scotland a licensing
procedure to ensure the professional competence, integrity and independence of
people who act as trustees of bankrupt individuals, or as liquidators, receivers
or administrators of insolvent companies. The Act also amended and sup¬
plemented the legislation relating to the winding-up of limited companies and
the appointment of receivers in England, Wales and Scotland. In so doing the
Act made substantial changes to parts of the Companies Act 1985. Subse¬
quently these parts were consolidated with the Insolvency Act 1985 into the
Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. A
new framework for dealing with directors of limited companies who are
demonstrably unfit to act as such came into operation in April 1986: they can be
disqualified from office and, in some cases, held personally liable for a
company's debts. It is now also possible for individual and corporate debtors to
reach agreements with their creditors without the necessity for formal
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The law relating to individual insolvency
proceedings in Scotland is now dealt with separately.
In October 1986 the Government announced a range of measures to improve
the investigation and prosecution of fraud. A Serious Fraud Office is to be set up
to collaborate with police work on fraud cases; restrictions on the use of
documentary evidence in court cases are to be relaxed; and court procedures are
to be streamlined.
There is a substantial body of legislation designed to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions, new industrial designs and trade marks. These
matters are administered by the Patent Office, which includes the Design
Registry and the Trade Marks Registry. The Patent Office is a division of the
Department of Trade and Industry. Protection is also available under the
European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty, and benefits
may be claimed in other countries by virtue of the International Convention for
the Protection of Industrial Property.
The Government is concerned to encourage innovation by providing a more
adequate legal and administrative system for the protection of the ownership of
ideas by means of patents, registered designs, trade marks and copyright, and to
improve awareness of the value of these intellectual property rights and of their
accessibility and usage, particularly by individuals and small businesses. In
April 1986 it published a White Paper setting out legislative and other proposals
covering the whole field of copyright and other aspects of intellectual property,
including the future operation of the Patent Office. Legislation to extend
copyright protection to owners of computer software was passed in July 1985.
The penalties for trading in pirate sound and film recordings (including video)
were greatly increased in 1983. In December 1986 a European Community
regulation empowering customs authorities to prevent the entry of counterfeit
goods bearing false trade marks came into effect. The law on trade marks was
extended to include services in October 1986.
12 Manufacturing
and Service
Industries
The manufacturing and service industries, together with construction, account
for about 91 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP), the remainder
being accounted for by energy production and agriculture. As in other developed
countries, rising living standards have led to a faster growth of demand for
services than for manufactures in recent decades, so that the proportion of GDP
accounted for by services has increased steadily and that of manufacturing has
fallen. The service industries described in this chapter are the traded ones such
as business services, distribution, and travel and tourism. Financial services
and large non-traded service sectors such as education, health and public
administration and defence are dealt with in other chapters.
Manufacturing
Structure Manufacturing accounted for some 24 per cent of gross domestic product in
1986 and for a similar proportion of total employment. Around 75 per cent of
visible exports consisted of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods, and
their value was about twice the value of exports of services.
Most manufacturing is carried out by private enterprise, and though the
greater parts of the iron and steel and shipbuilding industries are in public
ownership, the Government is reducing the extent of state ownership of
industry.
Table 14 shows the number of businesses in manufacturing in 1986. About
44 per cent of those employing over 1,000 people were in engineering and metals
and vehicle manufacturing. Within the private sector, the largest 100 companies
accounted for 33 per cent of manufacturing employment in 1984. The largest
manufacturing concerns (by £ million turnover in the latest financial year) are
BAT Industries (12,525), Imperial Chemical Industries (10,725), Unilever
(6,495), General Electric Company (5,222), Hanson Trust (4,312), Ford Motor
Company (4,045), the British Steel Corporation (3,736), Rover Group (3,415),
Thorn-EMI (3,204) and Gallaher (3,095).
Growth Manufacturing output, output per head and profitability have all risen from the
low point of the recession of 1980-81. In 1986 output was 11 per cent higher
than in 1981 (see Table 15). Output per head increased by a third between 1980
and 1986 a better record than that of the other major industrialised
economies. Net manufacturing profitability reached 7-2 per cent in 1986, the
highest rate of return on capital for 13 years, the level having risen steadily from
2 0 per cent in 1981. The severity of the recession was such, however, that by
1986, annual output had not quite regained the position reached in 1979, when
the index of output was 109-5 (1980=100). Part of the improvement in
productivity reflects the shedding of labour in the early 1980s which, as in other

MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
245
The recovery since 1981 has been most notable in chemicals and electrical and
instrument engineering, both in terms of output and productivity. Productivity
has also grown sharply in metal manufacturing (see Table 16), where there has
been extensive reorganisation and modernisation.
Investment in manufacturing tends to be cyclical and 1983 saw the beginning
of an upturn following a decline after 1979. In terms of constant (1980) prices
fixed investment increased by 35 per cent between 1982 and 1986, though it
was still less in 1986 than in 1979. Total fixed capital expenditure at current
prices was £9,075 million in 1986, comprising £7,351 million in plant and
machinery, £1,150 million in new building work and £574 million in vehicles.
Investment by sector is shown in Table 16. In addition, assets worth a further
£1,154 million were leased to manufacturers by the financial community.
The underlying level of manufacturing exports has risen in volume terms, on
the basis of overseas trade statistics, the index standing at 114 in 1986
(1980=100). This represented a recovery from a low point in 1983 when the
index was 95-5. British exporters were particularly affected during the recession
by a sharp rise in the exchange value of sterling. With the value of sterling at a
lower level in more recent years, manufacturing exports rose to £73,009 million
in 1986, on an industry basis, compared with £44,587 million in 1983 and
£38,675 million in 1980, at current prices. The leading exports in 1986 were
basic industrial chemicals (£4,841 million), aerospace (£4,299 million), data-
processing equipment (£3,094 million), telecommunications equipment, elec¬
trical instruments and electronic capital goods (£2,920 million), and motor
vehicle parts (£2,131 million). The value of exports exceeded that of imports in
each of these sectors except for data-processing equipment.
Import volumes rose strongly in the early 1980s, the index reaching 121-5 in
1983 and 148-2 in 1986. Imports were valued at £86,067 million in 1986.
High-
Technology
Industries
Take-up of
Advanced
Technology
The high-technology manufacturing industries in Britain can be defined as
falling mainly within electrical, electronic and instrument engineering, chemi¬
cals and aerospace. The definition is arrived at primarily by selecting those
industries with the highest levels of research and development spending in
relation to their gross output. In some cases assessments of the ratio of
scientific and technical staff to other staff are also counted.
Most of the electrical and electronic industries count for inclusion: office
machinery, electronic data-processing equipment, basic electrical equipment,
telecommunications equipment, electric instruments and control systems,
radio and electronic capital goods, and components. Within instrument
engineering, precision equipment for measuring and checking, and medical,
optical and photographic and filming equipment are included. In chemicals
the definition covers plastics materials, synthetic resins, synthetic rubbers
and pharmaceuticals. Aerospace production as a whole is defined as high-
technology.
The high-technology industries have shown strong growth in recent years
with levels of output, productivity and exports well above the average for
manufacturing. While the output of manufacturing industry as a whole grew by
5 per cent over the period 1980-86. that of high-technology manufacturing
sectors rose by 31 per cent.
Utilisation of advanced technology is steadily increasing in all sectors of British
industry . It has been estimated that the number of factories using microelectro¬
nic devices doubled between 1981 and 1985 to 53 per cent of all firms and 96 per

about half of all production processes in Britain and the proportion of factories
using computer-aided design (CAD) facilities in 1987 is estimated to be 30 per

cent. The number of British firms using robots more than doubled between
1984 and 1986. An outstanding example is the Cable and Wireless company's
new submarine cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS', which can work at depths up to
1 km (3,280 ft) controlled entirely by a computer on its mother ship. Many
British concerns are also making use of advanced materials, such as carbon
fibre composites in the aerospace industry, new types of plastics in the
automotive sector and high-fibre cholesterol-free protein in food production.
Among the traditional branches of heavy industry re-equipment and rationa¬
lisation has led to significant improvements in productivity in recent years. For
example, British Steel’s modernisation of its facilities at Port Talbot in south
Wales and elsewhere helped the company to make their first net profit for more
than a decade in 1985—86 and to raise labour productivity levels above those of
its West German and Japanese competitors. The widespread adoption of robots
has enabled the motor vehicle industry to become more efficient. This sector
spent over 50 per cent more on research and development in 1985 than it did
two years earlier.
The Government provides a range of grants to encourage firms to adopt new
techniques and materials such as biotechnology, fibre optics and microelectro¬
nics. Under the Microelectronics Industry Support Programme £120 million is
to be spent by 1990 to ensure that British firms keep up to date with the latest
developments in this field. The Government has already offered companies
assistance worth more than £38 million under the similar scheme for fibre
optics and optoelectronics. Finance is also available to help firms to pay for
consultancy work relating to the adoption of Advanced Manufacturing Tech¬
niques (AMT) and to its capital cost; £8-5 million was paid out under this
scheme in 1985-86. In 1986 the Department of Trade and Industry organised a
series of demonstrations in Birmingham to promote the use of computer
integrated manufacturing (CIM) techniques and the adoption of Manufacturing
Automation Protocol (MAP) and Technical Office Protocol (TOP) standards for
communication among computers. In addition to these initiatives to persuade
industry to adopt new technology, the Government also provides extensive
financial assistance to companies and research organisations seeking to
improve that technology.
The relative sizes of the various branches of manufacturing are shown in the
first columns of Tables 15 and 16. Table 16 also shows employment,
productivity and investment levels in each industry. A more detailed description
of the main branches is given in the sections that follow. The statistics in these
sections are supplied by the Statistical Division of the Department of Trade and
Industry. Unless otherwise stated, export and sales figures include parts, and
export figures include re-exports. The sales figures show the sales of principal
products made by each industry, so that they exclude, for example, any
non-electronic goods produced by firms classified to the electronics industry.
The labour figures show the number of people in employment in Great Britain in
mid-1986.
This group of industries suffered much less than any other manufacturing
industries as a result of the world-wide recession of the early 1980s. Output has
grown steadily since 1982. The output of electronic data-processing equipment
rose by 75 per cent between 1983 and 1986. Advances in microelectronics have
meant that the borderlines between office machinery, data-processing equip¬
ment, telecommunications equipment and consumer electronic equipment are
becoming even harder to define. The high-technology branches of this industry
are concentrated in the south east of Britain.

The computer sector, which has grown strongly over the past five years,
produces an extensive range of computer systems, central processors and
peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data-processing and
scientific work to mini- and microcomputers for use in control and automation
systems and for home, educational and office use. Although the market for
computers has begun to level out since 1986, some British electronics firms
have continued to experience rapid growth. Companies which have achieved
this by producing models using existing technology but at a very competitive
price include Amstrad with their new range of low-cost IBM-compatible
computers. Other companies have succeeded by developing new products for
specialised markets, such as the transputer, produced by Inmos, a Thorn-EMI
subsidiary; in ef/ect a computer on a single chip, a transputer can be combined
with hundreds of others in parallel to form a machine as powerful as existing
‘supercomputers' but at less than a quarter of their price. British firms and
research organisations, with government support, are also heavily involved in
the development and application of the new family of three-five' semiconductor
materials, such as gallium arsenide, which will ultimately enable much faster
computers to be produced and are already used in a number of microwave
devices.
British companies are strongly involved in the development of electronic
revenue control equipment, including electronic funds transfer and point of sale
equipment. The first large-scale trial of cashless shopping in Britain began in
Northampton in October 1985, using equipment manufactured by ICL. Recent
export orders include one for integrated store systems for a group of 139 retail
stores across the United States. British-made computerised ticketing equip¬
ment is being installed throughout British Rail's network.
The main communications products are switching and transmission equip¬
ment, telephones and terminals for telex, facsimile and teletext. British Telecom
(BT) is the main customer for network equipment and carries out research and
development work in co-operation with suppliers. Mercury Communications
has been licensed to compete with BT in the provision of network services, while
the market for terminals and telephones has been fully liberalised. Innovative
work is being particularly stimulated by the expansion of cable television and
the growth in value added network services. In 1984, two cellular radio networks
began operation. They provide sophisticated telephone services on portable
telephones.
One important part of the industry produces transmission equipment and
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
249
cables for telecommunications and information networks and other purposes.
Its products include submarine and high-specification data-carrying cables. BT,
supported by a technically advanced cable industry, has led the way in the
development of optical fibre communications systems. In 1986 it opened the
world's first international submarine optical fibre link, which has doubled the
number of telephone lines between Britain and Belgium. BT has also paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by laying the first non-repeatered
cable, over 100 km (62 miles) long, and developing the first all-optical repeater.
Well over half of the world's undersea communications cables (of all types) have
been made and laid by another British company, STC Submarine Systems,
which plans, with its US and French partners, to complete the laying of the first
transatlantic optical fibre cable in 1988. Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along telephone lines for reproduction on
television screens. British Telecom's Prestel service is now capable of transmit¬
ting full-colour photographs to domestic television reception quality. Sales of
telegraph and telephone apparatus and equipment by British firms more than
doubled between 1979 and 1986.
Another expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufac¬
ture of radio communications equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging systems, alarms and signalling
equipment, public broadcasting equipment and other capital goods. Radar was
invented in Britain and British firms are still in the forefront of technical
advances. Racal Avionics’ new X-band radar can distinguish different types of
aircraft flying at very low altitude and is already in use at airports in several
countries. GLORIA is a new type of ship-towed side-scan sonar, developed at
Britain's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences and now being used for the United
States Geological Survey to map the ocean floor within the US 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zones.
A range of electrical and electronic measurement and test equipment is made
in Britain, as well as analytical instruments. Production of process control
equipment is a large and expanding area along with the manufacture of
numerical control and indication equipment for use in machine tools. British
companies are among the leaders in several types of advanced electronic medical
equipment. Pioneering work has been undertaken in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), a technique in which the patient is placed in a strong magnetic
field and scanned with radiofrequency (RF) energy. The body interacts with this
energy and the information generated is processed by computer to construct
images of internal organs and tissues. MRI enables large areas of the body to be
examined internally without recourse to surgery or potentially harmful radia¬
tion. Developments in the field of laser technology over the last 25 years have
also enabled British doctors in 1986 to invent new techniques for destroying
cancers in their early stages and for unblocking arteries.
British companies also produce other advanced electronic medical equipment
including ultrasound scanners, electromyography systems and patient monitor¬
ing systems for intensive and coronary care and other uses.
The comprehensive indigenous electronics components industry is sup¬
plemented by subsidiaries of a number of large overseas companies. The
manufacture of integrated circuits is an area of particularly rapid change.
Britain has strength in the manufacture of advanced components, especially in
semi-custom devices such as gate arrays and transputers.
The electrical engineering industry manufactures a wide variety of products
for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, ranging from
power plant, transformers and switchgear to lighting, plugs and sockets. A
mature industry, it nevertheless makes extensive use of advanced technologies
in its products and processes. It also earns a considerable foreign trade surplus;
250

Chemicals and
Man-made
Fibres
for example, GEC won a £250 million contract to supply two 985-megawatt
turbine generators to China in 1986.
The domestic electrical appliance sector is dominated by a few large firms. The
major electronic consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio and video equipment. In the audio field, British
manufacturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in
the mass market.
The instrument engineering industry produces measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic equipment; watches, clocks and other
timing devices; and medical and surgical instruments and appliances. Its
precision instrument and medical branches both earn significant and growing
export surpluses, but the sector as a whole is contracting.
Britain’s chemicals industry is the third largest in Western Europe and the fifth
largest in the non-communist world. Nearly half of its production is exported
and in 1986 it contributed nearly £2,300 million to the country’s balance of
payments. One company. Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), accounts for about
a quarter of the industry's production and is the fifth largest chemicals company
in the world. Traditionally Britain has been a major producer of basic industrial
chemicals, such as inorganic and basic organic chemicals, plastics and
fertilisers. Although these sectors still make up about 40 per cent of the
industry's output, the most rapid growth in recent years has been in the
production of speciality and problem-solving' chemicals, especially pharma¬
ceuticals, pesticides, and cosmetics.

Pharmaceuticals were responsible for about a third of the chemical sector’s
overseas trade surplus in 1986. Of the five best-selling drugs in the world in
1985, four were discovered in British laboratories and three, Glaxo's ulcer
treatment Zantac and Id's beta-blockers Tenormin and Inderal, which reduce
blood pressure, are manufactured by British companies. The United States
subsidiary of Britain's Wellcome Foundation has been responsible for the first
drug for the treatment of AIDS to win government approval and also for the first
routine treatment for the herpes group of viruses. Among other recent major
developments pioneered in Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins, new treat¬
ments for asthma and arthritis, and synthetic insulin. Britain is among the
world leaders in the production of antibiotics by fermentation.
In the field of biotechnology the British Celltech company were the first to be
licensed by the United States Food and Drugs Administration for the mass
production of monoclonal antibodies, proteins which each seek out a particular
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES

natural substance. They are used to diagnose diseases and identify different
blood types and can be used in the treatment of cancer.
Britain is foremost among the world’s developers of molecular graphics, a
computer-aided technique for studying the structure of complicated organic
molecules on a visual display unit, eliminating the need for many physical tests
of drugs.
Notable recent British discoveries and developments in agricultural chemicals
include pyrethroid insecticides, ICI's diquat and paraquat herbicides, systemic
fungicides and aphicides, genetically engineered microbial pesticides and
methods of encouraging natural parasites to attack common pests in horticul¬
ture. A substantial proportion of world research and development in agro¬
chemicals is conducted in Britain.
Exports of cosmetics, toiletries and perfumery in 1986 were £370 million,
compared with imports of less than £230 million. The home market amounted
to about £1,170 million at manufacturers’ prices.
A high proportion of inorganic chemicals production consists of relatively
simple bulk chemicals, such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-metallic
oxides, serving as basic materials for industry. The most important products in
the organic chemicals range (by weight) are ethylene (1,475,000 tonnes
produced in 1986), propylene (857,000 tonnes) and benzene (860,000 tonnes).
Over 30 per cent of plastics production is exported. Expansion in recent years
has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polypropylene. A new group of
plastics materials reinforced with carbon fibres is also in commercial produc¬
tion; they have up to three times the strength but are only 20 per cent of the
weight of steel, and are being increasingly used in aircraft and vehicle
manufacture. ICI have recently produced the world's first biodegradable
thermoplastic, Biopol, which is used as a slow release agent for drugs and
herbicides, as well as for making bottles and films that can be disposed of
without polluting the environment. Synthetic rubbers in large-scale production
include butadiene-based neoprene for tyres, high-styrene for shoe soles and
flooring and oil-resistant nitrile rubbers.
Specialised products in the paint industry include new ranges of synthetic
resins and pigments, powder coatings, non-drip and quick-drying paints and
paints needing only one top coat. Two significant recent innovations have been
solid emulsion paint and a temporary water-based finish for vehicle bodies and
road markings, which can be removed easily by chemical treatment. Following
its purchase of the US Glidden concern in 1986, ICI became the world’s largest
paint manufacturer.
The main types of man-made fibre are still those first developed—regenerated
cellulosic fibres such as viscose and the major synthetic fibres such as nylon
polyamide, polyester and acrylics. Extensive research continues to produce a
wide variety of innovative products with characteristics designed to meet market
needs, such as anti-static and flame-retardant fibres. More specialist products
include the aramids (with very high thermal stability and strength), elastanes
(giving very high stretch and recovery), melded fabrics (produced without the
need for knitting or weaving) and carbon fibres (originally developed for the
aerospace industry but now finding applications in other industries such as
motor vehicles and sports goods).
Britain's aerospace industry is the third largest in the world, behind those of the
United States and the Soviet Union. In 1986 it had a turnover of £8,000 million,
with exports totalling £4,700 million, and contributed nearly £2,000 million to
the balance of payments. Almost half of this export effort was due to the
country's main airframe manufacturer, British Aerospace (BAe), which had an
252
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
order-book at the beginning of 1987 worth some £8,600 million. BAe manufac¬
tures a uniquely extensive range of aerospace, space and electronics products.
Its major aircraft programmes are: on the civil side, the 146 family of regional
airliners (one of the two quietest jetliners in the world, the other being the
Rolls-Royce-engined Boeing 757), the new ATP advanced turboprop airliner, the
Jetstream 31 commuterliner and the 125 business jet: and, on the military side,
the V-STOL Harrier, the Hawk trainer and, in collaboration with Federal
German and Italian aerospace manufacturers, the Tornado combat aircraft. BAe
is also the main airframe contractor for the European fighter aircraft project
(EAP), which involves Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain.
BAe owns 20 per cent of the European consortium Airbus Industrie which, at
the end of the first quarter of 1987, had more than 450 orders for its
wide-bodied A300 and A310 Airbuses and more than 440 firm orders and
options for the new narrow-bodied A320, for all of which the British company
makes the wings. Both the A320 and BAe's demonstrator for the EAP use the
new 'fly-by-wire' system, which controls an aircraft by electronic rather than
mechanical means. This active control technology' greatly improves manoeuvra¬
bility and allows much more aerodynamically efficient aircraft to be built.

BAe is also a major producer of air-, sea- and ground-launched guided
weapons, including the Rapier air defence system. Collaborative guided weapon
projects between Britain and its NATO partners are becoming increasingly
important.
The government-owned firm Short Brothers of Belfast produces the Sherpa
military transporter, the Tucano basic trainer aircraft (to be used by the Royal
Air Force), the SD330 and 360 commuter airliners, a wide variety of airframe
components for manufacturers in many countries, and missiles. In addition to
performing a wide range of aerospace equipment work, Westland Helicopters
manufactures the Sea King and Lynx military helicopters, the civilian W30, and
is collaborating with Agusta of Italy to produce the multi-role EH 101 for the early
1990s. In 1986 a Lynx fitted with Westland's new 'Berp-tip' rotor set a new
helicopter world speed record at over 400 km/h (249 mph).
Rolls-Royce, which was privatised in May 1987, is one of the three largest
manufacturers of aero-engines in the world. The order-book at the end of March
1987 stood at £3,000 million. The company's civil engine group produces
engines for airliners, transport aircraft and executive and corporate jets. Of its
RB211 family of engines, the 524D4D was launched in 1986 with orders from
Cathay Pacific and British Airways to power the new Boeing 747-400 airliner; 14
out of 19 customers for the Boeing 757 have specified the 535 version. The new
Tay turbofan, which is to go into service with the Gulfstream IV and Fokker 100
aircraft, had orders and options worth nearly £600 million at the end of 1986.
Rolls-Royce is also a major partner in the five-nation International Aero Engines
(LAE) consortium that is producing the V2500 which is scheduled for entry into
service in 1989 on the new Airbus A320.
The military engine group of Rolls-Royce is responsible for a wide range of
engines for military aircraft and helicopters. These engines include the

Turbo-Union RBI99 for the Panavia Tornado aircraft, the unique Pegasus
veetored-thrust engine for the Harrier, the Adour, the Spey and the advanced
RTM322 helicopter engine. Rolls-Royce is also a partner in the consortium
formed to develop the EJ200 for the proposed European Fighter Aircraft. In
addition, the company produces gas turbines for power generation and for oil
and gas pumping. It also provides gas turbine power for vessels of 25 of the
world's naval forces and the propulsion systems for the Royal Navy's nuclear-
powered submarines.
Aviation equipment manufacturers provide a wide range of systems essential
to engines and aircraft, including engine and flight controls, electrical genera¬
tion, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings, flight deck
control and information displays. British firms have also made important
advances in the development of ejector seats, firefighting equipment and flight
simulators, and are playing a major role in the development of both fly-by-wire
and fly-by-light technology. They supply radar and air traffic control equipment
and ground power supplies to airports and airlines throughout the world.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aerospace
Companies, which organises a major international air show at Farnborough,
Hampshire, every two years (the next in September 1988).
The British space industry's major strength is in the manufacture of satellites.
BAe is the world's third largest producer of communications satellites and has
been the prime contractor for all such spacecraft launched by the European
Space Agency (ESA), as well as for scientific probes such as the Giotto satellite,
which investigated Halley's Comet during 1986. BAe has also developed and
built some 17 space pallets (payload and instrument carriers) for the United
States Space Shuttle and has a major role in several international satellite
projects.
Marconi Space Systems has primed many telecommunications satellite
payloads, including those for the ESA's Olympus satellite, to be launched in
1989, and the International Maritime Satellite Organisation’s spacecraft, the
second generation of which will go into orbit in 1988. In January 1987 BAe and
Marconi together won an order from NATO for satellites worth more than £100
million, the first time such an order had gone to a non-US company.
Britain is the world’s tenth largest steel-producing nation (by volume). British
producers delivered 13-1 million tonnes of finished steel in 1986, of which 64
per cent was sold on the home market and the remainder exported. The British
Steel Corporation (BSC) is the world's fourth largest steel company and accounts
for some 78—80 per cent of crude steel production in Britain. BSC’s output is
now based on flat products, plate, heavy sections, tubes and stainless items.
Private sector firms are prominent in the manufacture of engineering and other
special steels, wire rod and wire products, reinforcements for use in the
construction industry, and other more specialised goods. Steel manufacture is
concentrated in Wales, Scotland and northern England.
The industry has recorded sharp improvements in productivity in recent
years, partly as a result of an extensive programme of rationalisation and
closures: whereas it took BSC 14-3 man hours to produce a tonne of liquid steel
in 1978-79, it took only 6-3 man hours in 1985-86. Most private sector firms
have shown improved profitability and in 1985—86 BSC returned a net profit of
£38 million, its first for ten years.
The first steps have been taken to return to a free market in steel within the
European Community, accompanied by a ban on state aid.
Output in 1986 included: aluminium (276,000 tonnes of primary metal and
116,000 tonnes of secondary metal): refined copper (62,000 tonnes of primary

primary metal and 174,000 tonnes of secondary metal): and zinc (86,000 tonnes of
slab metal). Primary metal production relies mainly on imported ores, concentrates
and partially refined metal.
Britain is also a major producer of specialised alloys for high-technology
requirements in the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and nuclear and other
fuel industries. Titanium and titanium alloys are produced and used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea oil production.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the midlands and Wales. In recent years
considerable progress has been made in the development of ‘superplastic’ alloys,
which are more ductile and elastic than conventional alloys. Aluminium lithium is
a relatively new alloy which has been developed by British Alcan Aluminium and
already used in experimental aircraft construction. It is up to 20 per cent lighter
than traditional materials and is stronger, stiffer and more resistant to fatigue.
Exports of aluminium and aluminium alloys reached £392 million in 1986 while
exports of copper, brass and other copper alloys reached £124 million. Exports of
silver, platinum and other precious metals totalled over £740 million in 1986.
The pottery industry, centred in Staffordshire, uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. Britain is the world's biggest exporter of china clay, which
was the country's largest mineral export until the discovery of North Sea oil.
Domestic pottery, including china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for
54 per cent of the industry's output. Production of tableware is concentrated in two
major groups, Wedgwood and Royal Doulton. Britain is the world's principal
manufacturer of fine bone china, much of which is exported; famous makes
include Wedgwood, Royal Worcester, Spode, Royal Doulton, Minton, Aynsley,
Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Research is being conducted into ceramics for use in housebuilding and diesel
and jet engines. Important industrial ceramics invented in Britain include silicon
carbides developed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and sialons
developed at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Among building materials glass-reinforced cement composites were invented in
Britain in the early 1970s and are manufactured under licence in over 40
countries.
Containers form the largest part of the glass industry. Another major section is
devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various forms, chiefly by the float
glass process developed in Britain by Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkingtons have also developed an energy¬
saving window glass which reflects room heat without impairing visibility.

Since much of the production of this industry is of capital equipment, it suffered
particularly during the recession which began in 1979. However, in 1984 and 1985
there was a recovery in some parts of the industry. In 1986 sales of mechanical
engineering as a whole rose by 2 per cent, with rises of 14 per cent in printing
machinery, 10 per cent in chemical industry and textile machinery, and 27 per
cent in mining machinery. Over 40 per cent of the industry’s sales are exported,
and exports in 1986 amounted to 11 per cent of all visible exports.

Of particular importance are fabricated steel products such as pressure vessels,
heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil-refining (process) plant,
steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power stations), nuclear
reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and fabricated steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations.
Although the agricultural machinery industry’s output fell sharply as world
demand contracted in the 1970s, Britain is still the Western world’s largest
producer of tractors, which make up two-thirds of the country’s total output of
agricultural equipment. In 1986 this was £1,154 million, of which 74 per cent was
exported, with a trade surplus of £221 million. Recent technical innovations
include computer-controlled tractors, a highly efficient pesticide sprayer and
combined mower/conditioners that significantly reduce the drying time for grass.
Much of the new machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet
the needs of overseas farmers, and since 1984 the Royal International Agricultural
Show, held annually near Coventry, has had a specialised tropical machinery
centre, where demonstrations of such machinery are given.
Almost all of Britain's machine tools are purchased by the engineering, vehicles
and metal goods industries. The recession in these sectors cut the sales of machine
tools until 1983, since when they have expanded by 33 per cent. The most
commonly used metal-cutting machine tools are milling, grinding and turning
machines. The manufacture of computerised numerically controlled machine tools
and the adoption of flexible manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly
important. Output and exports of machine tools in 1986 were both more than
30 per cent higher than in 1983, following a recovery in 1984—85.

In 1986, some 76 per cent of the sales of textile machineiy were to export
markets. Recent British innovations in this field include computerised colour
matching and weave simulation, friction spinning, high-speed computer-
controlled knitting machines and electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms.
Within the ordnance, small arms and munitions industry, which earned a
foreign trade surplus of £302 million in 1986, the Government agreed the sale of
its Royal Ordnance factories to British Aerospace in April 1987.
Overseas sales of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment are substantial,
while exports of construction equipment amounted to £858 million in 1986 (86
per cent of output). J. C. Bamford Ltd is the world’s second largest manufacturer of
backhoe loaders. It exports 60 per cent of its output, despite a steady fall in world
demand between 1980 and 1984. The British mining equipment industry is very
strong, especially in the production of coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying equipment, flameproof trans¬
formers, switchgear, and subsurface transport equipment and control systems.
Exports of coal-mining equipment in 1986 were £105 million, 48 per cent up on
the previous year. The main products of the mechanical handling equipment
industry are cranes and transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists,
powered industrial trucks and air bridges. Electronically controlled and completely
automatic handling systems are also produced. Britain is also an important
producer of other machinery such as industrial engines, pumps, valves and
compressors, and pneumatic and hydraulic equipment.
Despite an overall decline in the castings industry, some foundries have been
investing in new melting, moulding and quality control equipment. Cosworth
Engineering, for example, has developed a high-quality aluminium casting process
and uses it to produce cylinder heads in quantity for Mercedes and Ford cars.
Output of cars is dominated by four groups which account for 96 per cent of car
production: Rover, in which there is a majority public shareholding. Ford,
Vauxhall and Peugeot-Talbot. The remainder is in the hands of smaller, speciadist
producers of cars such as Jaguar and Rolls-Royce, whose cars are renowned for
their quality and durability (some 65 per cent of all Rolls-Royce cars built since
1904 are still roadworthy). The Rover Group shares the Government's commitment
to return the company to private ownership. Following the flotation of Jaguar in
1984, Rover’s bus and Danish operations and its majority interests in Unipart,
Istel (its computer subsidiary) and its Australian business were all sold to their
respective managements and employees during 1987.
In view of the over-capacity in the European truck industry, in 1986 General
Motors (who also own Vauxhall) ended production of civilian trucks at their
Bedford plant, and in 1987 Rover merged its truck, van, associated parts and

In recent years the home market has been increasingly supplied by imports,
mainly from other European countries and Japan, but British manufacturers are
responding to the competition, and import penetration was reduced in 1986. The
industry remains a major exporter; in 1986 Jaguar's exports alone amounted to
more than £560 million. The Japanese manufacturer Nissan opened a car
assembly plant in Britain in 1986, while Rover launched its new executive car
which was designed and developed in collaboration with Honda. In 1987 Rover also
announced its intention to develop a new medium-sized car with the Japanese
company.
Major component manufacturers include GKN and Lucas, which has developed a
new cheap anti-lock braking system and the first direct fuel injection system for
small high-speed automotive diesel engines.
The motor industry is centred on the West Midlands and the South East.
About half of the market for pedal cycles is supplied by British firms, the largest
of which is Raleigh, which was taken over by the specially created Derby
International Corporation in January 1987.
In the past British Rail met its rolling stock requirements from its wholly owned
subsidiary, British Rail Engineering Ltd (BREL). However, since early 1985 all
British Rail's orders have had to be put out to open tender, and BREL now
competes alongside the large private sector. Both BREL and private companies
export equipment and provide consultancy services overseas.
Britain has a long tradition of shipbuilding and remains active in the construc¬
tion, conversion and repair of merchant vessels, warships and offshore structures.
The largest sector is the building of warships, including both nuclear-powered
and diesel-electric submarines, frigates, glass-reinforced plastics vessels, fast
patrol craft and specialist naval auxiliaries. As well as meeting all the needs of the
Royal Navy, the warship yards build and convert ships for overseas governments.
British yards build some of the most sophisticated and technologically complex
merchant vessels in the world, including ferries, and offshore support and
research vessels as well as more traditional ships and craft of all kinds for the
leisure market. In 1986 British companies accounted for some 2 per cent of world
merchant ship completions, about 20 per cent of which were for overseas
registration. The shipbuilding industry is supplemented by ship-repairers,
including the Royal Dockyards, which the Government leased to commercial
management in April 1987. Repairers also modernise and convert all types of
vessels and floating structures.
The British marine equipment industry offers a range of products from anchors
to sophisticated navigational systems. Exports account for 70 per cent of the
industry’s production.
Nearly two decades of oil exploration and exploitation in the North Sea has
generated a major offshore industry in Britain. Shipbuilders and fabricators build
fixed platforms and semi-submersible units for drilling, production and
emergency/maintenance support, drill ships, jack-up rigs, modules and offshore
loading systems. Over 4,000 manufacturing and service industry firms supply a
wide range of goods and services, including consultancy, design, project manage¬
ment, and research and development, to the offshore industry. In conjunction with
the Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy, the Department of Trade
and Industry has a responsibility for promoting Britain’s offshore interests
overseas and maintains a central co-ordination unit to assist this activity.
Britain has a relatively large and sophisticated food processing industry, which
has accounted for a growing proportion of total domestic food supply in recent
258
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
decades, though the rate of growth has slowed since the early 1970s.
Convenience foods, particularly frozen foods, yoghurts and instant snacks, have
formed the fastest-growing sector. The market is also growing in foods for
consumers concerned about the effects of their diet on their health and weight.
While Britain is a net importer of foodstuffs, the volume of imports declined
between 1970 and 1980, since when it has risen for most types of foodstuff,
notable exceptions being meat and cereals and products based on them. Exports
have grown steadily. Basic research is being conducted into new sources of food.
Ranks Hovis McDougall and ICI jointly launched in 1984 a new food from a
fungus grown in continuous fermentation on glucose.
Food from Britain is a body with a wide remit to improve the marketing of
British food and agricultural produce both domestically and overseas. It has
selected France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Benelux countries and the
United States as key export markets.
Production of milk was some 15,608 million litres inl986, of which just under
half was for sale as liquid milk. Eight out of ten households in Britain receive
pasteurised milk through a door-step delivery system employing about 37,000
roundsmen (not included in the employment figure in the table) driving electric
vehicles. Domestic milk consumption per head (1-7 litres—3 pints—per week in
1986) is among the highest in the world.
The main milk products are butter (220,000 tonnes produced in 1986), cheese
(255,000 tonnes), full-cream condensed milk (160,000 tonnes), full-cream milk
powder (45,000 tonnes), and skimmed milk powder (277,000 tonnes). These
levels of production have remained approximately the same since 1981, after
significant rises in butter and cheese production in the late 1970s. The dairy
industry accounted for 66 per cent of new butter supplies to the British market
in 1986, 65 per cent of new cheese supplies, and nearly all of other milk
products. Butter exports in 1986 were 33,000 tonnes and cheese exports 34,000
tonnes, compared with 16,000 tonnes and 10,700 tonnes in 1976. The other
main exports are skimmed milk powder (170,000 tonnes in 1986) and whole
milk powder (44,000 tonnes).
About 70 per cent of bread is manufactured in large mechanised bakeries,
most of which use a British process (the ‘Chorleywood' process) widely used in
other countries. There is a growing consumer interest, however, in locally baked
varieties, and in recent years demand for wholemeal bread has grown
considerably. Biscuit exports (£123 million in 1986) are more than double the
value of imports.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic drinks produced in Britain, and in
the food and drink industry as a whole, is Scotch whisky. There are about 115
distilleries in Scotland and the well-known brands of blended Scotch whisky are
made from the products of a number of different distilleries. Guinness pic,
owners of the Distillers Company and Arthur Bell and Sons, accounts for 40 per
cent of Scotch whisky output and 25 per cent of the British market. About 85
per cent of all Scotch whisky produced is exported. The value of whisky exports
was over £1,000 million in 1986, the United States taking about a quarter.
In the brewing and malting industry there are six major brewery groups whose
products are sold nationally. Demand for traditional cask-conditioned ales grew
substantially in the 1970s but has now stabilised. The main raw materials used
are malt, hops and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from
home-grown barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. Lager has
increased steadily in popularity since the late 1960s and accounts for over 50 per
cent of beer sales.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There are
some very large companies among about 20 producing brands which are
marketed on a national scale.

The British tobacco industry manufactures about 90 per cent of cigarettes
and tobacco goods sold in Britain. Approximately 90 per cent of output is
provided by three major manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher and
Carreras Rothmans). The industry specialises in the production of high-quality
cigarettes made from flue-cured tobacco and achieves significant exports,
mainly of cigarettes—countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important markets. Britain's most important sources of raw tobacco are Brazil,
the United States, Zimbabwe, India and Canada. By voluntary agreement with
the Government, cigarette manufacturers restrict their advertising, print health
warnings on packets and are reducing the tar yield of cigarettes.
Despite its contraction over a number of years, this is still a large group of
related industries, employing over 500,000 people and making substantial
exports. Its main products are yarn, woven and knitted fabrics, apparel,
household textiles and carpets based mainly on wool, cotton and man-made
fibres. The textiles industry has some 5,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies such as Courtaulds and Coats Viyella, and a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
The textiles and clothing industries in Britain, as in other developed
countries, have been affected by low-cost imports from developing countries.
Trade in textiles and clothing is regulated by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The MFA allows a measure of
restraint on imports of textiles and clothing from low-cost countries into
industrialised countries; agreement on a fourth MFA, which will last for five
years, was reached in August 1986. The use of computers and robots and other
automated techniques in production processes is helping the textiles, footwear
and clothing industries to compete against low-cost countries. Weft insertion in
fabrics, for example, is now largely carried out by fast computer-controlled
machines using bullets', thin blades or air or water jets, instead of the
traditional loom.
In 1986 exports of tops (combed wool and hair), wool yarns, fabrics and other
wool textile products exceeded imports by about 23 per cent. The industry is one
260
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the largest in the world and includes the world's biggest wool textile company,
Illingworth Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and worsted. An
increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area but Scotland and the west of England are also
famous as specialised producers of high-quality yarn and cloth. Large quantities
of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain in preparation for spinning.
British mills also process the bulk of rare fibres, such as cashmere and mohair,
entering world trade.

Low-cost competition has cut progressively into British markets for cotton.
Production includes yarn and fabrics of cotton, spun man-made fibres and
mixtures of these. The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the
lighter types of fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are
produced. The heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins
is mainly produced in Scotland. The hosiery and knitwear industry comprises
about 1,700 companies situated mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland, of
which most are small to medium in size.
Some 50 per cent of the value of carpet and rug output (76 per cent in volume
terms) is made up of tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually
with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing.
Woven carpets, mainly Axminster, account for most of the remainder of sales.
There is a higher wool content in woven types, although in these, too, more use
is being made of man-made fibres. The high quality and variety of design make
Britain one of the world's leading producers of woven carpets.
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and
man-made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets,
cordage and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the
packaging, upholstery, building and motor-car industries.
The clothing industry is highly labour intensive with about 9,700 companies
(predominantly small ones), accounting for 5 to 6 per cent of Britain’s total
employment in manufacturing. It supplies about two-thirds of domestic
demand, while exports have risen since the mid-1970s. The British fashion
designer industry became much more active in the mid-1980s. A wide range of
clothing is imported from European and Asian countries. The footwear
manufacturing industry is made up predominantly of small companies. It

supplies about 43 per cent of all the shoes sold in Britain. Imports have risen in
recent years, but latterly at a very slow rate. About one-third of leather
production is exported.
The furniture industry comprises about 5,600 companies, mostly small to
medium-sized. Domestic production of softwood timber has been steadily
increasing but the timber-using industries are mainly dependent on imported
supplies.
There were about 110 paper and board mills in 1986, operated by 70
companies; total production was nearly 4 million tonnes. The largest British
groups are Wiggins Teape, the Dickinson Robinson Group and Reed Interna¬
tional. Overseas paper and board groups with manufacturing investments in
Britain include Georgia Pacific, Kimberly Clark, Consolidated Bathurst, the
Scott Corporation and United Paper Mills of Finland.
There has been a significant trend towards waste-based packaging grades in
order to reduce the industry's reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. The use
of recycled waste paper is increasing and research is helping to extend it. Waste
paper provides over half of the industry's fibre needs. Domestically produced
wood pulp represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies.

Mergers have led to the formation of large groups in newspaper, magazine and
book publishing, the largest being the British Printing and Communications
Corporation; but general printing, engraving, bookbinding and a large part of
publishing still include many small firms. With increasing use of new
technology, such as computer typesetting, fragmentation of the industry into
small specialised units has taken place in the 1980s. The book publishing
industry is a major exporter, selling one-third of production in overseas
markets. Security printers (of, for example, banknotes and postage stamps) are
important exporters, the major company being De La Rue.
Tyres and tubes represent about 45 per cent of sales of rubber manufactures,
the most important other goods being vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, hoses, latex foam products, and footwear, gloves and
clothing. Tyre manufacturers include subsidiaries of United States and other
overseas companies. The industry's consumption of rubber includes natural,
synthetic and recycled rubber.
There are about 500 manufacturers of a wide range of toys and games, but few
of significant size. About 50 per cent of total production is exported. There are
about 400 manufacturers of sports equipment. British fishing tackle and golf
and tennis equipment are established in export markets.
Jewellery, gold and silverware and the refining of precious metals is an
industry with a strong craft tradition. The Royal Mint makes coins for over 70
overseas countries.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Structure
Construction
The construction industry accounts for about 6 per cent of gross domestic
product. The total value of output in Great Britain in 1986 was £30,031 million,
of which new work accounted for £16,238 million (54 per cent) and repairs and
maintenance the remainder. In housing, new work was valued at £5,526 million
and repairs and maintenance at £7,395 million. About 1 million people are
employed in the industry (including apprentices), accounting for about 4 per
cent of the employed labour force. There are also about 487,000 self-employed.
Efficiency and productivity within the industry are benefiting from new
computerised techniques such as the use of electronic load safety measures for
cranes, distance measuring equipment, computerised stock ordering and job
costing, and computer-aided design. Increasingly, major contractors are manag¬
ing projects (particularly higher value ones) and using subcontractors to do the
actual work.
Government sponsorship of the construction industry is the responsibility of
the Department of the Environment. Building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and Wales. Made by the Secretary of State
for the Environment and administered and enforced by local authorities, the
regulations apply to new building, the installation or replacement of fittings,
and alterations and extensions to existing buildings. There are broadly similar
controls under separate legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland. As an
alternative to local authority building control and in order to simplify proce¬
dures, an optional system of private certification of compliance with building
regulations is provided for in the Housing and Building Control Act 1984 and
was introduced in 1985. The British Board of Agrement, sponsored by the
Department, assesses and issues reports and certificates relating to products
and systems for use in the construction industry. The Government is now keen
to see quality assurance extended to the construction process as well as the
materials used. In November 1986 the Institute of Plumbing became the first
body to have its register covered by the British Standards Institution’s Public
Register Inspection Maintenance Assessment (PRIMA) scheme.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1986 about 90 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were about 95,000 firms
employing two or more people, 95 per cent of them employed fewer than 25.
Some large firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake responsi¬
bility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The latter, acting on behalf of a client, may advise on the
feasibility of projects, draw up plans and supervise the construction work.
The Property Services Agency (PSA), which is an integral part of the
Department of the Environment, is responsible for the construction pro¬
grammes undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed
forces both in Britain and overseas. From 1 April 1988, government depart¬
ments will be able to use agents other than the PSA for civil building projects
costing more than £150,000.
During 1986 a total of 203,400 dwellings were started in Great Britain. Starts in
the public sector were 31,400 and those for private owners 172,000. Some
191,500 dwellings were completed, 33,100 in the public sector and 158,400 in
the private sector.

Construction
The national research and advisory body on all aspects of construction and
building is the Building Research Establishment, which is part of the
Department of the Environment. It has four laboratories, including a fire
research station, and is the site of a building energy management systems
centre.
Research is also carried out by the major construction and materials firms,
universities, colleges of technology and research associations. The research
associations also provide advisory services.
The Building Centre Group consists of five building centres throughout
Britain, most of which provide exhibition and information services on mate¬
rials, products, techniques and building services.
In 1986 British construction companies carried out work overseas worth some
£1,900 million. They won new contracts worth an additional £1,500 million and
at the end of the year the total value of work outstanding stood at £2,300
million. Building material and components companies also exported goods to
the value of £1,500 million. British consulting engineers, process engineers,
architects and surveyors contributed nearly £1,000 million to the nations
invisible earnings. The industry's most important markets in the year were
North America, Asia and Africa.
Major projects involving British companies during the year included the £300
million South Yarra development in Australia, the £288 million Samanalawewa
dam project in Sri Lanka and a £425 million rural water supply project in
Malaysia. Work continued on the Cairo Wastewater project and the Trans Gabon
railway.
The interests of the various sectors of the construction industry overseas are
promoted by the Export Group for the Constructional Industries, the Associa¬
tion of Consulting Engineers, the British Consultants Bureau (whose members
include architects, surveyors and management consultants), the Building
Materials Export Group, the Federation of Manufacturers of Construction
Equipment and Cranes, and the British Water Industries Group.
Service Industries
In 1986 services contributed about 60 per cent of gross domestic product
compared with 45 per cent in 1960 and accounted for 67 per cent of employees
in employment compared with 48 per cent in 1960. Overseas trade in services,
particularly financial services, has also grown, and in 1986 overseas earnings
from services amounted to nearly half the value of exports of manufactures.
Between 1976 and 1980, total service employment rose by 800,000; it then
fell for two years, but recovered again to grow from about 13-4 million in 1982
to 14-2 million in 1986. The net increase over the decade was 1-4 million jobs,
compared with a net decline of nearly 2 million in production industries.
Much of this was accounted for by growth in part-time (principally female)
employment. Since the late 1970s employment has grown more rapidly in the
private sector than in the public sector, a reversal of the pattern of the 1960s
and the early 1970s, partially reflecting the Government's policy of restricting
264

TRADES
employment in public sector services. The fastest-growing sectors in the 1970s,
measured by employment, were leisure and personal services, financial services
and distribution, hotels and catering. In the 1980s the financial services have
continued to grow strongly.
Among the reasons for the growth in services is the fact that as real incomes
rise people tend to spend a greater proportion of income on personal, financial
and leisure services. While, to some extent, consumers have exchanged services
(such as public transport, laundries and cinemas) for goods (motor cars,
washing-machines and television sets), this has generated demand for fresh
services in the distribution, maintenance and repair of these goods. Increased
consumer expenditure on the running costs of motor cars is a significant factor
in the rise in consumer expenditure on services. Demand for British air travel,
hotel and catering services has resulted from the increase in real incomes in
other countries.
Other factors include a greater readiness to use banking services and the
spread of home ownership, which has increased demand for legal and estate
agency services. Demographic changes, such as the increase in the elderly as a
component of the population, help to explain the growth of medical services.
Shorter working hours tend to raise the demand for leisure services.
Changes in technology have also played a part in the growth of services.
Examples range from the computer services industry to the provision of cash
and credit by means of cards and the growth of information systems such as
viewdata and teletext.
A notable trend is a growth in franchising, an operation in which a company
owning the rights to a particular form of trading licenses them to franchisees,
usually by means of an initial payment with continuing royalties. Cleaning
services, film processing, print shops, car rental, engine tuning and servicing,
and fast food retailing have been among the major areas where franchising has
developed.
There were over 4 million people engaged in the distributive and allied trades in
Great Britain in mid-1986, together with a large number of owners of
businesses. There were 900,000 people in wholesaling, just over 2 million in
retailing, 1 million in hotels and catering, and 235,000 in the repair of vehicles
and consumer goods. The distributive and allied trades accounted for about
14 per cent of national income in 1986.
In 1985 there were some 109,800 businesses engaged in wholesaling and
dealing, with a turnover (including sales to other wholesalers and dealers) of
some £171,000 million. The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are
food and drink (turnover £29,000 million in 1985), petroleum products
(£31,300 million) and industrial materials (£20,200 million). The fastest-
growing sectors in 1980—84 were dealing in agricultural commodities and
livestock and in industrial and agricultural machinery.
London’s wholesale markets play a significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main market for fruit and vegetables,
Smithfield for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has its own wholesale organisation, the
Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), to serve the needs of retail societies; its
turnover was £2,375 million in 1986—87. Retail societies are encouraged to buy
from the CWS, which supplies the greater proportion of their requirements.
In the food and drink trade a number of large retailers carry out the functions
of the wholesaler by having their own warehouses and buying and distributive
organisations. Elsewhere in the trade voluntary groups have been formed by
wholesalers with small independent retailers, in which the retailers are

encouraged by discounts and other incentives to buy as much as possible from
the wholesaler. This has helped to preserve many smaller retail outlets for the
wholesaler, including the traditional ‘corner shops' and village stores, of value to
local communities, and has given small retailers the advantages of bulk buying
and co-ordinated distribution.
Turnover of the retail trades has been growing slowly in real terms in recent
years, despite the recession. In 1986 retail sales were 8 per cent higher than in
1985, representing a 5 per cent increase in volume. The indices for value and
volume were 161-7 and 121-0 respectively in 1986 (1980 = 100). In 1984 there
were an estimated 231,000 businesses in the retail trade in Great Britain each
with a turnover of more than £18,700 (see Table 26). Their turnover was about
£82,000 million and they invested £2,100 million. As the large multiple retailers
(those with ten or more outlets) have grown in size and diversified their product
ranges, there has been a decline in the number of retail businesses and outlets.
The decline has been particularly evident among small independent businesses
and retail co-operative societies. Shops selling durable household goods have
experienced the fastest growth in turnover in recent years, while mixed retail
businesses have recorded the slowest growth.
The largest multiple retailers in the packaged grocery market are the retail
eo-operatives, Sainsbury, Tesco, Asda, Dee Corporation, Argyll Stores, Safeway
Food Stores, Fine Fare and Kwik Save Discount Group. Retail co-operative
societies are voluntary organisations controlled by their members, membership
being open to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share; at the end of
1986 the 100 retail societies had over 8 million members and more than 5,200
retail outlets. Turnover in 1986 amounted to in excess of £5,048 million. Retail
co-operatives and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (see above) are members of
the Co-operative Union as are a number of other co-operative bodies such as the
Co-operative Bank. In 1986—87 Sainsbury had about 270 stores and sales were
valued at £4,034 million. Tesco had some 337 outlets and the company’s sales
amounted to £3,807 million.
The leading mixed retail businesses are Marks and Spencer (with sales of
£4,221 million in 1986—87), Boots, F. W. Woolworth, the John Lewis Part¬
nership, House of Fraser, W. H. Smith & Son and the Storehouse Group.
There are a number of discount stores operating on the principle of selling
most or all of their goods at a reduced price. Electrical goods, furniture, carpets
and do-it-yourself supplies are some of the main items sold by discount stores.
About 20 million people regularly shop by post. In 1985 sales by general mail
order firms totalled some £2,950 million, representing 3-4 per cent of retail sales
and 6-6 per cent of retail sales excluding food shops. The volume of mail order
sales increased rapidly in the 1970s but fell off somewhat after 1980. Leading
items sold by mail order are clothing, footwear, furniture, household textiles,
and radio, television and electrical goods.
One of the most significant trends in retailing in recent years has been the
increase in the proportion of turnover accounted for by large multiple retailers;
they have 58 per cent of retail turnover. Other developments include an increase
in very large self-service stores selling a wide variety of products, diversification
by food multiples into selling a wider range of goods, the creation of specially
designed shopping precincts, the growth of shops selling computers, software
and video-cassettes, and an increasing emphasis on price competition.
Supermarkets, There are supermarkets in most towns and cities in Britain. The main multiple
Superstores and grocery companies have been steadily increasing the size of their main
Hypermarkets supermarkets. The trend to greater size has led to a growing number of

superstores and hypermarkets, self-service stores offering a wider range of food
and non-food merchandise and which have at least 2,500 sq m (26,900 sq ft)
and 5,000 sq m (53,800 sq ft) respectively of selling space. They are designed
primarily for shoppers with cars, and substantial free car-parking space is
usually provided. In Britain the first such store was opened in the mid-1960s
and by January 1987 there were some 328 superstores and 47 hypermarkets,
while planning permission for a further 83 superstores and four hypermarkets
had been granted. Government policy on planning and large retail development
was reaffirmed in 1985—86 when local planning authorities were urged to take
account of the trend for new stores to be located outside existing shopping
centres and of the benefits to the public of a wide range of shopping facilities.
Although commercial competition is not a planning consideration, it was
emphasised that authorities will, exceptionally, need to take into account the
effect of the trend on the vitality and viability of established town centres. Since
January 1987 local planning authorities have been required to consult the
Department of the Environment before granting permission for retail develop¬
ments of 250,000 sq ft (23,325 sq m) or more.
Shopping
Centres
Britain has a variety of new purpose-built shopping centres. The largest are the
Manchester Arndale, the Metro-Centre in Tyneside and the centre in Milton
Keynes, which cover more than 93,000 sq m (1 million sq ft) and are among the
largest in Europe. Other large centres are at Town Square, Basildon, the Eldon
Square Development in Newcastle upon Tyne, Brent Cross in London, the
Mander Centre in Wolverhampton and the Luton Arndale.

Many of the large multiple groups have diversified over the last few years to offer
a much bigger range of goods and services than previously. This has been
especially noticeable for the large food retailers, which often sell non-food
products, such as beer, wines and spirits, clothing and household appliances,
as well as packaged groceries. Another trend is that many superstores and large
supermarkets offer fresh as well as packaged food, often with special counters or
areas for fresh meat, fish, vegetables and bread baked on the premises. Some
large retailers have in recent years begun to provide financial and estate agency
services.
Retailers are placing greater emphasis both on price competition and quality as
a means of promoting sales. With the growth of payments by credit card, certain
of the large retailers have issued their own credit cards for regular customers in
an attempt to increase sales, particularly of high-value goods.
Laser-scanning electronic check-outs are already having a major impact on
retailing in Britain. Substantial savings are expected from improved stock
control and a reduction of individual price marking in stores. Key Markets
introduced the first operational laser-scanning electronic check-out in Britain at
Spalding (Lincolnshire) in 1979. Computerised shopping services are being
introduced in the home which enable people to order goods from retailers. Some
large multiple retailers are using electronic order and invoice systems in dealing
with their suppliers, following a legal change permitting tax invoices in forms
other than paper. Small independent retailers, also, are using electronic
ordering, pricing and delivery systems. High-speed labelling techniques are
being adopted, including the use of electronic printers which can overprint
labels, the use of pressure-sensitive glues and printing in foil instead of ink.
A single nationwide ‘electronic funds transfer at the point of sale’ (EFTPOS)
system is to be established for the retail market in co-operation with the English
and Scottish clearing banks. The system will use magnetically striped cards and
terminals installed in retail premises to transfer funds directly from card¬
holders' accounts to the retailers' accounts. Various pilot projects are already in
operation and a large-scale system with 2,000 terminals—in Leeds, South¬
ampton and Edinburgh—is planned for the end of 1988.
In June 1986 some 233,000 people were employed in Great Britain in the retail
distribution of motor vehicles and parts and in petrol stations. In spite of the
continuing increase in the number of road vehicles, the number of petrol
stations is declining and at the end of 1986 there were some 20,641 (2-4 per cent
fewer than in 1985), of which 31-3 per cent were owned by oil companies. There
were about 11,746 outlets selling diesel fuel. Self-service stations are becoming
increasingly important and in 1986 they accounted for 42-4 per cent of petrol
stations. Some 200,000 people were employed in the repair of motor vehicles in
1986.
The hotel and catering trades employed 1 million people in Great Britain in
mid-1985: 256,000 in hotels and other residential establishments; 226,000 in
restaurants, cafes and snack bars; 268,000 in public houses and bars; 143,000
in clubs; and 136,000 in canteens. A large number of self-employed people are
also engaged in hotels and catering. There were 12,800 hotel businesses in
Great Britain in 1985, with a turnover of £4,050 million. Many licensed hotels
as well as most of the numerous guest houses are small, with fewer than 20
rooms. Of the major hotel business groups the biggest is Trusthouse Forte Ltd,
which runs 800 hotels including 200 in Britain, and has catering and leisure
interests. The total turnover of holiday camps and camping and caravan sites

was about £500 million in 1985. Among the largest firms running holiday
centres (including holiday camps with full board, self-catering centres and
caravan parks) are Butlins, Pontins, Ladbroke Holidays, Warners and Haven
Leisure. There were over 41,600 businesses in Great Britain in 1985 with a total
turnover of more than £4,250 million, which were engaged in the sale of food for
consumption both on and off the premises. These include restaurants, snack
bars, cafes, fish and chip shops and other establishments selling ‘take-away’
food. Britain has a very wide range of restaurants of which a substantial number
specialise in Chinese, Italian, Indian and Greek foods. ‘Fast-food’ catering, in
which establishments sell hot food such as hamburgers or chicken to be eaten
either on the premises or elsewhere, is becoming increasingly significant. There
are about 42,300 ‘pubs’ (public houses, which mainly sell beer, wines and spirits
for consumption on the premises) in Great Britain, with a total turnover of
£7,336 million in 1985.
Business services include advertising, market research, management consul¬
tancy, exhibition and conference facilities, computer services and auction
houses. Most of these sectors have grown rapidly in recent years.
Advertising expenditure rose by 15-2 per cent in 1986 to £5,117 million, with
that going to television increasing by 21 - 7 per cent, according to the Advertising
Association. Advertising in the press accounted for 60 per cent of the total,
television for 34 per cent, posters for 4 per cent and commercial radio and
cinema for the rest. Advertising has been growing fastest in the free distribution
press and directories. Advertising campaigns are planned mainly by advertising
agencies, of which there are several hundred in Britain; in some cases they also
provide marketing, consumer research and other services.
The industry comprises software houses, which provide professional services
such as consultancy, the writing of programs to meet the computing needs of
their clients, and, increasingly, packaged software designed for a wider market;
computer bureaux, where the main emphasis is on processing customers’ data;
and systems houses, which specialise in the provision of complete systems
(hardware and software).
The computing services industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
British economy: annual growth averaged 18 per cent between 1978 and 1986
and the turnover of the British market was approximately £2,100 million in
1986. The industry employs about 45,000 people, excluding those working on
computer maintenance and on ‘in-house’ computer activities, who number
several hundred thousand. Many of the computing service companies are
subsidiaries of firms engaged in activities such as banking, insurance,
manufacturing and distribution.
There are thought to be some 7,000 management consultants in Britain, of
whom 3,000 are practising members of the Institute of Management Consul¬
tants. Among the largest management consultancy companies are the 29
members of the Management Consultancies Association, whose turnover
amounted to £228 million in 1986. Revenue earned within Britain comprised
£201 million, an increase of 42 per cent on the previous year, while overseas
revenue amounted to £27 million. The Association reports a growing demand
for services supporting the application of information technology, particularly
micro-processing, to all aspects of business.
The 30 members of the Association of Market Survey Organisations (AMSO)
accounted for about 75 per cent of total turnover by market research companies

in 1986. The turnover of AMSO members increased to £152 million from £136
million in 1985. The largest company, the AGB group, had a turnover of £31-7
million. Research on behalf of food and soft drinks companies accounted for
20 per cent of revenue. Research on behalf of financial institutions and groups
with international interests has increased.
With the steady increase in new and renovated facilities, some 80 towns and
cities are well equipped to hold conferences and exhibitions. Among the most
modern facilities are the National Exhibition Centre at Birmingham, the
Wembley Conference Centre, the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre and the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in London, the Brighton Centre in
Sussex, the Harrogate Centre in North Yorkshire, the Bournemouth Interna¬
tional Centre in Dorset, St David's Hall in Cardiff, the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre in Glasgow, the G-MEX Centre in Manchester, the Royal
Centre in Nottingham, the English Riviera Centre in Torquay, the Corn
Exchange in Cambridge and the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre.
Other large facilities are the Earls Court, Olympia and Wembley Arena sites in
London. Britain is one of the world's three leading countries for international
conferences (the others being the United States and France); the Union of
International Associations, based in Brussels, estimated that about 9 per cent of
the world’s main international conferences were held in Britain in 1985. The
value of domestic and international conference business in Britain is estimated
at £750 million for 1985.
Britain's chief auction houses are active in the international auction markets for
works of art, trading on the acknowledged expertise of British valuers and
dealers. The two largest houses, Sotheby's and Christie’s, are established
world-wide and had turnovers of £854 million and £403 million in 1986-87
respectively.
Some 117,000 people were employed in film, theatre, literary, musical,
broadcasting and related services in Great Britain in mid-1986, 359,000 in
sanitary services, 110,000 in research and development services and 311,000 in
services connected with sport, recreation, gambling and betting. Other services
provided included hairdressing and beauty parlours (113,000 employees),
laundries, dyers and dry cleaners (65,900), photographic studios, religious
organisations, tourist offices, learned societies, employers' and trade union
organisations, and funeral services.
Recent years have seen further development of the independent programme
production sector, and of specialised film and television services. New technical
developments include origination on professional standard video as opposed to
film, and an increasing use of computer-generated graphics and picture
manipulation in both production and post-production work. Production of films
for cinema (an activity particularly cyclical in nature) declined in the mid-1980s.
The Department of Trade and Industry conducts an annual inquiry into the
value of overseas transactions relating to the production and exhibition of
cinema and television material. For many years the inquiry has shown a surplus
of receipts over expenditure. In 1985 receipts by film and television companies
were £370 million, while expenditure was £206 million, a surplus of £164
million. Film companies' receipts totalled £260 million and television com¬
panies' receipts £110 million, the North American market accounting for about
three-fifths of revenue in both cases. Some 316 film companies and 18 television
broadcasting companies were covered in the 1985 inquiry.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TOURISM
AND
TRAVEL
Tourism is one of Britain’s most important industries and is recognised as a
major and growing source of employment. Spending by British residents and
overseas visitors on tourism in Britain during 1986 amounted to around
£12,000 million (excluding fares paid on travel to and from Britain). It is
estimated that about 1-3 million jobs in Britain were supported directly or
indirectly by tourism spending in 1986. The British Tourist Authority forecasts
that around 200,000 new jobs will be created in the period 1987-92.
In 1986, 13-8 million overseas visitors to Britain (4 per cent less than in 1985,
which was a record year) spent £5,457 million, virtually the same as in the
previous year. British residents made 24-9 million trips abroad and spent
£5,966 million, giving a deficit on the travel account of £539 million. About 60
per cent of overseas visitors to Britain came from Western Europe, 21 per cent
from North America and about 19 per cent from elsewhere in the world. There
was a 14 per cent increase in visits abroad by British residents in 1986; the
majority of visits (88 per cent) were to Western Europe.
Some 2,850 travel agencies, with about 6,590 offices (over 90 per cent of the
total), belong to the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA). In general travel
agents are small businesses but many ABTA members have more than one
office. There are a few large firms (of which the biggest is Thomas Cook with over
335 branches). Computerised information and booking systems are being
introduced in travel agencies. There are also 550 tour operator members of
ABTA; some 250 companies are both retail agents and tour operators. ABTA
operates financial protection schemes to safeguard its members’ customers,
maintains codes of conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair Trading, and offers
a free conciliation service to help to resolve complaints against members and an
independent arbitration scheme for tour operators’ customers.
Official support for the promotion of tourism to and within Britain is provided
by the British Tourist Authority and the tourist boards for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Funding for the tourist boards has been further
increased for 1987—88 and the boards have been asked by the Government to
encourage tourism in regions of the country where unemployment is high and
where there is potential for development. Voluntary registration schemes exist
for tourist accommodation throughout Britain and facilities offered by regis¬
tered establishments are listed in the boards' accommodation guides. At the
beginning of 1987 the boards for England, Scotland and Wales introduced a
one- to five-crown classification scheme for hotels and other serviced accom¬
modation, based on facilities offered, and a quality grading scheme for caravan,
chalet and camping parks. Information on tourist facilities and accommodation
is available from official information centres throughout Britain (most of which
are administered by local authorities) and on videotex information services in
Britain and overseas.

Energy Policy
Energy
and Natural
Resources
Energy and non-fuel minerals make an important contribution to the British
economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in 1985 was £27,498
million representing about 9 per cent of gross domestic product, of which crude
oil accounted for 71 per cent, coal 14 per cent and natural gas 7 per cent.
All minerals in Great Britain are privately owned, with the exception of gold,
silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned by the Crown), and coal and some
minerals associated with coal. In Northern Ireland gold and silver are owned by
the Crown, while rights to petroleum and other minerals are vested in the
Government. On the United Kingdom Continental Shelf the right to exploit all
minerals except coal is vested in the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal,
or license others to do so, both on land and under the sea, is vested in the British
Coal Corporation. Normally, ownership of minerals belongs to the owner of the
land surface but in some areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these
rights have become separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coalmining,
are usually carried out by privately owned companies.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Energy
Britain has the largest energy resources of any country in the European
Community and is a major world producer of oil, natural gas and coal. The other
main primary sources are nuclear power and some water power; secondary
sources are electricity, coke and very small quantities of town gas. Since 1980
Britain has been self-sufficient in energy in net terms as a result of the
continued growth in offshore oil production, and self-sufficiency should be
maintained for a number of years. Coal is the country’s richest natural resource
and is expected to maintain its role in meeting the country’s energy needs. A
major capital investment programme in the coal industry is in progress. Nuclear
power provided about 20 per cent of electricity available from the British public
supply system in 1986, and this proportion is expected to increase.
Privately owned companies predominate in offshore oil and gas production
and oil refining, while publicly owned bodies are responsible for most coal
production and electricity generation and distribution. In Great Britain the
Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for these industries, except for
electricity in Scotland which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is responsible for all energy
matters there.
The Government’s energy policy is designed to ensure the secure, adequate and
economic provision of energy to meet Britain's requirements. The Government

seeks to ensure that all economic forms of energy are produced, supplied and
used as efficiently as possible, having regard also to the international
application of the technologies involved. Oil and gas resources continue to be
developed profitably. The Government attaches importance to the development
of a competitive coal industry and to the safe and economic development of
nuclear power. Particular attention is paid to achieving the most cost-effective
use of energy through the adoption of energy efficiency measures.
Britain is actively engaged in international collaboration on energy questions,
notably through its membership of the European Community and of the
International Energy Agency (IEA, a body with 21 member countries attached to
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Since its
establishment in 1974, the IEA has agreed a wide range of co-operative
measures to reduce member nations’ dependence on imported oil, and it
continues to support the adoption of realistic energy pricing policies by all
member countries, both to discourage wasteful use of energy and to stimulate
new methods of utilising and saving it.
Inland primary energy consumption amounted to 335-2 million tonnes of coal
equivalent in 1986 (see Table 27), 2-5 per cent more than in 1985. Energy
consumption by final users in 1986 amounted to 57,860 million therms1 on a
‘heat supplied’ basis, of which domestic users consumed about 30 per cent,
industrial users 28 per cent, transport 28 per cent, and commerce, agriculture
and public services 14 per cent.

Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
The aim of obtaining the best value for money from energy consumed is an
integral part of the Government’s strategy to increase the efficiency with which
energy is supplied and used throughout the economy. Studies have indicated
that the potential for improvements in Britain's energy use resulting from
cost-effective energy efficiency measures is at least 20 per cent, worth some
£7,000 million a year. In 1983 the Government launched a campaign, led by the
Energy Efficiency Office, aimed at achieving that improvement. The Office
administers a wide range of schemes, publicity, advice and targeted assistance
to highlight the means and financial benefits of using energy more efficiently,
and 1986 was designated Energy Efficiency Year, to reinforce these programmes

and initiatives. During the year, nearly 2,000 events were held throughout the
country, some two-thirds of which were sponsored from outside government—
by the fuel supply industries, the energy efficiency industries and other sectors
with energy interests.
During 1986 the number of senior executives from industry, commerce and
local government who had attended the Office’s briefings reached 20,000. There
are now about 10,000 energy managers in 77 groups nationwide who are
responsible for promoting the benefits of improved energy efficiency, monitoring
their companies’ and local authorities’ energy consumption and passing on
information about the latest developments in energy management.
This programme also includes financial assistance towards the cost of energy
efficiency surveys in industry and commerce. The Office is supporting the
development of monitoring and targeting systems among non-domestic energy
users, with the aim of having systems on 1,000 sites by the end of 1990.
Financial assistance is available towards selected energy efficiency demonstra¬
tion projects which utilise new technologies or new applications of existing
technologies; it is also available for selected research and development projects
that help develop new or improved energy efficiency products, processes or
systems. Regional energy efficiency officers provide help to companies and
support for energy managers.
The Energy Efficiency Office has contributed to the cost of schemes in
Edinburgh, Belfast and Leicester which have been exploring the technical and
economic prospects of combined heat and power—the use of waste heat
generated in producing electricity to provide hot water and steam.
To ensure that the campaign’s momentum was maintained after 1986, the
Government embarked upon an action programme to achieve further progress
with energy efficiency schemes and initiatives in 1987 and beyond.
GAS Britain’s energy position has been transformed by the discovery of substantial
oil and gas reserves offshore in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS).
The total area covered by production licences is some 100,000 sq km (39,000
sq miles) out of a total designated area of about 651,650 sq km (251,600
sq miles), over which Britain has exercised its rights to explore and exploit the
seabed and subsoil. Expenditure on offshore and onshore exploration and
development amounted to some £3,356 million in 1986. By the end of 1986,
3,062 wells had been or were being drilled in the UKCS (1,385 development
wells, 1,109 exploration wells and 568 appraisal wells).
The Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy is responsible for
ensuring that British industry has a full and fair opportunity in the supply of
goods and services to the UKCS; for supporting British firms’ research and
development projects for new products and techniques for use in oil and gas
exploration; and for promoting Britain’s offshore interests overseas. Britain’s
offshore supplies industry is the second largest in the world (after that of the
United States). In 1986 goods and services valued at £2,231 million were
ordered for UKCS developments, the British share of orders received being
£1,834 million (82 per cent).
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly dependent for its oil supplies on
imports, the only indigenous supplies coming from a small number of
land-based oilfields. However, the first notable discovery of oil in the UKCS was
made in 1969 and the first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Output of crude oil
from the UKCS in 1986 averaged 2-5 million barrels (332,000 tonnes) a day,
making Britain the world's sixth largest producer.

There were 32 offshore fields producing crude oil at the end of 1986, while seven
more fields are under development. The largest producing fields are Brent and
Forties; other significant finds may prove to have commercial potential after
further appraisal. Production from most large fields is controlled from produc¬
tion platforms of either steel or concrete which have been built to withstand
severe weather including gusts of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and waves
of 30 m (100 ft).
Primary oil production, including condensates and petroleum gases,
amounted to about 127 million tonnes in 1986 (see Table 28). Output is around
its maximum, and production is forecast to decline slowly in the rest of the
1980s. Britain should remain a significant producer well into the 1990s and, on
a smaller scale, into the twenty-first century. The Government’s oil policy is
intended to encourage exploration and development with the objective of
maximising economic oil production for the foreseeable future. Remaining
proven reserves of oil in the UKCS amount to between 710 and 2,050 million
tonnes while the total remaining reserves of the UKCS could be as high as 4,438
million tonnes. The Petroleum Act 1987 empowers the Secretary of State for
Energy to require those responsible to draw up programmes for the abandon¬
ment of offshore installations when the first fields cease production in the early
1990s.
There are several large oil companies operating in Britain or engaged in work in
the UKCS. In total there are about 280 companies with interests in the North
Sea. The two leading British oil companies are British Petroleum (BP) and Shell
Transport and Trading, which are the two largest industrial companies in
Britain in terms of turnover. The exploration and development of the UKCS is
carried out by the private sector. The only state involvement is a small Oil and
Pipelines Agency which in 1985 took over the residual functions of the British
National Oil Corporation, which had been abolished. The Agency markets the
crude oil received by the Government as petroleum royalty taken in kind,
manages the Government’s pipeline and storage system and holds the Govern¬
ment’s rights under participation agreements with the oil companies.
Onshore production of crude oil is much less significant than offshore
production. In 1986 it amounted to 504,000 tonnes, about 55 per cent of which
came from Britain's largest onshore field at Wytch Farm (Dorset), which started
production in 1979. In addition to minor production from various mining
licensees, there are five other onshore fields, including Humbly Grove (Hamp¬
shire) and Welton (Lincolnshire); Stainton in Lincolnshire is under develop¬
ment. At the end of 1986, 101 new exploration licences were in force.
At the beginning of 1987 the distillation capacity of Britain’s 14 oil refineries
stood at 90 million tonnes a year. Excess capacity is being eliminated, while
existing refineries are being adapted to the changing pattern of demand by the
construction of new upgrading facilities (‘catalytic crackers’) which are leading
to a higher output of motor spirit and naphtha at the expense of fuel oil.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1986 totalled some 69 million tonnes, including 21-5 million
tonnes of motor spirit, 7 -5 million tonnes of kerosene, 171 million tonnes of gas
and diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road vehicles) and 12-5 million tonnes
of fuel oil.
Exports of crude oil amounted to 82-1 million tonnes in 1986. Virtually all
exports went to Britain's partners in the European Community and the IEA, the
largest markets being the Netherlands, France, the Federal Republic of Germany

and the United States. Some 20-2 million tonnes of petroleum products were
also exported. Though self-sufficient, Britain continues to import other crude
oils, to enable the full range of petroleum products to be made efficiently and
economically. The main sources of imports in 1986 were Norway (which
supplied about 39 per cent by value), Saudi Arabia (11 per cent), Egypt (10 per
cent) and Nigeria (8-5 per cent).

a Crude oil plus condensates and petroleum gases derived at onshore treatment plants.
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 80 per cent of offshore oil in 1986. Some
1,660 km (1,031 miles) of major submarine pipeline brings oil ashore from the
North Sea oilfields (see map, p 274). Major crude oil onshore pipelines in
operation from harbours, land terminals or offshore moorings to refineries
include those connecting Finnart to Grangemouth, Tranmere to Stanlow,
Amlwch to Stanlow, and Cruden Bay to Grangemouth. Onshore pipelines also
carry refined products to major marketing areas; for example, a 423-km
(263-mile) pipeline runs from Milford Haven to the midlands and Manchester.
The leading oil companies have extensive research and development pro¬
grammes in support of oil exploration and production and on new and improved
fuels. All aspects of production are covered, including the design of production
facilities and enhanced oil recovery techniques. Research centres are at
Sunbuiy-on-Thames (BP), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Sittingbourne in
Kent (Shell), and Abingdon in Oxfordshire (Esso). The main government
research and development effort in offshore technology is undertaken by the
Department of Energy with the advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board.
In 1986—87 the Department spent some £24 million in support of offshore
technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in central London. For many years gas was produced from coal but

switch to producing town gas from oil-based feedstocks. In the late 1960s,
following the first commercial natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965 and
the start of offshore gas production in 1967, supplies of offshore natural gas
grew rapidly and by 1977 natural gas had replaced town gas in the public supply
system in Great Britain.
Under the Gas Act 1986, the gas industry in Great Britain, in state ownership
since 1949, was privatised and the assets of the British Gas Corporation
transferred to the new company, British Gas pic. The Act also established the
Office of Gas Supply, to monitor British Gas’s activities as a public gas supplier,
and the Gas Consumers Council, to look after the interests of consumers.
British Gas has about 3 million shareholders. The Government holds
approximately 3-5 per cent of the shares, which have been set aside for the share
bonus for private shareholders who retain shares for three years. In 1986—87 the
turnover of British Gas and its subsidiary companies amounted to £7,610
million, of which gas supply accounted for £6,967 million. Current cost
operating profit was £1,005 million. It has recently made much investment,
especially in the Rough and South Morecambe fields (see below). British Gas has
some 86,000 employees.
In 1986 indigenous natural gas accounted for about 76-5 per cent of total
natural gas supplies, the remainder coming from Norway. Production of natural
gas, excluding that flared or vented at terminals or fields, amounted to 45,310
million cubic metres, of which 3,496 million cubic metres were used for drilling,
production and pumping operations offshore.
Net production (chiefly sales to British Gas) amounted to 41,814 million cubic
metres. It comes mainly from seven major gasfields: Leman, Frigg (UK),
Indefatigable, Viking, Hewett, West Sole and Victor. In addition, gas from the
South Morecambe field in the Irish Sea and from the twin Sean North and Sean
South fields, inaugurated in 1986, is used to augment supplies to meet peak
demand in winter.
During 1986 the Secretary of State approved five new developments: Cleeton,
Ravenspurn South and the South Valiant, Vanguard and Vulcan fields. Early in
1987 approval was also given for the development of the Audrey gasfield off the
Lincolnshire coast, due to begin production in 1988.
Remaining recoverable gas reserves, including possible gas from existing
discoveries and potential future discoveries, are in the range of 890,000 million
to 2-836 million million cubic metres. Indigenous offshore natural gas reserves
are likely to meet most of the British market demand well into the 1990s.
The British Gas national high-pressure pipeline system of some 5,900 km
(3,900 miles) provides for the distribution of natural gas. It is supplied by feeder
mains from four North Sea shore terminals, and from a terminal in Barrow-in-
Furness (Cumbria). The whole of the high-pressure transmission system is
regularly inspected.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
used including salt cavities and storage facilities for liquefied natural gas.
British Gas has also developed the partially depleted Rough field as a major gas
store. This, the first such use of an offshore field, involves the injection into the
Rough reservoir in the summer months of gas drawn from the national
transmission system for recovery at high rates during periods of peak winter
demand.
Sales of gas by the supply industry in Britain totalled 18,741 million therms in
1986, 1-9 percent more than in 1985. About half of all gas sold by British Gas to

its 17 million consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, the
remainder being for household use. Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the
pottery industry and certain processes for making iron and steel products. In
1986, 5,242 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 197 million
therms to fuel producers and 2,950 million therms to commercial and other
non-domestic users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters,
water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic
demand is for gas for central heating. In 1986, 10,352 million therms were sold
to domestic users.
British Gas spends some £74 million a year on its research and development
programme, carried out at five research stations throughout Britain. It has a
joint research agreement with Japan and has carried out research for United
States companies. The programme is investigating mechanical engineering
design, materials technology, the instrumentation and electronics related to gas
transmission, storage and offshore operations. Other areas being studied are
improved industrial applications of gas, with major energy savings and
sophisticated automatic control of processes; domestic and commercial utilisa¬
tion; and the development of substitute natural gas from coal and oil. A major
development is the ‘intelligent pig’, among the most advanced inspection
vehicles for examining gas and oil pipelines in use.
An international consultancy service makes available advanced technological
processes under licence; carries out audits of every aspect of the industry; and
provides computer software and training.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 292 million tonnes
of coal, exported 74-2 million tonnes and employed over a million workers. In
1947 the coal-mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry
Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as a statutory
corporation to manage the industry. In 1987 the Board’s name was changed to
the British Coal Corporation.
British Coal has, with limited exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. It also has powers to work other minerals, where
discoveries are made in the course of searching for, or working, coal; and to
engage in certain petrochemicals activities beneficial to the future of the coal
industry. Retail sales remain largely in private hands, although British Coal
makes bulk sales to large industrial consumers.
At the end of March 1987 there were 108 British Coal collieries in operation.
The main coal-bearing regions are shown on the map on p 280.
In 1986-87 total output of 106-9 million tonnes comprised 88-7 million tonnes
of deep-mined coal, 14-6 million tonnes from opencast mines and 3-6 million
tonnes from other sources (including licensed collieries and tip coal).
Britain’s coal industry is one of the largest in Western Europe, and one of
the world's most technologically advanced. British Coal has a substantial capital
investment programme, which amounted to £644 million in 1986—87. Techni¬
cal progress has been concentrated on equipment capable of obtaining higher
output from fewer faces. Microprocessor control systems hqve been introduced

and shield supports have been made available in all but the thinnest seam
sections. New designs of power loader and face conveyor are being brought in
whenever they are cost-effective. Production at the new mining complex at Selby
in North Yorkshire (one of the world’s most advanced deep mines) is planned to
build up to 10 million tonnes a year. Investment of £400 million has been
allocated to develop a new mine at Asfordby within the Vale of Belvoir
(Leicestershire); the Vale contains recoverable reserves estimated at 510 million
tonnes.
The first coal to be discovered on a significant scale in Northern Ireland is a
substantial deposit of lignite (brown coal) on the eastern shore of Lough Neagh
and under the lake bed. Further deposits have been discovered and are being
appraised to determine their size and the feasibility of mining.
In 1986—87 inland consumption of coal was 1131 million tonnes of which 70
per cent was by power stations, 10 per cent by coke ovens and 7 per cent by
domestic users. With a substantial proportion of coal being used by power
stations for electricity generation, British Coal sales of coal to them totalled 79-5
million tonnes in 1986—87. Exports of coal in 1986—87 were 2-3 million tonnes,
while imports amounted to some 10 million tonnes.
In 1986-87 British Coal spent £48 million on research. It has two main research
establishments: the Technical Department at Stanhope Bretby (Staffordshire),
for work on mining methods and equipment and developing systems for remote
and automatic control; and the Coal Research Establishment at Stoke Orchard
(near Cheltenham), concerned with the utilisation of coal, including research
and development on combustion techniques for industrial steam-raising and
heating. This project has led to successful commercial exploitation, and
development work continues. Agreements to exchange technical information
have been signed by British Coal with several countries. Britain is responsible
through a British Coal subsidiary for the management of a service which
provides information on and analyses of coal topics under the auspices of the
International Energy Agency.
The first public supply of electricity in the world was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in. the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and 1957)
effected a measure of decentralisation and established the present structure of
public corporations. Electricity from the public supply system is available to all
premises in Britain except for some very remote rural households. The public
supply industry employed over 150,000 people and invested some £1,670
million in 1986-87. The main transmission system (national grid) in Great
Britain is one of the largest fully interconnected power networks in the Western
world.
The Energy Act 1983 allows private generation to compete with the public
supply industry. It entitles private generators of electricity to sell their electricity
to the boards on terms reflecting costs fairly incurred by the boards, and allows
them to use the public transmission and distribution system.
The Electricity Council is the central co-ordinating body of the supply industry
in England and Wales. It has a general responsibility for promoting the
development and maintenance of an efficient, co-ordinated and economical
system of electricity supply. Electricity is generated and transmitted by the

electricity boards are responsible for distribution and for the retail sale of
electricity. In 1986—87 the income of the electricity supply industry in England
and Wales was £11,119 million.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separating
their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth
of Tay (see map, opposite). In 1986—87 the turnover of the SSEB and the NSHEB
was £906 million and £324 million respectively.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried out
by Northern Ireland Electricity, a publicly owned body.
Sales of electricity in 1986 amounted to 247,895 gigawatt hours (GWh).
Domestic users took 37 per cent of the total, industry 35 per cent and
commercial and other users the remainder. About one-fifth of domestic sales is
for space heating, one-sixth for water heating and one-tenth for cooking.
Electricity is used in industry mainly for motive power, melting, heating and
lighting. It is supplied to 24-5 million consumers of whom 21-7 million are in
England and Wales, 1-7 million are supplied by the SSEB, 584,000 by the

consumed 116-2 million tonnes of coal equivalent in 1986, of which coal
accounted for 71 per cent and oil 9 per cent. The output capacity of the 172
generating stations of the electricity boards at the end of 1986 totalled 62,885
megawatts (MW) including 52,363 MW run by the CEGB, 6,160 MW by the
SSEB, 2,570 MW by the NSHEB and 1,726 MW by Northern Ireland Electricity.
An analysis of electricity generation by and output capacity of the public supply
system is given in Table 29.

Nuclear Power
Nuclear Power
Development
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
(18,816 GWh in 1986). The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemicals, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and
British Nuclear Fuels pic. In 1986 these nuclear plants supplied 4,289 GWh of
electricity to the public supply system.
The most recent large-scale power stations are based on units of 500 MW and
660 MW. Station capacities have increased and there are 15 stations each with a
capacity of 2,000 MW or more including Kingsnorth (Kent), Europe’s largest
mixed-fuel station burning either coal or oil. The Drax coal-fired station (North
Yorkshire), which has an output capacity of 4,000 MW, is the largest coal-fired
station in Western Europe. The larger units have a higher thermal efficiency (the
ratio of the net electrical energy output to the heat energy input) than earlier
units, and their introduction, coupled with the closure of less efficient plant,
has resulted in a gradual rise in overall thermal efficiency, leading to substantial
savings in fuel consumption. Average thermal efficiency of conventional steam
stations in England and Wales rose from 20-91 per cent in 1947-48 to 35-08 per
cent in 1986—87. The Government is considering proposals for a lignite-fuelled
power station in Northern Ireland, to come into use in the mid-1990s.
The pumped-storage station at Dinorwig (Gwynedd), the largest of its type in
Europe, has an average generated output of 1,728 MW. (In pumped-storage
schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to
high-level reservoirs from which it descends to drive turbines, rapidly providing
a large supply of electricity at peak periods or to meet sudden increases in
demand.)
The CEGB, together with Electricite de France, has constructed a 2,000-MW
cross-Channel cable link, which started to operate in 1986, increasing the
capacity for the transmission of electricity between the two countries.
The Government is keen to encourage combined heat and power (CHP)
schemes. As part of a programme to study the potential for CHP/district heating
in particular locations in Britain, the Government has given financial assistance
to consortia from Belfast, Edinburgh and Leicester for the preparation of a
prospectus for a combined CHP/district heating scheme. It is expected that all of
these studies will be completed by the end of 1987.
Britain has been developing nuclear power for several decades and in 1956 the
world’s first industrial-scale nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria),
began to supply electricity to the national grid. The Government believes that
nuclear power has a vital role in helping to meet Britain’s long-term energy
requirements. There are 14 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by
the CEGB, while four other stations also feed electricity to the national grid: the
two original Magnox stations (both with a net capacity of about 200 MW)
operated by British Nuclear Fuels pic at Calder Hall and Chapelcross (Dumfries
and Galloway); and two prototype stations run by the UKAEA—at Winfrith
(Dorset) and a prototype fast reactor at Dounreay (Highland).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total gross
capacity of about 4,000 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971, the
largest being Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a capacity of 840 MW. The second
series of orders was based on the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR). Hinkley
Point B (Somerset) and Hunterston B (Strathclyde) began operating in 1976,
while three more AGRs began operating in 1984: Dungeness B (Kent),
Hartlepool (Cleveland) and Heysham (Lancashire). All the AGRs are 1,320-MW
units except Dungeness B (1,200 MW). Construction is in progress on two
further 1,320-MW AGRs—a second station at Heysham and a station at Torness

(Lothian)—and these should be completed by 1988. In March 1987 the Secretary
of State for Energy, following a public inquiry, granted consent for the CEGB to
build a pressurised water reactor at Sizewell (Suffolk) for which the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate issued a safety licence in June 1987.
British Nuclear Fuels pic provides nuclear fuel services covering the whole fuel
cycle: uranium conversion, uranium enrichment (through its shareholding in
Urenco Ltd), fuel element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel,
and the manufacture of specialised fuel element components. All of its shares
are held by the Government. The company is organised into four divisions,
covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire): fuel manufac¬
ture at Springfields (Lancashire): reprocessing (operations) at Sellafield (Cum¬
bria) where valuable unused uranium and plutonium are recovered from the
spent fuel; and reprocessing (engineering) at the headquarters at Risley
(Cheshire). There is a large-scale investment programme in progress involving
expenditure of some £3,600 million over the next ten years. The major part of
this expenditure relates to the Sellafield site and comprises the refurbishment of
facilities for treating spent fuel from Magnox power stations, the construction of
a thermal oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) which will take spent fuel from
Britain’s AGRs and overseas reactors, and the construction of facilities to
process and package radioactive waste. The remainder of the programme
involves the construction of further centrifuge enrichment plant at Capenhurst,
and refurbishment and construction of new plant at Springfields.
The UKAEA carries out research and development to ensure that nuclear power
is economic, safe and environmentally acceptable. Its work is undertaken by
research establishments at Harwell (Oxfordshire), Risley, Winfrith, Springfields,
Windscale (Cumbria), Dounreay and Culham (Oxfordshire). In addition, safety
research is carried out at the Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth
(Cheshire). Work connected with the development of the fast reactor and its fuel
cycle takes place principally at Dounreay and represents a major programme for
the UKAEA.
The UKAEA operates as a trading fund, which allows it to function on a
commercial basis. Under these arrangements the UKAEA’s research and
development work funded by the Department of Energy is on a customer-
contractor basis. The UKAEA also carries out work for a number of other
customers including the electricity generating boards, British Nuclear Fuels pic,
other government departments and industry.
Co-operation on nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements—such as that with
Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy setting out
collaboration on the development of the fast reactor—and membership of bodies
such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, and through direct links on
research between the UKAEA and equivalent organisations overseas.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), including one on establishing the
feasibility of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion. A major component of
this programme is the Joint European Torus (JET) project at Culham, which
started operating in 1983.
The Government and the nuclear industry give high priority to safety and the
industry has an excellent safety record. Responsibility for safety at nuclear sites
rests with the operators who must protect their workers and the public by
complying with the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, with conditions of
their nuclear site licences under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and by
286

keeping discharges within the limits and conditions set by authorisations
granted under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960. In England authorisations
are granted jointly by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and in Scotland and Wales by their
respective Secretaries of State. The terms of the authorisations are designed to
ensure that those most exposed to the effects of discharges receive less than the
maximum dose limit recommended by the International Commission on
Radiological Protection. Within the limits, operators of nuclear facilities are
required to keep discharges as low as reasonably achievable and failure to do so
makes them liable to prosecution. Compliance with the legislation is overseen by
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive, by the
Inspectorate of Pollution (set up in 1987) in England and Wales, and by the
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland.
Britain is playing a major part in international discussions on nuclear safety.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has drawn up an outline programme
which would include the establishment of two international conventions: one on
the reporting and exchange of information on nuclear accidents with possible
transboundary effects, and one on co-ordinated emergency response and
assistance in the event of such an accident.
The Electricity Council draws up a general programme of research, some of it
direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards and some of it in
co-operation with selected industrial research associations and through re¬
search contracts placed with universities and other organisations. Some of the
work is done in collaboration with the two Scottish electricity boards and
Northern Ireland Electricity which contribute towards its cost (£186 million in
1986—87). Collaboration on research between the supply industry and the plant
manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering Research Steering
Committee. The research establishments run by the CEGB comprise the Central
Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the Berkeley Nuclear
Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood Engineering Laboratories
on Southampton Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity
utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at
Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
The Department of Energy is supporting research and development in the
renewable energy technologies, to encourage the use of those which have been
shown to be commercially attractive, and to increase understanding of the
economics and potential of those which are promising but still uncertain.
Renewable energy sources, however, are not expected to make a major
contribution to energy supplies this century, although they may have a greater
role in the twenty-first century. The Department of Energy’s estimate is that
some £17-25 million was spent in 1986—87 in support of its renewable energy
programme; work is being concentrated on the most promising technologies,
including wind energy, geothermal hot dry rocks, tidal energy, passive solar
design and biofuels.
Wind power constitutes a resource of considerable national significance. In
1986 a vertical-axis wind turbine, 25 m (82 ft) in diameter and generating
160 kW, the first of its kind in the world, was inaugurated at Carmarthen Bay
(Dyfed). The Department is supporting two other major projects: a 60 m (200 ft)
diameter, 3-MW horizontal-axis wind turbine on Orkney, in collaboration with
the NSHEB, expected to begin working later in 1987: and a 1-MW, 55 m (180 ft)
diameter wind turbine at Richborough (Kent). The latter is also receiving
support from the CEGB, the European Community and the private sector. The
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
287
Exploration
Production
Department of Trade and Industry is supporting, through its National Engineer¬
ing Laboratory at East Kilbride, the operation of a test site for small-scale and
medium-scale wind turbines at Eaglesham, near Glasgow. The Energy Research
Group of the Science and Engineering Research Council is supporting a number
of projects on the integration of wind and diesel electrical generation, which has
particular relevance to small, isolated communities.
Under its geothermal hot dry rock programme, the Department is investi¬
gating the economic possibilities of extracting heat from rocks at great depth.
Research, involving government expenditure of some £20 million since 1977, is
mainly carried out by the Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall, where a
project is being conducted to establish the technology for creating a suitable
deep underground heat exchange zone from which the heat could be withdrawn.
In 1986 a £5-5 million extension to the tidal resource programme was
announced. This includes advanced investigations into a Severn barrage on a
line from near Cardiff to Weston-super-Mare (Avon); a contribution towards
studies into a Mersey barrage; and generic studies, including construction
techniques and the potential of similar sites around Britain.
Passive solar design is considered the best way to utilise solar energy in
Britain and has already proved cost-effective in both domestic and non-domestic
buildings, using their form and fabric to admit, store and distribute solar energy
for heating and improving daylight. The Department of Energy’s research and
development programme has shown that by incorporating such features into
both new and existing houses energy consumption can be significantly reduced.
In recognition of the potential of, and importance of releasing, passive solar
energy, the Department is increasing expenditure over the next two years. A
major project initiated in 1987, with European Community backing and
including the British glass manufacturer Pilkingtons pic, was the establishment
of a test centre at Strathclyde University, which will facilitate experiments on
passive solar design and equipment.
Biofuels offer possibly the largest contribution from the renewable energy
resources in the medium term. The main work of the Department’s programme
is on the combustion of wastes, anaerobic digestion (particularly as applied to
the production and use of landfill gas) and energy forestry.
The Department also has a low-level research and development programme
into wave energy, supporting an inshore project on the island of Islay following a
feasibility study at the Queen’s University of Belfast.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials is met by
imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important contribution
to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1985 totalled 307 million
tonnes, valued at £1,461 million. The total number of employees in the
extraction industry was 36,000 in 1985. The locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the map on p 288.
Exploring for and exploiting indigenous metalliferous mineral resources to meet
the needs of industry are being encouraged by the Government. The British
Geological Survey is carrying out a long-term programme for the Department of
Trade and Industry aimed at identifying areas with the potential for economic
extraction of minerals.
The tonnage extracted of some of the main non-fuel minerals produced in
Britain is given in Table 30. In terms of value, production of common sand and
gravel was estimated at £398 million in 1985, limestone and dolomite £359

salt £54 million, tin £47 million, potash £39 million, fluorspar £17 million,
gypsum and anhydrite £16 million and chalk £13 million. Britain is a major
world producer of several important industrial minerals including china clay,
ball clay, fuller s earth, celestite and gypsum, and also produces significant
amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, fluorspar, potash, salt, silica sands,
fireclay, common clay and shale, barytes and talc, mostly for home consump¬
tion. Small amounts of diatomite, slate, calcspar, chert and flint, anhydrite and
china stone are also produced. In 1985 the production of metal from non-ferrous
ores totalled 15,500 tonnes, mainly tin and zinc from Cornwall and lead from
northern England. The Cornish mines, the only significant tin mines in the
European Community, produced some 5,000 tonnes in 1985, satisfying about
half of Britain’s demand. Small amounts of copper and silver were produced in
association with tin and zinc. Planning permission has recently been granted
for a large opencast tungsten mine at Hemerdon (near Plymouth).
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock (from limestone, igneous rock
and sandstone) as aggregates for use in construction constitutes two-thirds, by
value, of Britain’s output of non-fuel minerals. Britain is the world’s second
largest producer of marine-dredged sand and gravel (16-3 million tonnes in
1985).

Water
Britain’s water supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
boreholes. Water for public supply in Britain amounted to about 19,500
megalitres (Ml) a day in 1986 and average daily supply per head was nearly 350
litres. About 99 per cent of the population in Great Britain and over 97 per cent
in Northern Ireland are connected to the public water supply system.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and

sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption. Since 1981 optional metering for domestic
users has been available throughout England and Wales, and a joint study by the
Department of the Environment and the water industry has recommended a
series of large-scale trials of compulsory domestic metering.
In England and Wales the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales
are jointly responsible for policy in relation to the conservation, augmentation,
distribution and proper use of water resources and provision of water supplies;
the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services; the restoration and
maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters; and the
use of inland waters for navigation and recreation. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible for policy
relating to land drainage, flood protection, sea defence, and the protection and
development of fisheries.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services; the development of
water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution;
sewerage; sewage treatment; river management; land drainage; sea defence;
recreation; and freshwater fisheries. Water authorities’ estimated revenue for
1987-88 is some £2,840 million. Their management boards are appointed by
ministers. However, legislation is planned to privatise the water authorities’
utility functions of water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment and disposal in
England and Wales, with a view to removing government financial controls,
improving services and involving the public and the workforce more closely in
ownership of the industry. A new public body, the National Rivers Authority,
will be set up to take over responsibility for the regulatory and river manage¬
ment functions, including pollution control and water quality regulation,
water conservation and resource planning, fisheries, land drainage and flood
protection.
District councils usually act as agents of water authorities for the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of public sewers in their areas.
There are 29 statutory water supply companies, accounting for about one-
quarter of total supplies, which are operating under the Water Act 1973. Special
arrangements govern the relationship of these companies to the water
authorities.
Some 26,300 Ml a day were abstracted in England and Wales in 1985, of which
public water supplies accounted for 16,650 Ml a day. The Central Electricity
Generating Board took some 4,400 Ml a day primarily for cooling in connection
with electricity generation, other industry about 3,950 Ml a day and the
remainder was used in agriculture and fish farming.
Water authorities have powers to restrict consumption when there are severe
water shortages. Under the Drought Act 1976 they can limit or prohibit the use
of water and, if necessary, restrict domestic water supplies.
In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. In addition, the Central
Scotland Water Development Board is primarily responsible for developing large
water sources and supplying water in bulk to its five constituent member
authorities, the regional councils in central Scotland.

Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
An average of 2,200 Ml a day was supplied in Scotland in 1985-86. The
Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for the promotion of the
conservation of water resources and the provision by water authorities of
adequate water supplies, and also has a duty to promote the cleanliness of rivers
and other inland waters and the tidal waters of Scotland.
The Water Service of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland is
responsible for water supply and sewerage throughout Northern Ireland. The
Department is also responsible for the conservation, cleanliness and planned
development of Northern Ireland’s water resources. Northern Ireland has
abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic and industrial use. An
average of 690 Ml of water a day was supplied in 1986.
Investment is taking place to ensure that there is an adequate water supply to
meet future demand. The Thames Water Authority is constructing an 80-km
(50-mile) distribution system to meet the growing demand for water in London.
When completed in 1994, it will be the largest urban distribution system in the
world. North West Water has embarked on a major 25-year programme of
investment to clean up the polluted rivers of the Mersey Basin. In 1986-87
capital expenditure on water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal amounted to
some £943 million in England and Wales, £101 million in Scotland and £26
million in Northern Ireland.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the Water
Research Centre. Its membership includes water undertakings, consulting
engineers, manufacturers and overseas organisations. It has three laboratories:
at Stevenage (Hertfordshire), which deals with water and waste water treatment,
at Medmenham (Buckinghamshire), which is concerned with environmental
protection (including water quality and pollution); and at Swindon (Wiltshire),
which is concerned with instrumentation, water mains and sewers. Other
organisations conducting research include Hydraulics Research Limited, uni¬
versities, the Meteorological Office and several institutes of the Natural
Environment Research Council.

Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level of efficiency and productivity. About
2-5 per cent of the working population are engaged in agriculture and the
industry produces nearly two-thirds of Britain’s food requirements compared
with just under a half in 1960, and four-fifths of that which can be grown in a
temperate climate compared with nearly two-thirds in 1960. Food accounted for
10 per cent of Britain’s imports by value in 1986, compared with about a quarter
in the 1960s. Gross output in 1986 was £12,198 million, about 3-8 per cent of
gross domestic product. Britain is also a major exporter of agricultural produce
and food products, agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
The Government aims to foster an efficient and competitive agriculture
industry through the provision and sponsorship of research, development and
advisory services, the provision of financial support where appropriate,
measures to control disease, pests and pollution, and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It also encourages the industry to
adopt high standards on animal welfare. The Agriculture Act 1986 gives
agriculture ministers a responsibility to achieve a balance between the interests
of agriculture, the economic and social interests of rural areas, conservation and
recreation, and plans have been published to encourage alternative uses of
farmland and a more diverse rural economy.
Just over three-quarters of the land area is used for agriculture, the rest being
mountain, forest or put to urban and other uses. The area of agricultural land
has been declining, although there has been a reduction in the net rate of loss in
recent years. There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and
grass. In hill country, where the area of cultivated land is often small, some 6
million hectares (over 15 million acres) are also used for rough grazing. Soils
vary from the thin poor ones of highland Britain to the rich fertile soils of
low-lying areas such as the fenlands of eastern England. The cool temperate
climate and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season;
streams rarely dry up and grassland is green throughout the year.
In 1986 there were some 260,000 farm holdings in Britain, of which 71 per cent
in England, Scotland and Wales were wholly or mainly owner-occupied, while
virtually all the farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied. It is estimated
that 11 per cent of holdings in the largest size group accounted for about 55 per
cent of output, while the smallest size of holding (which accounted for 44 per
cent of farms) produced less than 3 per cent of output. In Wales and Northern
Ireland, output from smaller farms is more significant than in the rest of
Britain. The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses is
106 hectares (262 acres).

The number of people engaged in agriculture is about 680,000. The labour
force continues to decline slightly, and the level of mechanisation to increase.
Labour productivity improved substantially between 1976 and 1986. Total
farming income in 1986 was an estimated £1,411 million.
There are over 500,000 tractors and some 55,000 combine harvesters in use.
A wide variety of other machines for harvesting and preservation of grass are
also employed. Horticultural crops such as blackcurrants and brussels sprouts
are frequently harvested by machine, and milking machines are used on the vast
majority of dairy farms. The majority of farms have a direct electricity supply, the
remainder having their own generators.
Although dairy herd monitoring and account analysis have been computer¬
ised for many years, the recent introduction of the microcomputer has produced
major changes in farm business management. Budgeting and the monitoring of
cash-flow and performance are now frequently computerised, while computer
models of typical farms allow a wide range of crops and livestock to be
considered, along with demands for labour, land, capital and buildings. The
Government provides a topical information service to farmers and growers
through the Prestel viewdata service.

About three-fifths of full-time farms are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle
and sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle are reared in the hill and moorland
areas of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening occurs partly in better grassland areas, as does
dairying, and partly on arable farms. British livestock breeders have developed
many of the cattle, sheep and pig breeds with world-wide reputations, for
example, the Hereford and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey
and Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Because of developments in artificial insemination and embryo transfer, Britain
is able to export semen and embryos from high-quality donor animals.
Table 32 shows the number of livestock and output of livestock products.
Most dairy cattle in England and Wales and a significant proportion in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are bred by artificial insemination. The average size of
dairy herds in Britain was 60 in 1986 while the average yield of milk per dairy
cow was 4,933 litres (1,084 gallons). Average household consumption of liquid

(including low-fat milks) per head in 1986 was 2-1 litres (3-7 pints) per week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is predominant. The remainder is derived
from suckler herds producing high-quality beef calves in the hills and uplands,
where the traditional British beef breeds, such as Hereford and Aberdeen Angus,
continue to be important. Imported breeds which have established themselves
include the Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian Blue.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between them. Research has provided vaccine and serum
protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases. Although lamb production is
the main source of income for sheep farmers, wool is also important.
Grass supplies 60 to 80 per cent of the feed for cattle and sheep; grass
production has been enhanced by the increased use of fertilisers, irrigation and
methods of grazing control, and improved herbage conservation for winter feed.
Rough grazings are used for extensively grazed sheep and cattle, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.

aThis figure excludes turkeys.
Pig production occurs in most areas but is particularly important in eastern and
northern England. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units
and larger herds.
Output of poultry meat has continued to benefit from better husbandry and
genetic improvements. Since 1975 production has increased by over a third and
reached about 922,000 tonnes in 1986. Production of broilers from holdings of
over 100,000 birds accounts for over a half of total production. In 1986, egg
production was over 1,000 million dozen. About two-thirds of laying birds are in
flocks of 20,000 or more. Britain remains broadly self-sufficient in poultry meat
and eggs.
The welfare of farm animals is protected by regulations and it is an offence to
cause unnecessary pain or distress to livestock on commercial farms. For
example, there are regulations to control such operations as castration and tail
docking, and requiring owners of intensive units to arrange for the daily
inspection of their stock and the equipment on which it depends. There are
advisory codes and recommendations for the welfare of all major species of farm

animals and compliance is monitored by the State Veterinary Service. Among
government proposals in 1986-87 were safeguards for the protection of sheep
exported for slaughter; new regulations on the welfare of battery hens; a ban on
singly penned veal-calf crates; and new codes of practice on the welfare of poultry
and rabbits.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council, an independent body set up by the
Government, keeps under review the welfare of farm animals on agricultural
land, at markets, in transit and at the place of slaughter, and advises on any
legislative changes it considers necessary.
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found mainly in eastern
and central southern England and eastern Scotland. In 1986 cereals were grown
on 4 million hectares (10 million acres), with a record area devoted to wheat.
Total cereal production, at some 24-5 million tonnes, was the second highest
ever. About one-third of the wheat crop is normally used for flour milling, and
about one-third for animal feed. About 15 per cent of the barley crop is used for
malting and distilling and about 40 per cent for animal feed. Exports of wheat
and barley have increased substantially, accounting in recent years for about a
quarter of total production. There has been a rapid increase in the oilseed rape
crop; the seed is crushed to obtain vegetable oil and the solid matter left is used
for animal feed.
Large-scale potato and vegetable production is undertaken in the fens (in
Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers
Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early potatoes
are an important crop in south-west Wales, Kent and south-west England.
High-grade seed potatoes are grown in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides about 50 per cent of require¬
ments, most of the remainder being refined from raw sugar imported from
developing countries under the Lome Convention.
Table 33 gives figures on the area, harvest and yield of the main crops.
In 1986 the land utilised for horticulture was about 251,300 hectares (621,100
acres), of which vegetables grown in the open (excluding potatoes) accounted for
184,300 hectares (455,500 acres), orchards for 34,830 hectares (86,100 acres),
small fruit for 15,630 hectares (38,610 acres), bulbs and flowers grown in the
open for 5,440 hectares (13,450 acres) and hardy nursery stock for 7,030
hectares (17,360 acres). Crops grown in glasshouses accounted for 4,070
hectares (10,050 acres).
Field vegetables account for about 40 per cent of the value of horticultural
output and are widely grown throughout the country. Most horticultural
enterprises are increasing productivity with the help of improved planting
material, new techniques and the widespread use of machinery. Some field
vegetables, for example, are raised in blocks of compressed peat or loose-filled
cells, a technique which reduces root damage and allows plants to establish
themselves more reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, flowers, pot
plants and nursery stock. Widespread use is made of automatic control of
heating and ventilation, and semi-automatic control of watering. Energy-
efficient glasshouses use thermal screens, while low-cost plastic tunnels extend
the season for certain crops previously grown in the open.
Under the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (see p 298), a
wide range of horticultural produce is subject to common quality standards.
The Government is keen to encourage the growth of exports related to
agriculture and their value is increasing in real terms; they amounted to £6,383

aThe hot, drought-affected summers of 1975 and 1976 had an impact on yields in those years.
Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding
million in 1986, of which exports of food and drink accounted for £5,368
million, with the main markets being Western Europe, North America and the
Middle East. Exports include speciality products such as fresh salmon, Scotch
whisky, biscuits, jams and conserves, as well as beef and lamb carcasses and
cheese. Food from Britain, a national marketing organisation responsible for
improving the marketing of British produce in the domestic and overseas
markets, was set up in 1983. The British Food Export Council represents its
export arm for fresh and processed food and drink, and identifies suppliers for
customers, organises programmes of visits and meetings for overseas custom¬
ers, and, with the British Overseas Trade Board, co-ordinates British pavilions
at the world’s major agricultural exhibitions. The British Agricultural Export
Council provides a similar service for the agricultural and horticultural supply
industries: products and services offered by its members include all types of
machinery, seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, feedingstuffs, livestock and semen,
veterinary preparations and equipment, and consultancy. In 1986, Britain
exported some 72,400 wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, maintaining
its position as the world's largest exporter.

Agricultural Show, held at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, provides an opportunity
for overseas visitors to see what British agriculture has to offer. A typical
attendance for the four open days is 200,000, including 16,000 from overseas.
Virtually every British agricultural machinery manufacturer is represented at
the show, which is also the most important pedigree livestock event in the
country. Other major agricultural displays include the annual Royal Smithfield
Show, held in London, which exhibits agricultural machinery, livestock and
carcasses, and the annual Royal Highland Show, held in June at Ingliston near
Edinburgh. There are also several important regional shows.
Agricultural products are marketed by private traders, producers’ co-operatives
and marketing boards, the latter being producers’ organisations (each including
a minority of independent members appointed by agriculture ministers) with
certain statutory powers to regulate the marketing of milk, wool and potatoes.
For the most part the boards buy from producers or control contracts between
first buyers; the Potato Marketing Board, however, maintains only a broad
control over marketing conditions leaving producers free to deal individually
with buyers. For home-grown cereals, meat and livestock, apples and pears,
there are marketing organisations representing producer, distributor and
independent interests.
Food from Britain is responsible for improving the marketing of food and
agricultural products, both in the domestic market and abroad. It has
introduced a ‘Foodmark’ symbol under which producers are able to guarantee
the quality of fresh and lightly processed foods to the consumer.
Substantial investment—over £100 million in new fixed assets in 1976—86—is
being made by agricultural and horticultural co-operatives concerned with
marketing and storing products. A number of central co-operative grain stores
have been established, and new vegetable groups have been formed to meet the
demand from retailers for a continuous supply of fresh, quality produce; fruit
marketing co-operatives are also expanding. Food from Britain provides a full
range of advisory services for co-operatives and the Government assists their
development with grants.
Four government departments have joint responsibility—the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland, the Welsh Office and the Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland.
The stated aims of the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy,
which accounts for about two-thirds of the Community’s budget, are to increase
agricultural productivity and thereby to ensure that the agricultural community
has a fair standard of living, to stabilise the agricultural market, to guarantee
regular supplies of food and to provide these supplies at a reasonable price.
Decisions on the level of price support are taken annually by the Council of
Ministers on the basis of proposals presented by the European Commission. For
many commodities these measures consist of a minimum intervention price at
which agencies of the member states will purchase production, thereby putting
a floor in the market, and levies made on imports to maintain internal support
prices. Schemes may be introduced for subsidised disposal of stocks to
consumers within the Community where this can be done without disrupting
internal markets. The export of surpluses is facilitated by the provision of export
refunds to enable Community exporters to sell on world markets at the going
price. There is also provision for certain direct payments, including beef and
sheepmeat premiums, to producers.

The support prices, as well as rates of levy, export refunds and other aids, are
set in European Currency Units and are converted into the currencies of the
member states at fixed rates of exchange (commonly called ‘green rates’) which
do not vary automatically in line with changes in market exchange rates. The
green rates can thus be out of line with the market rate of exchange between
each currency and the European Currency Unit, giving rise to different real
support price levels in the different member states. Monetary compensatory
amounts, based on the percentage difference between the green and market
rates of each currency, are applied to prevent distortions in trade. They operate
as import subsidies and export levies for countries whose currencies’ market
rates are below the green rates, and as import levies and export subsidies in the
opposite case.
In order to reduce the costs of the agricultural policy, the British Government
has sought to obtain improvements, in particular by bringing support prices
more into line with market forces and by containing the costs of the policy. In
December 1986, during Britain’s Presidency of the Community, major steps in
the process of reform were taken. It was agreed that Community milk
production should be reduced by 9-5 per cent over two years, and that recourse
to intervention in the beef sector should be restricted. This latter measure
ensures an effective reduction of 13 per cent in beef support prices. Britain
seeks further action to extend reforms to the cereals and other sectors.
The Community’s agricultural expenditure is channelled through the Euro¬
pean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The Fund’s guarantee section
finances market support arrangements, while the guidance section provides
funds for structural reform, for example, farm modernisation and investment,
and payments to assist certain farmers to change to alternative enterprises.
Expenditure in Britain in 1986-87 on price guarantees, grants and subsidies
and on Common Agricultural Policy market regulations was estimated to be
£282 million and £1,296 million respectively. About £1,331 million was
reimbursed from the Community budget.
Potatoes and wool are not covered by the Common Agricultural Policy; price
guarantees for potatoes are operated through the Potato Marketing Board and
the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, and a price stabilisation
fund for wool is administered by the British Wool Marketing Board.
Producers also receive support through certain capital and production grants,
some based on Community decisions. Grants are available to assist farmers and
horticulturists with farm improvement plans, and there is special financial help
for hill and upland farmers in the form of headage payments on cattle and sheep
(known as compensatory allowances). Community assistance may also be made
to help to improve facilities for the marketing and processing of agricultural
products and to provide a premium payment to specialised beef producers, while
launching aid is available to production and marketing groups in the
horticultural sector.
Local authorities provide some 6,410 statutory smallholdings in England and
960 in Wales. They make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to
their tenants. Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the
Government, which, while now seeking to dispose of holdings to sitting tenants,
still owns and maintains about 119,000 hectares (293,000 acres) of land
settlement estates, comprising some 1,570 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (in Strathclyde, Highland, Western Isles,
Orkney and Shetland) much of the land is held by tenants known as crofters.
Crofting is administered by the Crofters Commission, and benefits from
government grants for land improvements and some other agricultural work.

Tenancy
Legislation
Agriculture and
Protection of
the Countryside
The agricultural holdings legislation protects the interests and rights of
landlords and tenants, with provision for arbitration in the event of a dispute.
Most agricultural tenants have the right to contest a notice to quit, which is
then ineffective unless the landlord obtains consent to its operation from an
independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in
Scotland the Scottish Land Court). On termination of tenancy, the tenant is
entitled to compensation in accordance with a special code. There are provisions
for succession of a close relative on the death of a tenant but this does not apply
in England and Wales to new tenancies which have come into effect since 12
July 1984.
Practically all farms in Northern Ireland are owner-occupied, but, under a
practice known as ‘conacre’, occupiers not wishing to farm all their land let it
annually to others. About one-fifth of agricultural land is so let, and is used
mainly for grazing.
Agriculture ministers have a general duty to seek to achieve a reasonable balance
between the needs of an efficient and stable agriculture industry and other
interests in the countryside, including the conservation of its natural beauty
and amenity and the promotion of its enjoyment by the public. In addition, they
are specifically required to further conservation of the countryside in the
administration of capital grant schemes for farmers in national parks and
in sites of special scientific interest designated by the Nature Conservancy
Council.
The Government has designated nine farming areas in Britain, which are of
particular importance for their landscapes, historic significance and value as
natural habitats, as ‘environmentally sensitive areas’. The areas are: in England,
the Broads (in Norfolk and Suffolk), the Pennine Dales (in Durham, North
Yorkshire and Cumbria), the Somerset Levels and Moors, the eastern South
Downs (mainly in West Sussex) and West Penwith (in Cornwall): in Wales, the
Cambrian Mountains: in Scotland, Loch Lomond (in Strathclyde and Central
Regions) and Breadalbane (mainly in Tayside); and in Northern Ireland, the
Mourne Mountains. Designating orders for seven further areas are to be laid at
the end of 1987: Breckland (Norfolk and Suffolk), the North Peak (Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire), the Suffolk river
valleys (Suffolk and Essex), the Test Valley (Hampshire), the Shropshire
borders—Clun (Shropshire), the western South Downs (West Sussex and
Hampshire), and Llewyn (Gwynedd). Farmers in these areas will be offered
incentive payments to continue with more traditional farming methods and
maintain the beauty and value of their farms. In England and Wales the
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (see p 301) advises farmers on,
and actively promotes, aspects of conservation such as wildlife habitats,
landscape features and farm buildings, and encourages the industry to adopt
high standards of pollution control.
The Farm and Countryside Initiative, launched in 1986 by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, as
part of the Manpower Services Commission’s Community Programme, aims to
provide long-term unemployed people in England with work to benefit rural
communities. Similar schemes operate in Scotland and Wales.
In February 1987 government plans to encourage alternative uses of farmland,
increase diversity on farms and in the rural economy generally, and enhance
environmental protection were announced. These describe how the Govern¬
ment’s policies towards farming are being adjusted to reflect the changing scene
and potential in the rural economy as a whole. Expansion of the traditional
forestry programme to reach 33,000 hectares (82,000 acres) a year, the
introduction of a farm woodland scheme, development of novel crops and

livestock, and diversification of farm enterprises are among the measures
proposed.
The Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive is responsible
for enforcing regulations on the health and safety of workers in agriculture.
These cover such matters as the guarding of field and stationary machinery,
workplaces, the fitting of safety cabs to tractors, and the use of chemicals.
In England and Wales the Government’s Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS), reorganised in 1986-87, provides a wide range of professional,
scientific, technical and veterinary services for agriculture and its ancillary
industries. Most types of advice and servicing are on a fee-paying basis through
subscriptions, individually priced consultancies, advisory contracts and special
schemes and services. Advice to farmers on conservation, rural diversification
and animal welfare is available free. Similar services are provided in Scotland by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Scottish Agricultural Colleges
and a section of the State Veterinary Service. In Northern Ireland these services
are available from the Department of Agriculture’s advisory service.
Information and advice are given on business management, cropping,
horticulture, livestock, land management, design, research and development,
and product marketing, and through analytical laboratory tests and special
product services. They identify problems requiring further investigation and
carry out the necessary research and development. They also advise the
Government on the scientific, technical and business implications of policy
proposals and assist in implementing policies concerning animal and plant
health, disease and pest eradication, food hygiene, animal welfare, land
drainage and other capital grant schemes, and safeguarding agricultural land in
relation to other land uses. The Service runs two Central Agricultural
Laboratories, 19 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations, six
regional laboratories with three sub-centres, and three veterinary laboratories. A
diagnostic service for the practising veterinary surgeon is provided by 19
veterinary investigation centres.
England, Scotland and Wales are free from many serious animal diseases. If they
were to occur, diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular
disease would be combated by a slaughter policy applied to all infected animals
and those exposed to infection, and by control over animal movements during
the outbreaks. Rigorous measures are being taken to eradicate sheep scab and
warble fly. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis is very low: cattle (except for
certain categories) are tested at regular intervals; those reacting to the test are
slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Significant progress has
been made towards eradicating Aujeszky’s disease in pigs. Because of compul¬
sory measures to eradicate brucellosis, begun on an area basis in 1972, England
and Wales were declared free of the disease for all practical purposes in 1981,
following a similar declaration for Scotland in 1980. In 1984 vaccination
replaced slaughter as the means of controlling Newcastle disease in poultry.
Strict controls are exercised on the import of animals, meat and meat
products, live poultry and other captive birds, and poultry meat, so as to prevent
the introduction of animal or poultry diseases. Special measures apply to
prevent the introduction of rabies, and dogs, cats and certain other mammals
are subject to import licence and six months’ quarantine. There are severe
penalties for breaking the law. There have been no cases of rabies outside
quarantine in Britain since 1970.
Northern Ireland has been kept free from the major animal diseases, including
rabies, foot-and-mouth disease and swine vesicular disease, and in 1982 the

incidence of brucellosis was reduced to the point where the country was officially
declared brucellosis-free.
Professional advice and action on the control of animal disease and the welfare
of farm livestock is the responsibility of the government veterinary services,
which have laboratory facilities and investigation centres performing specialist
research work and advising private practitioners responsible for treating
animals on the farm.
The agricultural departments are responsible for limiting the spread of plant
pests and diseases and for preventing the introduction of new ones. They also
issue the health certificates required by other countries to accompany plant
material exported from Britain. Certification schemes are operated to encourage
the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks.
The supply and use of pesticides is controlled under the Food and Environment
Protection Act 1985 and the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 made under
it. All pesticides supplied for use in Britain must have been approved under
statutory arrangements for their safety, efficacy and, where appropriate,
humaneness in use. The storage, sale, supply, use and advertisement of
pesticides will be progressively controlled and the regulations will be supported
by statutory codes of practice to give advice on recommended safe practice to
those who supply, store or use pesticides. The Act also enables ministers to
specify how much pesticide residue may be left in food, crops and feedingstuffs.
Consultations on proposals to introduce a system of statutory maximum residue
limits are in progress.
The manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products is prohibited
except under licence. Licences are issued by the agriculture ministers, who are
advised on safety, quality and efficacy by the Veterinary Products Committee
comprising independent experts.
The agriculture departments, the Agricultural and Food Research Council
(AFRC) and private industry share responsibility for research, much of which is
carried out in a network of research institutes, specialist laboratories and
experimental farms, although some research is undertaken by appropriate
university departments.
The AFRC, an autonomous body, receives funds from the science budget
through the Department of Education and Science and income from work
commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, by industry
and other outside bodies. The Council’s programme of research is carried out at
eight institutes which specialise in animal disease, animal physiology and
genetics, grassland and animal production, arable crops, horticulture, plant
sciences, food, and agricultural engineering. The Council also funds a number
of units, groups or departments in universities whose work is integrated with
the main AFRC programme, and, through its research grants scheme, supports
projects in universities, polytechnics and colleges. In addition to commissioning
research with the AFRC and other organisations, the Ministry carries out
research and development work in the laboratories, experimental husbandry
farms and horticulture stations of ADAS and in its food science laboratories.
The five Scottish agricultural research institutes, funded by the Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, cover broadly similar areas of research to
those of the AFRC institutes, but the research is directed primarily to the needs
of northern Britain. Development work in Scotland is carried out by the three
agricultural colleges. Research in Northern Ireland is carried out by the
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
303
EDUCATION
AND
TRAINING
Department of Agriculture in association with the Queen’s University of Belfast;
three agricultural colleges also cover applied research in agricultural science and
food technology.
Agricultural research is also conducted or sponsored by private industry, in
particular by related industries such as agrochemicals and agricultural machin¬
ery. The Government's policy is to increase the contribution by the agriculture
industry as a whole towards the cost of research from which it benefits. The
main aim of agricultural research is to maintain an efficient and competitive
industry in Britain consistent with high standards of animal welfare and care
for the environment.
About 80 per cent of food research is financed by the food industry.
Government-funded research is directed primarily to aspects of consumer
protection such as diet, and to basic research supporting the food industry’s
efforts to improve its competitiveness, for example by making food better to see
and to taste and by process control.
The total government-funded programme of research and development in
agriculture and food amounts to some £200 million a year. The work of the
AFRC and the agriculture departments is co-ordinated into national program¬
mes, primarily on the recommendations of the Priorities Board for Research and
Development in Agriculture and Food, which advises on the research needs of
the industries and the allocation of available resources between and within
areas of research.
Recent research developments include a mechanism for harvesting cereal,
seed and herbage crops by stripping them on site. In the field of genetic
manipulation, reconstituted sheep embryos transferred to foster ewes have
resulted in the birth of normal lambs with the genetic constitution of the donor
nucleus. Animals with desirable characteristics can thus be quickly multiplied.
The technique of inserting a gene from one animal into the germline cells of
another has been developed, resulting in the birth of‘transgenic’ lambs. Study
continues into the efficient use of nitrogen fertilisers, plant breeding (including
programmes to introduce disease resistance) and alternatives to straw burning.
Some 85 per cent of the British wheat acreage and about half the potato
acreage are planted with varieties bred by the publicly financed research
programme. Investigations into biological control methods have led to the
development of new microbial pesticides, which are reducing reliance on
chemical pesticides.
University and other degree and postgraduate courses provide training in the
scientific and technological aspects of agriculture and horticulture, the empha¬
sis being on science and economics. The agriculture departments give post¬
graduate awards annually for a range of subjects relating to food and
agriculture. There are also degree and postgraduate courses in veterinary
medicine. Science-based sandwich courses, leading to a Business & Technician
Education Council (BTEC) Higher National Diploma and available at agricultu¬
ral colleges, are designed for students wishing to enter farming or horticulture
with a good knowledge of the managerial and technological aspects of the
industry. The three-year BTEC National Diploma, also organised on a sandwich
basis, is a general course in agriculture with some colleges offering special
subjects such as arable farming, livestock production, dairy farming and farm
mechanisation. In Scotland, the Scottish Agricultural Colleges provide a variety
of courses.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board runs the Agricultural and
Horticultural Training Scheme, for mature as well as young workers, which can
lead to the issue of craft certificates or to a full apprenticeship. In Northern
Ireland training is provided by the Department of Agriculture.

Fisheries
Britain is one of Europe’s most important fishing nations. The fishing industry
provides about 66 per cent of British fish supplies, and is an important source of
employment and income in a number of ports. Cod, haddock, whiting, herring,
plaice and sole are found in the North Sea off the east coasts of Scotland and
England; mackerel, together with hake and other demersal fish, off the west
coast of Scotland; sole, plaice, cod and whiting in the Irish Sea; and mackerel,
sole and plaice off the south-west coast of England. Nephrops, crabs, lobsters
and other shellfish are found in the inshore waters all around the coast. In 1986
there were 15,900 fishermen in regular employment and nearly 6,250 occa¬
sionally employed. The Government aims to encourage the development of a
viable, efficient and market-orientated fisheries industry within the framework
of the European Community’s Common Fisheries Policy. The main concerns of
government fisheries policy are conservation and exploitation of sea fish stocks,
financial support for fleet modernisation and other measures, the improvement
of the industry’s technical and economic performance, the development of a
viable fish farming industry, and protection of the aquatic environment.
In 1986 demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea) accounted for
about 54 per cent by weight of total British landings, pelagic fish (caught near
the surface) for 34 per cent and shellfish for 12 per cent. Landings of all types of
fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British fishing vessels totalled 717,000
tonnes. Haddock and cod represented 22 and 19 per cent respectively of the total
value of demersal and pelagic fish landed, while whiting (5 per cent), plaice (4
per cent), mackerel (4 per cent) and sole (4 per cent) were the other most
important sources of earnings to the industry.
The British fish farming industry is a substantial and expanding business
mainly concerned with the production of salmon and trout although shellfish
and eel farming are growing. Estimated production in 1986 was 11,000 tonnes
of trout and 10,000 tonnes of salmon.
Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and canned fish and shellfish in 1986 totalled
415,000 tonnes, those of fish meal 236,000 tonnes and those of fish oils
170,000 tonnes. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products amounted to
351,000 tonnes. Following a British initiative, member states of the European
Community banned from January 1982 the import of primary whale products in
order to help to conserve whale populations.
In 1986 the British fishing fleet consisted of some 7,810 inshore vessels under
24-4 m (80 ft) in length and 210 deep-sea vessels longer than 24-4 m. Among
the main ports from which the fishing fleet operates are Aberdeen, Peterhead,
Fraserburgh (Grampian), Lerwick (Shetland), Kinlochbervie, Ullapool (High¬
land), North Shields (Tyne and Wear), Grimsby (South Humberside), Lowestoft
(Suffolk), Brixham (Devon), and Newlyn (Cornwall). The deep-sea fleet has been
reduced in number as fishing opportunities and the profitability of operations
in distant waters have declined.
The fisheries departments are responsible for the administration of legislation
concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under legislation administered by the Department of
Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority provides financial aid for the purchase of new
fishing vessels, vessel improvements, the provision and improvement of
processing plants, cold stores and ice plants, and towards the formation of

fishermen’s co-operatives. Other functions include research and development,
training, dissemination of information, publicity and promotion.
Community countries, and certain non-Community countries having fishery
agreements with the Community, may fish up to Britain’s 12-mile limit.
Designated countries may also fish in specified areas of Britain’s 6-to-12-mile
zone. No foreign vessels may fish within Britain’s 6-mile limit.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles in the mid-1970s, new
arrangements became necessary to control Community fishing in the greatly
extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest in such control, since a
sizeable proportion of the total catch within the 200-mile limits of member
states is taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in
distant waters (such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry’s total catch
more than that of other Community states.
In 1983 member states reached an agreement on a common fisheries policy
providing for new arrangements on access to coastal waters applicable for a
period of at least 20 years. Other features included a revised marketing regime,
regulations covering technical conservation measures such as mesh sizes for
nets, the allocation of catch quotas among member states within each year’s
total allowable catch, effective enforcement of the rules and financial aid to
promote the adaptation and development of the Community fishing fleet and the
fish farming industry.
In 1986 Britain, particularly during its tenure of the Presidency of the
European Community, was influential in promoting decisions which will
strengthen technical measures to conserve fish stocks in Community waters;
introduce more effective monitoring of member states’ compliance with
Community fishing policy; implement a ten-year structural policy for the
Community’s fishing industry, involving a commitment of about £500 million
over the first five years; and adopt reciprocal fisheries agreements with
non-Community countries while consolidating existing ones.
Fishery relations between the European Community and other countries are
governed by long-term framework agreements including reciprocal agreements
with Norway, the Faroe Islands and Sweden and non-reciprocal agreements with
several other countries. Annual Community quotas have also been established
in international waters in the north-west Atlantic and around Svalbard.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a research directorate
comprising laboratories dealing with marine and freshwater fisheries, shellfish,
marine pollution, fish farming and diseases. Work on the utilisation of fish is
undertaken by a research station at Torry, Aberdeen. There are also two
seagoing research vessels. In Scotland the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries maintains laboratories on marine and freshwater fisheries research as
well as three seagoing vessels. Department of Agriculture laboratories in
Northern Ireland monitor marine and freshwater fisheries.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in waters outside a limit of six miles from the coasts of the
British Isles. In Scotland, salmon fishing is a private right. In England and
Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary netting.
Forestry

Britain: about 7-3 per cent of England, 14-2 per cent of Scotland and 11-8 per

cent of Wales. The Government supports the continued expansion of forestry in
order to reduce dependence on imports of timber and to provide employment in
forestry and related industries.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain is 21 million hectares (5-1
million acres), 43 per cent of which is managed by the Forestry Commission and
the rest by private owners. The rate of new planting in 1985—86 was 4,300
hectares (10,700 acres) by the Commission and some 19,000 hectares (46,950
acres) by private woodland owners mainly in Scotland. Most planting is of
conifers in upland areas though the planting of broadleaved trees is encouraged
on suitable sites. An increasing proportion of new planting is being done by
private owners. During 1985-86 the Commission grant-aided some 850
hectares (2,100 acres) of new broadleaved planting under its various schemes.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at about 30,500 in 1986, with a further 9,200 people engaged in processing
home-grown timber.
British woodlands meet only 12 per cent of the nation’s consumption of wood
and wood products. At present only just over half of the Commission’s
woodlands are in production. Home timber production, however, is expected to
double over the next 20 years.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority in Great Britain. The
Commissioners give advice on forestry matters and are responsible to the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland and Wales. In pursuing timber production, forestry policy also takes
into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria, and the
Commission’s activities include wildlife conservation, the landscaping of
plantations and the provision of facilities for recreation. The Commission has
also encouraged the establishment of new timber-using industries. Forestry
research is carried out by the Commission at two research stations. Aid is also
given for research work in universities and other institutions, including the
Commonwealth Forestry Institute in Oxford. To rationalise its holdings and
achieve greater efficiency and commercial effectiveness, the Commission has
reduced its land and plantations by selling 114,000 hectares (281,000 acres)
since 1981. The Commission is financed partly by the Government and partly by
receipts from sales of timber and other produce and from rents.
A substantial number of private woods are in ownerships of under 100 hectares
(250 acres) in extent. The Government encourages private forestry through
appropriate tax reliefs. There is also a forestry grant scheme under which the
Commission aids planting by private owners. A special scheme encourages the
planting of broadleaved trees by the payment of higher levels of grant.
Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at three
universities and there are supervisory, craft and managerial level courses. The
Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists the
development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in the state
and private sectors.
The Department of Agriculture may acquire land for afforestation and give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. The state forest area has
grown steadily since 1945. By 1986, 73,000 hectares (182,000 acres) of
plantable land had been acquired, of which 57,000 hectares (140,000 acres)
were planted. There were about 13,500 hectares (33,000 acres) of privately
owned forest. Some 570 professional and industrial staff work in state forests.
15 Transport and
Communications
Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight have resulted
from the construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city
rail services (such as those operated by high-speed trains), the modernisation of
many ports, the use by airlines of more efficient and quieter aircraft, and
expansion schemes at many airports. The Channel Tunnel, on which construc¬
tion is expected to begin later in 1987, will have a significant impact on travel
between Britain and the continent of Europe. Communications are benefiting
from developments in microelectronics, computer and satellite technology, and
advances in materials, for example, the application of optical fibres in
telecommunications.
Transport policy rests on the fundamental aims of promoting economic
growth and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of
personal mobility, while improving safety, minimising damage to the environ¬
ment and using energy economically. Britain is taking an active part in the
development of a common transport policy by the European Community, this
being seen as essential for the application of the Treaty of Rome’s competition
rules and the completion of the Community’s internal market by 1992. While
some sectors of transport and communications operations remain publicly
owned, the Government is arranging for the introduction of private capital into
other sectors as part of its policy of reducing state involvement as much as
possible. This is also part of the Government’s wider aim of increasing
competition, so ensuring value for money, in transport services, both within
Britain and internationally. Measures to increase competition have been taken
in a number of sectors such as the bus industry and airline services.
Inland Transport
Passenger and freight traffic is carried mainly by road. At the end of 1986 there
were 21-7 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great Britain, of
which 18-8 million were private cars and light goods vehicles, 0-6 million other
goods vehicles, 11 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds, and 125,000
public road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of cars has
been growing rapidly for many years and the car is the most popular form of
transport, with car and taxi travel accounting for some 82 per cent of passenger
mileage within Great Britain. Buses and coaches account for about 8 per cent of
passenger mileage, rail for 7 per cent and air 0-6 per cent. Road haulage has a
dominant position in the movement of inland freight, accounting for about 84
per cent of tonnage carried and for about three-fifths of tonne-km. Railways,
inland waterways, coastal shipping and pipelines are important in carrying
certain types of freight, particularly bulk goods.
ROADS Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain is continuing to grow, having risen by 5 per
cent in 1986 to some 297,650 million vehicle-km. In 1986 the road network
totalled some 374,000 km (232,400 miles), of which 2,956 km (1,837 miles)
were trunk motorways (see Table 34). Although motorways and trunk roads
account for 4 per cent of road mileage, they carry 30 per cent of road traffic
including nearly 40 per cent of heavy goods vehicle traffic.

a In addition, there were 101 km (63 miles) of local authority motorway in England and 24 km (15 miles) in
Scotland. In April 1987 some 21 km (13 miles) of trunk motorway were under construction in England and 3 km
(2 miles) in Scotland.
New and improved roads have resulted in much shorter travelling times,
particularly for long-distance journeys and those between cities, and have
brought considerable benefits to industry, commerce and road haulage opera¬
tors, and increased personal mobility. The Government’s programme to improve
motorways and other trunk roads (which form a basic network linking major
centres of population, industrial areas and ports) is intended to assist economic
growth by reducing transport costs, removing through traffic (especially lorries)
from unsuitable roads in towns and villages, and enhancing road safety.
Following a review of the motorway and trunk road programme in England in
1987, 82 new schemes with a total cost of £689 million were added to the
programme, increasing it to some 370 schemes worth some £5,000 million. The
programme’s aim is to improve the network and cater for the traffic expected in
the 1990s. Bypasses and relief roads account for about 50 per cent of the
schemes in the construction programme, which also includes projects intended
to increase the traffic capacity of major through routes and to improve junctions
on heavily used roads.
Much of the London area has benefited from the M25 London orbital route,
completed in 1986. Work on a privately financed project costing £86 million to
provide a new bridge across the Thames between Dartford and Thurrock to
handle the increase in traffic forecast on the M25 is expected to begin in 1988,
subject to parliamentary approval.
In Wales the priorities are improvements to the coast road in north Wales
(including the construction under the Conwy estuary of the first immersed tube
road tunnel to be built in Britain) and the upgrading of roads which are
important for industrial redevelopment.
The programme in Scotland includes planned extensions to the M74, M8 and
M80 motorways, the improvement of strategic routes beyond central Scotland to
areas such as the north east and some of the west-coast routes, and the
construction of more bypasses.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on building new links to the motorway
network, constructing more bypasses, and improving roads in the Belfast area
and other urban areas.
Responsibility for trunk road motorways and other trunk roads in Great Britain
rests in England with the Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland with the
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
309
Road Safety
Secretary of State for Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales.
The costs of construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
government. The highway authorities for non-trunk roads in England are the
county councils, the metropolitan district councils, the London borough
councils and the Common Council of the City of London. In Wales the
authorities are the county councils, and in Scotland the regional or islands
councils. In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environ¬
ment is responsible for the construction, improvement and maintenance of
public roads.
Research into all aspects of road construction, traffic engineering and
safety, and into problems associated with transport is carried out by the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory, the research arm of the Department
of Transport.
Although Great Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the
world, it has a good record on road safety, with one of the lowest road accident
death rates in the European Community. In 1986, 5,400 people were killed on
the roads, about 69,000 seriously injured and 247,000 slightly injured. The
number of deaths was the third lowest since 1954, although since then motor
vehicle traffic has risen by nearly 370 per cent.
A number of factors, such as developments in vehicle safety standards and
improvements in infrastructure (including motorways, bypasses and pedes-
trianisation of city centres), have contributed to the long-term decline in
casualty rates. The most significant recent reduction in casualties has come
from the compulsory wearing of seat belts for front-seat passengers of cars and
light vans. This reduction has been estimated at a minimum of 200 deaths and
7,000 serious injuries a year. Regulations require rear seat belts or child
restraints to be fitted to new cars registered since 1 April 1987. The standard of
conduct for road users is set out in the Highway Code, revised in March 1987.
Comprehensive regulations govern the design of vehicles, their use on the
roads, and the maintenance and testing of their mechanical condition. Under a
national ‘type approval’ scheme in Great Britain, all new cars must be of a type
that has been certified as meeting the required standards, and there is a similar
scheme for new goods vehicles. Private cars and light vans which are three or
more years old must be tested annually at private garages authorised as test
stations. (In Northern Ireland private cars six or more years old are tested at
official vehicle inspection centres.) Heavy goods vehicles are subject to annual
tests carried out at special testing stations.
Minimum ages are laid down for driving: 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles; 17 for driving cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that of the driver), motor cycles and
goods vehicles not over 3-5 tonnes gross laden weight: 18 for goods vehicles over
3-5 but not over 7-5 tonnes: and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats
and goods vehicles over 7-5 tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles, except new
residents holding certain non-British licences, are required to pass the driving
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Learners must display ‘L’ plates
on their vehicle and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a
qualified driver. There are national speed limits of 60 mph (97 km/h) on single
carriageway roads and 70 mph (113 km/h) on dual carriageway roads (including
motorways), unless a lower limit is indicated. In built-up areas there is a general
limit of 30 mph (48 km/h).
Under the Transport Act 1981, breath testing has become the main means of
determining a driver’s alcohol level; the statutory limit of breath alcohol
concentration for drivers is 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
breath. Several measures have been introduced to improve the safety of motor

cyclists, including the restriction of learner drivers to the less powerful
machines, a two-part motor-cycle driving test and a limit on the duration of the
motor-cycle provisional licence.
In July 1987 the Government issued for consultation a major review of road
safety policy, which proposed an objective of reducing road casualties by
one-third over the next 10 to 15 years. It suggested that the main task would be
to reduce casualties among vulnerable road-users (pedestrians, cyclists and
motor cyclists), particularly in urban areas, and that resources should be
redirected towards measures which were demonstrably cost-effective in terms of
casualty reductions. The principal elements would be vehicle safety engineering,
and road construction and improvements while additional research is also
planned in areas such as road user behaviour.
Traffic management schemes have been introduced in most urban areas to
minimise congestion, create a better environment and improve road safety. They
may include computerised traffic control systems, one-way systems, bus priority
measures, parking controls and pedestrian and cyclist facilities. Many towns
have shopping precincts which are specially designed for pedestrians and from
which motor vehicles are excluded for all or part of the day. In most town centres
on-street parking is controlled and waiting limits apply. City centres often have
zones where payment is required for on-street parking. In parts of central
London wheel clamps are used to immobilise illegally parked vehicles.
Urban traffic control systems, with traffic signals controlled by a central
computer, are in operation in over 50 urban areas in Britain. Systems developed
by the Department of Transport and British firms have achieved international
repute and are the most commonly used in the world. A recent enhancement of
these systems, which continuously measures and responds to the flow of traffic,
is already in operation in over 30 urban areas; among the locations in Britain
are London, Coventry, Southampton, Cambridge, Worcester, and around
Heathrow Airport.
Cyclists are particularly vulnerable in congested traffic conditions. Accord¬
ingly, most local authorities are implementing facilities to increase safety and
convenience for cyclists.
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles amounted to 101,000 million
tonne-km in 1986. There has been a move towards larger and more efficient
vehicles carrying heavier loads—about 75 per cent of the traffic, in terms of
tonne-km, is carried in vehicles of over 25 tonnes gross laden weight. Much of
the traffic is moved over short distances, with 78 per cent of the tonnage being
carried on hauls of 100 km (62 miles) or less, although the growth in road
haulage has been concentrated on long-distance traffic. Public haulage (private
road hauliers carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for 68 per cent of freight
carried in Great Britain in terms of tonne-km.
The environmental problems caused by lorries have become a matter of public
concern. The Government has introduced a number of measures to bring
economic benefits and increased protection to the environment and the public.
Safeguards on the design of lorries include restrictions on their dimensions,
while a number of measures have been taken to improve the enforcement of lorry
weights and safety. More bypasses are being built to keep lorries away from
residential areas. There is a programme of research and development, involving
vehicle and engine manufacturers, to reduce the noise from heavy lorries to less
than half the 1981 level and produce a quiet heavy vehicle for the 1990s. To
encourage the use of railways and inland waterways for the carriage of freight,
grants of up to 60 per cent are available towards the cost of construction or
modernisation of privately owned facilities where there are significant environ¬
mental benefits by the removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the roads.

Structure
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small, privately owned
businesses. Many of the 129,000 holders of an operator’s licence in 1986 had
only one vehicle and the average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. The
biggest operator in Great Britain is the National Freight Consortium set up by a
consortium of managers and employees to acquire the National Freight
Company from the Government.
Those operating goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross weight (with certain
special exemptions) require an operator’s licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and drivers’
hours. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms carrying their own
goods and standard licences, subdivided into ‘national only’ and ‘international’,
for hauliers operating for hire or reward. (In Northern Ireland operators carrying
their own goods do not require a licence.) Proof of professional competence is
required to obtain a standard licence. Regulations lay down limits on the hours
worked by drivers of goods vehicles, and there are also minimum rest periods.
Tachographs (which automatically record speed and distance covered, driving
time and stopping periods) must be fitted and used in most goods vehicles
over 3-5 tonnes gross weight in Great Britain.
International road haulage has grown rapidly and about 26 million tonnes a year
are carried in road vehicles to and from the continent of Europe and the Irish
Republic. Some 924,000 road goods vehicles were conveyed by ferry to the
Continent in 1986, of which nearly half were unaccompanied trailers. The
average length of haul for British registered vehicles is some 900 km (562 miles)
in each direction, compared with 73 km (45 miles) for internal road haulage.
International road haulage is governed mainly by bilateral agreements which are
in force with 27 other countries. Many place no restriction on the number of
British lorries entering the country concerned, although some agreements only
allow an annual quota. In 1986 the European Community (which also has a
quota of permits allowing haulage anywhere within the Community) agreed to
the principle of full liberalisation of international road haulage within the
Community, and to its proposed implementation by 1992.
There has been a long-term decline in the use of local bus services, mainly
because of the growth in ownership of private cars. In 1985—86 buses or coaches
carried some 5,635 million passengers on local services in Great Britain, 21 per
cent fewer than in 1976. However, the Transport Act 1985 contains a number of
measures which are stimulating competition in local bus services and increas¬
ing private sector participation in the industry.
These measures follow the reforms enacted in the Transport Act 1980, which
removed restrictions on operating long-distance express coach services and
excursions, allowing free competition between operators. This had a noticeable
effect on long-distance express coach services, bringing about reductions in
fares, the provision of more services and an increase of 40 per cent in the
number of passengers carried.
Major changes in the structure of the passenger transport industry are being
implemented as a result of the Transport Act 1985. The Act provides for the
privatisation of the National Bus Company (the largest single bus and coach
operator in Britain), which operated through some 70 subsidiaries in England
and Wales. Each subsidiary is being sold separately, with a preference for a
buy-out by the local management or employees. By August 1987, 41 subsidiaries
had been sold, of which 26 had been bought out by management or employee

teams. Negotiations are in progress for the sale of a number of other
subsidiaries.
The Transport Act 1985 also contains measures to encourage competition in
services formerly run directly by municipal authorities and by passenger
transport executives in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne
and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire in England and Strathclyde in
Scotland. Passenger transport executives and local authorities which ran
municipal bus undertakings have set up public transport companies, operating
under the Companies Acts, to which their bus undertakings have been
transferred.
Other public sector operators include the Scottish Transport Group (with
some 3,400 vehicles), which operates the main bus services in Scotland outside
the major cities and also runs ferries to the islands off the west coast of Scotland;
while in Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus Ltd
operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of the
services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have some 300 and
950 vehicles respectively.
London Regional Transport (LRT) is a nationalised industry, established
under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, with its board members
appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. Within LRT five separate
wholly owned subsidiaries have been established: London Buses Ltd (operating
some 5,200 buses), London Underground Ltd, LRT Bus Engineering Ltd,
Docklands Light Railway Ltd and London Transport International Services Ltd
(which provides consultancy services). Financial support is provided by central
government with a contribution from London’s ratepayers. LRT is required to
involve the private sector in the provision of services where this is more efficient,
and has been set targets for reductions in operating costs and revenue support.
There are some 5,600 privately owned undertakings (of which the majority
have fewer than five vehicles)1 comprising about 30,300 vehicles; only a small
proportion of these operators provide scheduled local bus services.
Double-deck buses are the main type of vehicle used for urban road passenger
transport in Britain and there are some 25,000 in operation. In addition, there
are 42,900 single-deck buses and coaches, and 79 trams (at Blackpool and
Llandudno which have Britain’s only remaining tramway systems).
Under the Transport Act 1985 the system of road service licensing (under which
a local bus operator needed a road service licence before starting operations) was
abolished in Great Britain (except London) in 1986. Under the new system,
operators have to register their services with the traffic commissioners (one for
each of the nine traffic areas of Great Britain), and must give six weeks’ notice
for new registration, variation or cancellation of services. Local authorities and
passenger transport executives then identify gaps and examine the need for
additional services which they consider to be socially necessary and are prepared
to subsidise, and are required to invite applications for operating these services
by open competitive tender to ensure that value for money is obtained.
The initial indications are that, while the level of bus services has been
generally maintained, many local authorities have achieved substantial savings
in subsidies to public transport. Innovations in public transport have occurred,
most notably a considerable increase in minibus services, now operating in over
200 towns and cities.
In addition, two grants are designed to encourage services in rural areas: a
rural innovation grant, administered in England by the Development Commis-
Excluding former National Bus Company subsidiaries.

sion and in Scotland and Wales by the appropriate Secretary of State; and a
transitional grant, payable on a sliding scale for four years to bus operators.
There are about 39,000 licensed taxis in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas;
London has some 14,200. In London and a number of other cities taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to very strict requirements and drivers must have
passed a test of their knowledge of the area. Hire cars with drivers may be
booked only through the operator and not hired on the street; in some areas
outside London hire cars are licensed.
The Transport Act 1985 provides for new arrangements for the operation of
taxis and hire cars, with the intention of increasing their role in public
transport. Restrictions by local authorities on granting taxi licences have been
relaxed so that a licence can be refused only if a local authority is satisfied that
there is no unfulfilled demand for taxis in its area. Operators of licensed taxis
are able to provide shared-ride services at separate fares. Taxi operators are also
able to run regular local services and can tender in competition with bus
operators for the services being subsidised by local authorities. In addition, they
may apply for a ‘restricted’ bus operator’s licence, allowing them to run one or
two minibuses without having to obtain a full bus operator’s licence.
By August 1987, 37 local regular bus services were being run by taxi
operators; a shared taxi scheme in London will become fully operative by October
1987.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be worked
by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway companies
in Great Britain were brought under public ownership, and in 1962 the British
Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary activities. In
Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of
the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service
on some 320 km (200 miles) of track.
In 1986—87 the Board’s turnover, including financial support and income from
other activities but excluding internal transactions, was £3,184 million, of
which £1,428 million was derived from rail passenger services and £557 million
from rail freight services. British Rail received £786 million in grants towards its
operations as compensation for the public service obligation to operate parts of
the rail passenger system which would not otherwise cover their costs. The
grant payable to British Rail has been gradually reduced since 1983, and new
objectives announced by the Secretary of State for Transport in 1986 involve
improvements in the quality of service provided and a reduction in government
support for passenger services.
At the end of March 1987 the Board employed some 167,000 people. Statistics
of British Rail's operations are given in Table 35.
The passenger network (see map, p 314) comprises a fast inter-city network,
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
services in and around the large conurbations, especially London and south-east
England. British Rail runs about 1,500 InterCity expresses each weekday,
serving about 150 business and leisure centres. Journey times on inter-city
routes have been reduced substantially as more track has been made suitable for
high-speed operations and as a result of faster trains, notably the InterCity
125s, operated by diesel trains, travelling at maximum sustained speeds of
125 mph (201 km/h). InterCity 125 trains provide nearly half of InterCity train
mileage and are the world’s fastest diesel trains. They operate from London to

north-east England and eastern Scotland; and on cross-country services
through the West Midlands, linking south-west England or south Wales with
north-west England or north-east England and Edinburgh.
About 25 per cent of route-mileage is electrified including British Rail’s
busiest Intercity route, linking London, the West Midlands, the North West and
Glasgow. A number of electrification schemes are in progress. The most
significant is a scheme costing £306 million at 1984 prices to electrify the
east-coast main line between London and Edinburgh (including the line from
Doncaster to Leeds), involving electrification of some 636 km (395 miles). The
first main stage, from Hitchin to Peterborough, has been completed, and since
May 1987 commuter services between King’s Cross and Peterborough have been
operated by electric trains. The line to Leeds will be electrified by 1988, with
completion of the scheme to Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh in 1991. An
£80 million scheme to electrify services between Glasgow and Ayr, with a branch
to Ardrossan, was completed in 1986. During 1987 electrified services on the
London—Colchester route were extended to Norwich and Harwich, while
electrified services were also introduced between Bishop’s Stortford and
Cambridge; a second line to Cambridge, from Royston, is being electrified and
electric services are planned to start in mid-1988.
British Rail has developed ways of reducing costs on its local passenger
services including the installation of automatic level crossings and radio
signalling. Substantial investment is being undertaken to replace the fleet of
diesel multiple-unit trains by two new types of vehicle with greater reliability and
low maintenance costs: a lightweight ‘Pacer’ railbus (with a bus-type body) and a
medium-weight ‘Sprinter’ diesel multiple-unit.
The most important freight commodities handled are coal and coke, iron and
steel, building materials and petroleum. Over 90 per cent of rail-freight revenue
is obtained from traffic in bulk commodities, most of it in trainloads.
Greater efficiency is being obtained with the introduction of new types of
wagon with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds, and of new, more
powerful locomotives, the latest of which can haul loads of 1,000 tonnes at

speeds of up to 130 km/h (81 mph). A network of some 130 daily scheduled
‘Speedlink’ high-speed freight services has been established between the major
industrial centres. Other developments, such as the concentration of freight
traffic at fewer but better-equipped terminals and a computer-based total
operations processing system, which monitors all consignments and freight
train and wagon movements in Great Britain, have contributed to a significant
increase in productivity and competitiveness.
British Rail has several other subsidiary activities. British Rail Engineering Ltd
(BREL), whose income amounted to £452 million in 1986—87, is one of the
largest railway general engineering companies in Europe. Its main functions are
major overhauls of British Rail’s rolling stock, and the design and manufacture
of railway vehicles and equipment for British Rail and other customers in
Britain and overseas. Heavy maintenance of British Rail stock has become the
responsibility of British Rail Maintenance Ltd, which has taken control of
several former BREL works. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest
of its type in the world. Transmark provides consultancy services overseas on
railway and associated operations. Travellers-Fare is responsible for catering
facilities at 163 stations, while Intercity catering provides restaurant and buffet
facilities on most Intercity trains.
In order to concentrate its resources on running the main railway business,
British Rail has privatised its hovercraft subsidiary, and its harbour and ferry
subsidiary, and sold or leased its 29 hotels to other operators since 1981. Since
1980 British Rail has also sold surplus property worth over £420 million and
has attracted substantial private sector funds for commercial development
schemes in connection with railway and station improvements. British Rail has
also adopted a policy of competitive tendering for its rolling stock needs, and has
invited private sector firms to play a greater role in train and station catering.
Over 760 million passenger journeys were made on London Underground trains
in 1986—87. Trains operate on 408 km (254 miles) of railway, of which about
167 km (104 miles) are underground, and serve 273 stations, with some 460
trains operating in the peak periods. Substantial investment is in progress,
particularly on station modernisation and ticketing facilities. The Docklands
Light Railway, a £77 million project for a 12-km (7-5-mile) route with 15
stations, financed by London Regional Transport and the London Docklands
Development Corporation, began operating in August 1987.
Other public rail services in Great Britain are the Glasgow Underground and
the Tyne and Wear Metro, a 56-km (35-mile) light rapid transit system with over
40 stations.
There are over 40 small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in Great
Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited services for
tourists and railway enthusiasts. The main aim of most of these railways, such
as the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, is the preservation of steam traction.
Britain and France have agreed to facilitate the construction of a fixed link
across the Channel and have chosen the project submitted by the Channel
Tunnel Group/France Manche (now known jointly as Eurotunnel) for twin
single-track rail tunnels with a vehicle shuttle service for cars, coaches and
heavy goods vehicles. The project, estimated to cost some £2,700 million at 1986
prices, will be the largest civil engineering project in Europe to be financed and
constructed by the private sector. It is expected to bring substantial benefits to
industry and to travellers through the quicker carriage of both passengers and
freight.

The 50-km (31-mile) link will carry through rail services and a drive-on,
drive-off vehicle shuttle service using specially designed shuttle trains. Journey
time for the shuttle trains between the two terminals, Cheriton (near Folke¬
stone) and Frethun in France, will be some 35 minutes, with trains travelling at
a maximum speed of 160 km/h (100 mph). The terminal at Cheriton will cover
140 hectares (350 acres) and will contain a rail loop for the shuttle trains to run
into the tracks beside the platforms. Road improvements in Kent are planned
which will ensure good access to the tunnel terminal. Through rail passenger
and freight services will be operated by British Rail and their continental
partners. In May 1987 agreement was reached on the payments to be made to
Eurotunnel by British Rail and by Societe Rationale des Chemins de Fer
Frangais for the use of the tunnel. British Rail envisages investment of nearly
£400 million in new passenger and freight rolling stock, track and signalling
improvements, a new international passenger terminal at Waterloo (London),
freight facilities and a train maintenance depot. The Government has been
concerned to ensure that the environmental damage caused by construction is
minimised, and a number of measures have been taken, while a planning
control framework will deal with environmental matters during construction.
The Channel Link Treaty with France, signed in 1986, contains provisions to
safeguard the public interest of both countries in matters such as safety and the
environment, deals with matters of national jurisdiction, provides arrange¬
ments for arbitration in the event of disputes over interpretation of the Treaty
between the governments and the concessionaires, sets out the private sector
nature of the scheme, and provides for compensation to the promoter in the
event of political interference or cancellation by the Government. A concession
agreement between Britain, France and the Channel Tunnel Group/France
Manche was also signed in 1986. It gives the concessionaires the right to build
and operate the tunnel for a period of 55 years, after which ownership would
revert to the governments. The Channel Tunnel Act 1987 authorised construc¬
tion, in accordance with the Treaty, and allowed the ratification of the Treaty
and the coming into operation of the concession agreement, both in July 1987.
Construction work is expected to begin later in 1987 with a view to services
through the tunnel being inaugurated in 1993.
The inland waterways of Great Britain are popular for recreation, make a
valuable contribution to the environment and play an important part in land
drainage and water supply. They are also used to a limited extent for
freight-carrying. An official survey of inland waterway freight traffic reported
that in 1985, 64 million tonnes of freight were carried on inland waterways and
estuaries, covering some 2,400 million tonne-km (1-3 per cent of freight traffic
by tonne-km in Great Britain). About 46 per cent (in tonne-km) was carried in
the South East, mainly on the River Thames. Of the 3,200 km (2,000 miles) of
canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly owned British Waterways
Board, some 550 km (340 miles) are maintained as commercial waterways. The
Board also operates docks, warehouses and inland freight terminals. Freight
traffic on its waterways is conveyed by the private sector. In 1986—87 the Board's
turnover amounted to £19-6 million and it received government grants of £44-2
million to maintain its waterways to statutory standards.
Ports
There are over 300 ports in Great Britain, but many are small harbours of only
local significance and do not handle cargo regularly. Most port authorities
operate with statutory powers under private Acts of Parliament. They are of
three broad types: trusts, local authorities and statutory companies.
318
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Port Traffic
Major ports controlled by trusts include Clyde, Dover, Forth, London, Medway,
Milford Haven, and Tees and Hartlepool. Local authorities control many small
ports but also the much larger ports of Bristol, Portsmouth and the oil ports in
Orkney and Shetland.
Associated British Ports, established under the Transport Act 1981 as a
statutory corporation, wholly owned by Associated British Ports Holdings PLC (a
private sector company), owns and operates 19 ports including Southampton,
Grimsby and Immingham, Hull, Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. Other port
undertakings owned by statutory companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool and
Manchester.
In 1986 traffic through the ports of Great Britain amounted to 453 million
tonnes comprising 150 million tonnes of exports, 149 million tonnes of imports
and 154 million tonnes of domestic traffic (which included offshore traffic,
landings of sea-dredged aggregates and material shipped for dumping at sea).
About 61 per cent of the traffic was in fuels, mainly petroleum and petroleum
products. Some 72 per cent of the 12-8 million tonnes of traffic (9-7 million
tonnes of imports and 31 million tonnes of exports) which entered or left
Northern Ireland by sea in 1986 represented traffic with the rest of Britain.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total tonnage handled, are given in Table 36.
Offshore oil developments have had a substantial effect on port traffic by greatly
increasing the flow through certain North Sea ports, such as Tees and
Hartlepool and the Forth ports, creating oil ports at Flotta in Orkney and Sullom
Voe in Shetland, and reducing oil traffic at many traditional oil-importing
terminals. Two other significant changes have affected traffic at British ports in
the last 20 years. First, traditional major ports, such as London, Liverpool and
Manchester, have lost general (non-bulk) cargo traffic to ports like Dover and
Felixstowe which have developed specialised facilities to meet a world-wide
switch from conventional handling methods to container and roll-on modes.
While non-fuel traffic has been growing only slowly, container and roll-on traffic
has more than trebled since 1970 to 60 million tonnes in 1986 and now
accounts for about 70 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The leading ports for
container traffic are Felixstowe, London and Southampton and for roll-on traffic

are Dover (Britain’s leading seaport in terms of the value of trade handled),
Felixstowe, Grimsby and Immingham, and Harwich. Secondly, ports on the
south and east coasts have increasingly gained traffic at the expense of those on
the west coast as the emphasis of Britain's trade has switched towards the
continent of Europe.
Modernisation of Britain’s ports has been carried out primarily to accommodate
the growth in container and roll-on traffic, to speed the handling of bulk
commodities, and as a result of the changing nature and direction of Britain’s
trade. Many ports have modernised facilities and improved productivity by
changing port layout, introducing new handling equipment and reducing
manning levels. Most major new developments have been at east- and
south-coast ports. For example, at Felixstowe a £42 million container terminal,
completed in 1986, has raised the port's container-handling capacity by about
50 per cent. Extra capacity for feriy services is being provided at Dover,
Portsmouth and Ramsgate, and a new freight ferry terminal at Dartford on the
Thames began operations in 1986.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the British sector of the North Sea have
been built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe
(one of the largest oil terminals in the world). Three of the four jetties at Sullom
Voe can handle oil tankers of up to 350,000 deadweight tonnes, and the fourth
jetty handles the export of liquefied petroleum gases and can accommodate
vessels with a capacity of up to 75,000 cubic metres. A £54 million terminal at
Braefoot Bay in the Firth of Forth handles tankers carrying natural gas liquids
brought by pipeline from the plant at Mossmorran (Fife). Supply bases for
offshore vessels have been built at a number of ports, mostly on the east coast of
Scotland.
Shipping
In common with the fleets of other developed countries, the British fleet has
been adversely affected by the world recession in shipping and increasing
international competition. It has declined substantially from a peak of 53-4
million deadweight tonnes1 (33-7 million gross tonnage) in 1975 to 16-9 million
deadweight tonnes (11-6 million gross tonnage) in 1986. A large tonnage of
ships, particularly of tankers, has been scrapped or sold, while a number of
shipowners have transferred their fleets to overseas registries, although some of
these registries (such as Bermuda and the Isle of Man) are part of the British
registry system.
In July 1986, 14-2 million deadweight tonnes of trading vessels of 100 gross
tonnes and over were both owned and registered in Britain: 533 vessels totalling
6 million tonnes being usually employed as dry bulk cargo, liner or cellular
container ships; and a further 227 vessels of 8-2 million tonnes as oil, chemical
or gas carriers. The merchant fleet figure of 16-9 million deadweight tonnes also
includes non-trading vessels, such as fishing vessels, tugs and dredgers, and
shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.
British cargo liner tonnage is dominated by a relatively small number of large
private sector groups and container consortia. The representative body for the
majority of shipowners is the General Council of British Shipping, although
certain sectors have their own associations.
About 94 per cent of Britain's overseas trade by weight, 79 per cent by value, is
carried by sea, while the proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by
sea is more than one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s.
1 Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before submerging the
load-line. Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed space on a ship.

Ships registered in Britain carried 21 per cent by weight, 16 per cent in terms of
tonne-mileage and 36 per cent by value. Tanker cargoes accounted for over half
this trade by weight, but only 11 per cent by value, and foodstuffs and
manufactured goods accounted for three-quarters by value.
Many of the deep-sea liner services from Britain are operated by container
ships. There are many roll-on services, accommodating passengers and their
cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles, between Britain and the continent
of Europe and several freight-only roll-on services to the Irish Republic, the
continent of Europe, and to some more distant countries.
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with each
other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. Conferences serve all
the major trades to and from Britain. In 1985 Britain acceded to the United
Nations Convention for Liner Conferences, a code of conduct governing relations
among shipping companies that are members of conferences.
Almost all of the 26-8 million passengers who arrived at or departed from British
ports in 1986 travelled to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic.
Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for cruising and in 1986
some 54,000 passengers embarked on pleasure cruises from British ports.
Traffic from the southern and south-eastern ports accounts for a substantial
proportion of traffic to the continent of Europe. The main British operators are
Sealink UK Ltd and P and O.
Cross-Channel hovercraft services are provided by Hoverspeed Ltd (owned by
Sealink), which operates five hovercraft on routes between Dover and Boulogne,
and Dover and Calais. A hovercraft crossing takes about one-third of the time
taken by ships, and hovercraft carry about 15 per cent of the traffic on the
short-sea crossings to France.
Passenger and freight ferry services are also operated to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, Orkney, Shetland and a number of other
Scottish islands.
The Department of Transport is the government department responsible for
most matters connected with merchant shipping, including Britain’s relations
with other governments and international organisations on shipping matters.
The general policy is one of minimum intervention by the Government and the
encouragement of free and fair competition. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts
the Department does, however, administer many regulations for marine safety
and welfare, and for preventing and cleaning up pollution from ships. The Acts
also contain certain reserve powers for protecting shipping and trading interests
from measures adopted or proposed by overseas governments.
The first stage of a European Community shipping policy has involved
agreement by the Community's transport ministers in 1986 on four regulations.
These will liberalise the Community’s international trade, establish a competi¬
tion regime for shipping and enable the Community to take action to combat
protectionism from other countries and to counter unfair pricing practices.
The Coastguard Service, administered by the Department of Transport, is
responsible for initiating and co-ordinating civil marine search and rescue
action around Britain. It can call upon the lifeboats of the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution (a voluntary body which operates 262 lifeboats). Ministry of

long-range civilian helicopter based at Sumburgh (Shetland), and any other
ships or aircraft available to assist in search or rescue action. In 1986 the
Coastguard Service took action in 5,300 incidents (including cliff rescues) in
which over 8,960 people were assisted.
The lighthouse authorities (for England and Wales the Corporation of Trinity
House, for Scotland the Northern Lighthouse Board and for Ireland the
Commissioners of Irish Lights) control about 370 lighthouses, many minor
lights and buoys, and a number of lightships, some of which are being replaced
by unattended sea marks or by light towers. In Britain there are 49 pilotage
authorities for the 93 pilotage districts and about 1,300 licensed pilots. Trinity
House is the largest pilotage authority, licensing some 500 pilots in 40 districts
in England and Wales. In some cases the harbour authority (which may also be
the local council) is the pilotage authority. However, the Pilotage Act 1987
provides for the abolition of the pilotage authorities and for the transfer of their
responsibilities to harbour authorities.
Compliance with traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain is
mandatory for all vessels of countries party to the 1972 International Collision
Regulations. The most important scheme affecting British waters is in the Dover
Strait, the world’s busiest seaway. Britain and France operate radar surveillance
of the strait to keep watch on ships not conforming to the scheme and, through
the Channel Navigation Information Service, broadcast navigational informa¬
tion to ships in the strait.
Civil Aviation
Britain’s substantial civil air transport industry is continuing to develop to meet
the increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel. The
airline industry is the most rapidly growing other than that of the United States,
and the airlines are re-equipping their fleets with the most modern aircraft.
Many airports are being substantially modernised and expanded.
The Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with more than 100 other
countries, the licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain
by overseas operators and British participation in the activities of international
aviation bodies), airports policy, amenity matters (such as aircraft noise),
aviation security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims to encourage a sound and
competitive multi-airline industry in Britain, to promote competition in
international and internal services, and to maintain high standards of safety. It
has liberalised airline services within Britain, and in its negotiations with other
countries on bilateral air service agreements it is proposing the adoption of more
liberal measures. New agreements with a number of other members of the
European Community have already resulted in greater competition, leading to
increased traffic and lower fares. The Government has taken the lead in
encouraging airline competition within the Community, as a first step towards
meeting the Community’s objective that by 1992 air transport should be part of
a single internal market. The measures proposed would lead to much cheaper
off-peak fares and greater freedom for airlines in setting business fares.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body, respon¬
sible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry. It is
also responsible for air traffic control at certain British airports and, jointly with
the Ministry of Defence, for the provision by the National Air Traffic Services of
air navigation services. Members of the CAA board are appointed by the
Secretary of State for Transport.

Operations
British Airways
Other Airlines
Under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 its primary objectives are to ensure that
British airlines provide air services to satisfy all substantial categories of public
demand at the lowest charges consistent with a high standard of safety and an
economic return for efficient operators, and to further the reasonable interests
of air transport users. Other duties are to ensure that British airlines compete
effectively on international routes, to secure the most effective use of airports in
Britain, to have regard to the need to minimise the adverse effects of civil
aviation on the environment, and, under the Airports Act 1986, it has various
responsibilities for economic regulation of airport companies.
In 1986 a total of some 57-4 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers) to or from Britain, 8-5 per cent more than in 1985. In 1986
the value of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air was some £30,200 million and
the proportions carried by air amounted to approximately 21-5 per cent of the
value of exports and 16-8 per cent of imports. Air freight is important for the
carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially where speed of
movement is essential. Precious stones, live animals, medicinal and pharma¬
ceutical products, clothing, leather and skins, and scientific instruments are
major categories where a relatively high proportion of exports is sent by air.
Total capacity offered on all services by British airlines amounted to 14,243
million available-tonne-km in 1986: 10,655 million tonne-km on scheduled
services and 3,588 million tonne-km on non-scheduled services. The airlines
carry 25 million passengers a year on scheduled services and 20-2 million on
charter flights. With the sale by the Government of its shares in British Airways
in February 1987, the civil airline industry is entirely in the private sector.
British Airways Pic is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of
passengers carried on international scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1986—87 British Airways’ turnover was £3,263 million (including
£3,054 million from airline operations). Its route network, covering some
555,000 km (344,900 miles) of unduplicated scheduled route, is among the
largest in the world. The airline serves some 145 destinations in 68 countries
and in 1986 carried over 20 million passengers. International scheduled services
are operated to the rest of Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia,
East and South Africa, North America, South America and the Caribbean.
Within Britain it runs some 1,350 services a week to 14 towns and cities.
Scheduled Concorde supersonic services are operated from London (Heathrow)
to New York and to Miami via Washington, crossing the North Atlantic in about
half the time taken by subsonic aircraft. Its fleet of 163 aircraft in August 1987
comprised 34 Boeing 747s, 43 Boeing 737s, 25 Boeing 757s, 19 Lockheed
TriStars, 26 BAG One-Elevens, 9 HS 748s and 7 Concordes; 37 aircraft were on
order—17 Boeing 747s, 11 Boeing 767s and 9 Boeing 757s.
The other main scheduled airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates
a fleet of 26 aircraft and carried 2-4 million scheduled service passengers in
1986. Its scheduled services are primarily to the continent of Europe; North,
West and Central Africa; the United States; the Middle East; and Hong Kong.
British Airways has recently put in an offer for all the share capital of British
Caledonian, and this has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Other operators of scheduled passenger services include British Midland, Dan
Air Services, Air UK and Virgin Atlantic. Britannia Airways, Dan Air Services,
Monarch Airlines, Air Europe and Orion Airways are the leading airlines
operating charter passenger services.

Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work, but are mainly employed on the
large-scale operations connected with the development of Britain’s offshore oil
and gas resources. Light aircraft and helicopters are also involved in other
activities, such as charter operations, search and rescue services, crop¬
spraying, and aerial survey and photography. The two main helicopter operators
in Britain are Bristow Helicopters and British International Helicopters, with 65
and 29 helicopters respectively.
The CAA is responsible for air safety, both airworthiness and operational safety.
Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and application of safety
requirements concerning airline and private aviation operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Airworthi¬
ness Division is responsible for the airworthiness standards of aircraft
registered in Britain, the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers and the
approval of work schedules to which British transport aircraft are maintained.
Every company operating aircraft used for public transport must possess an
Air Operator’s Certificate, which is granted by the CAA when it is satisfied that
the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its aircraft. The CAA’s
flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline pilots) check that
satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Except for pilots with acceptable
military or other qualifying experience, all applicants for a first professional
pilot’s licence must have undertaken a full-time course of ground and flying
instruction which has been approved by the CAA.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). The
Controller of the NATS reports to both the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. At
some 19 civil aerodromes, including most of the major British airports, the
NATS provides the navigation services necessary for the operation of aircraft
taking off and landing, and integrates them into the flow of traffic within British
airspace. To provide its services, the NATS uses radar, some 100 navigational
beacons, landing aids, air/ground communications and an extensive telecom¬
munications network.
Of the 137 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, about one-fifth each handles
more than 100,000 passengers a year. Eleven handle over 1 million passengers a
year and these are shown in Table 37. In 1986 Britain’s civil airports handled a
total of 76-6 million passengers (75-2 million terminal passengers and 1-4
million in transit), and 881,000 tonnes of freight. London’s Heathrow airport is
the world’s busiest airport for international travel and is Britain’s most
important airport for passengers and air freight, handling 31-7 million
passengers and 537,000 tonnes of freight in 1986. Gatwick is the world’s second
busiest international airport.
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—are owned and
managed by BAA pic, the successor company to the statutory British Airports
Authority. Together they handle about 75 per cent of air passengers and 85 per
cent of air cargo traffic in Britain. The Government’s shares in BAA pic were sold
in July 1987.
Many of the other public airports are controlled by local authorities, and the
Act also provides for the larger airports—those with a turnover exceeding £1

By mid-1987, 13 major local authority airports were operating as companies
under the Companies Act 1985. The Government is encouraging the introduc¬
tion of private capital into the new companies.
Under the Airports Act 1986 the CAA has responsibility for the economic
regulation of major airport companies including the BAA pic airports and the
larger local authority airports. These powers will enable the CAA to take
appropriate steps to remedy practices considered to be against the public
interest, in particular any abuse of an airport’s monopoly position.
All airports used for public transport and training flights must be licensed by
the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of adequate fire¬
fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable physical characteristics and
visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is granted. Strict aviation security
measures are in force.
The Government’s policy is to promote a strong and competitive British airline
industry by providing airport capacity where it is needed and by making effective
use of existing resources, especially at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. It is
also encouraging the maximum use of regional airports.
A fourth major terminal at Heathrow was opened in 1986, raising the airport’s
capacity from 30 million to 38 million passengers a year. Gatwick’s current
capacity is some 16 million passengers a year, but the second terminal, the first
phase of which is due to open in 1988, will eventually raise this to 25 million
passengers. Following a public inquiry, planning permission was granted in
1985 for the expansion of Stansted airport to an eventual capacity of 15 million
passengers a year; in 1986 work began on the first phase, which would provide
capacity of some 7 million to 8 million passengers a year.
Facilities have also been improved at regional airports, with major terminal or
runway improvements undertaken at Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds/Bradford
and Newcastle upon Tyne airports. The Government is ready to assist in
developing further opportunities for new routes and services: it is encouraging
the development of Manchester as a ‘regional hub' airport and the airport’s
expansion will include a second terminal.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
325
BRITISH
TELECOM
Communications
The telecommunications services sector is one of the most rapidly growing of the
economy. The British Telecommunications Act 1981 separated the Post Office
into two corporations, one for postal and banking services and the other for
telecommunications (British Telecommunications, trading as British Telecom),
and provided for a limited relaxation of the statutory monopoly in telecom¬
munications. The Telecommunications Act 1984 strengthened competition in a
number of ways. It removed British Telecom's exclusive privilege of running
public telecommunications systems and instituted new arrangements requiring
those running telecommunications systems (including British Telecom) to be
licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. This authority may be
delegated to the Director General of Telecommunications. Under the terms of its
licence, British Telecom is required to provide a universal telecommunications
service throughout the country to meet all reasonable demands, to provide
services in rural areas and certain essential services, such as public emergency
services, public call box services and maritime emergency services. Mercury
Communications Ltd was licensed as the second national fixed-link operator; its
licence conditions reflect the expanding nature of its operations.
In 1982 a general licence for ‘value added network services’ was issued,
permitting a wide variety of commercial services (other than the basic service of
conveying or switching a message) to be run in competition with British
Telecom over the public telecommunications networks. The licence was the first
of its kind and has placed the British system among the most liberal in the
world. By early 1987 the Department of Trade and Industry had licensed over
200 operators offering some 800 services, ranging from viewdata and conference
calls to electronic mail and retrieval systems. The value of the market is
estimated at some £150 million a year. Further liberalisation of the licensing
arrangements for value added and data services has taken effect with the
introduction in April 1987 of a new, more liberal, class licence, which opens up
the provision of data services to full competition. The new licence contains
provisions on fair trading and on ‘Open Systems Interconnection’ (to facilitate
the interworking of the computer products of different manufacturers) in
furtherance of the Government’s commitment to provide for the adoption of the
latter in Britain. These provisions apply only to large operators, thus enabling
small companies to enter the market with the minimum of regulation necessary
to protect privacy and confidentiality.
The Office of Telecommunications, a non-ministerial government department
established under the Telecommunications Act 1984, is the independent
regulatory body for the telecommunications industry. It is headed by the
Director General of Telecommunications, whose functions are to ensure that
licensees comply with the conditions of their licences; to promote effective
competition in the telecommunications industry; to provide advice to the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on telecommunications matters; and
to investigate complaints about services. The Director General also has a duty to
promote the interests of consumers in respect of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services.
Under the 1984 Act British Telecom was reconstituted as a public limited
company and a majority of the ordinary voting shares were sold to private
investors in 1984. It has over 1 -4 million registered shareholders and 87 per cent
of its 230,000 employees are also shareholders.
British Telecom serves some 17-3 million residential and 4-3 million business
telephone customers. It operates one of the world s largest public telecom¬
munications networks, with over 22 million telephone exchange lines, more

than 110,000 telex connections, 77,700 public payphones and a wide range of
specialised voice, data, text and visual services. The inland telephone and telex
networks are fully automatic. International services are also highly developed,
and international direct dialling is available from any telephone line in Britain to
175 countries, representing 93 per cent of the world’s telephones. Automatic
telex service is available to over 200 countries.
In 1986—87 the company made a pre-tax profit of £2,067 million on a turnover
of £9,424 million. Expenditure on capital equipment and other assets totalled
£2,107 million, of which £500 million went on modernising exchanges with
digital equipment. About £180 million was spent on research and development.
British Telecom is investing some £1,000 million a year in the modernisation
and expansion of its network to meet the increasing demand for basic telephone
services and for more specialised services. By March 1987 the company had over
193,000 km (120,000 miles) of optical fibre cable laid in its trunk network in
Britain, accounting for some 50 per cent of the trunk network, a higher
proportion than any other world operator. There were more than 500 digital
exchanges in service. About half of its customers are served by modern local
exchanges of various types. The combination of digital exchange switching and
digital transmission techniques, using optical fibre cable and microwave radio
links, is substantially improving the quality of telephone service for residential
and business customers, as well as making possible a wider range of services
through the company’s main network.
British Telecom provides numerous facilities and services including a free
facility for emergency calls to the police, fire, ambulance, coastguard, lifeboat
and air—sea rescue services; a free directory inquiries service; and various other
chargeable operator-connected services, such as transfer charge and alarm calls.
The operator-handled Freefone service, enabling users to contact organisations
at the called customer’s cost, has been supplemented since mid-1985 by
automatic ‘LinkLine’ facilities, enabling callers to contact organisations any¬
where in Britain, either free or at local call rates.
British Telecom provides a number of customer-dialled recorded telephone
information services, now known as Guidelines, including Timeline (formerly
known as the Speaking Clock). The company also provides value-added recorded
services in various centres at higher call charges, and makes its network
facilities available for similar premium services provided by other organisations
operating under the general value added network services licence.
Under a public payphone service modernisation programme, costing some
£160 million, all public payphones have been equipped with push-button
equipment. A number of cashless call developments are being carried out
including the Cardphone service, using prepaid encoded cards, which was
initially introduced in main railway stations, airports and other heavily used
sites, but has been extended to many other parts of Britain. More than 7,000
cardphones are in service. There are over 300,000 rented payphones on
premises to which the public has access and these are also being upgraded with
modern push-button equipment.
Prestel, British Telecom’s public viewdata service, was the first of its kind to
enable a wide variety of computer-stored information to be called up on a special
television receiver via the telephone. By mid-1987 there were some 70,000
terminals attached to Prestel, 55 per cent in businesses and 45 per cent in
homes. Through its ‘Gateway’ links with other databases, a wide range of other
services, such as home shopping and banking services and holiday booking and
reservation facilities, has become available.

There has been rapid growth in British Telecom’s mobile communications
services including the jointly owned cellular radio network (see p 328). Its
radiopaging service is the largest of its kind in the world.
British Telecom International is the company’s division handling international
networks and services. It is the second largest shareholder in the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (of which 114 countries are
members) and in the International Maritime Satellite Organisation, with
interests in a number of other consortia.
A digital international telephone exchange is in service in London and two
more are on order. The world’s first international undersea optical fibre cable,
between Britain and Belgium, began operating in 1986 and by 1990 Britain will
be connected to a network of high-capacity undersea optical fibre cables. Work
will begin on laying the first transatlantic optical fibre cable (TAT 8) in
September 1987 and a further high-capacity transatlantic optical fibre cable
(TAT 9) should be in operation by 1991. This will have twin branches to Britain
and France from the main cable and will be the first to incorporate an undersea
junction.
By the end of March 1987 companies sending computer data world-wide from
Britain were able to use international ‘Packet SwitchStream’ services to 75
networks in 51 countries.
High-speed international satellite links to and from Britain are being
expanded. The main business systems terminal at British Telecom
International’s ‘Teleport’ earth station in London’s Docklands became oper¬
ational at the end of 1985 and ‘SatStream’ private circuit digital links, using
small-dish satellite earth stations, have been extended to cover North America
and Western Europe. An ‘International KiloStream’ service, offering digital
private circuits for voice, text and visual services, is available to the United
States, Australia and Japan.
Direct-dial maritime satellite services have been introduced for vessels
world-wide, and limited in-flight operator-controlled telephone call facilities
have been introduced via Portishead Radio Station near Bristol. Trials of an
automatic service via satellite for aircraft passengers will start in autumn 1987
prior to the introduction of the service on transatlantic routes in 1988 using
specially equipped British Airways aircraft.
Digital transmission techniques have been introduced for services to the
United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia via the Madley earth station
near Hereford. The service to Japan includes the world’s first wholly digital
intercontinental public telephone service, giving faster connections and clearer
speech.
British Telecom’s overseas consultancy service, Telconsult, was engaged on
150 projects in 60 countries during 1986—87.
Mercury Communications Ltd, a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless pic, operates
under licence as the second telecommunications carrier in Britain, enabling the
company to offer a wide range of services, both nationally and internationally. A
900-km (560-mile) trunk network has been established, centred on Birming¬
ham, linking major cities including London, Bristol, Manchester and Sheffield,
with microwave spurs in operation or planned to connect the network to
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Wales and the south coast of England. The
network uses digital high-quality communications techniques, based on optical
fibre cable laid alongside railway tracks. Services to business customers began
in 1986, and services for small businesses and residential customers became
available in Derby and Nottingham in April 1987 and have been extended to a
number of other areas from summer 1987. Mercury also provides an increasing

range of enhanced services including telex, packet data services, electronic
messaging, wide-area radiopaging and message switching. In May 1987 it
launched Europe’s first ‘Centrex’ service, which will enable business customers
to have all the facilities normally available on private automatic branch
exchanges obtainable instead from equipment located at Mercury’s public
exchanges.
International services are provided by two satellite communications centres in
London’s Docklands and Oxfordshire, serving North America, Australia,
Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. Mercury’s international links will
include a new private transatlantic optical fibre cable, due to enter service in
mid-1989, which will form part of the ‘global digital highway’ planned by Cable
and Wireless.
By mid-1987 ten companies had been licensed to run local broadband cable
systems. At present they mainly provide television programmes, but some will
also provide interactive services, including voice telephony services (which will
have to be provided in co-operation with British Telecom or Mercury).
The Government has taken two major initiatives to encourage the expansion of
mobile radio telecommunications services. First, Racal Vodafone Ltd (part of the
Racal Electronics Group) and Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd (a joint
venture between British Telecom and Securicor) have been licensed to run
competing national cellular radio telephone systems, which started in 1985 and
are now available to over 80 per cent of the population of Britain. By 1987 the
companies had invested £200 million in establishing their networks, and
further substantial investment is being undertaken to provide increased
capacity to meet the rapidly growing demand from cellular radio telephone
users, estimated at some 170,000 in mid-1987. Secondly, Britain is co¬
operating in the development of common standards and technical specifications
for a European digital cellular radio telephone network, which is expected to be
introduced in 1991.
In the non-cellular sector, parts of the radio spectrum have been reallocated
for use by two national and a number of regional private mobile radio operators,
which are expected to inaugurate their services later in 1987. A number of other
frequencies have been released for use by five national wide-area radiopaging
operators.
Cable and Wireless pic provides or manages a wide range of telecommunications
activities, mostly overseas in nearly 50 countries. Its main business is the
provision and operation of public telecommunications services of 36 countries
and territories under franchises granted by the governments concerned, while it
also provides and manages telecommunications services and facilities for public
and private sector customers, and undertakes consultancy work. It owns,
operates or has been a consultant on over 40 satellite earth stations, and owns a
fleet of seven cableships for laying and maintaining submarine telecommunica¬
tions cables.
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered postal services and was the first to
issue adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. The Royal
Mail provides deliveries to 23-5 million addresses and handles 46 million letters
and parcels each working day (over 12,000 million items a year). Mail is collected
from over 100,000 posting boxes, as well as from post offices and large postal
users. The Post Office has a monopoly on the conveyance of letters, but under
the British Telecommunications Act 1981 the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry has the power to suspend the monopoly in certain areas or for certain

categories of mail and to license others to provide competing services. The
Secretary of State has relaxed the monopoly on letters subject to a minimum fee
of £1, and has issued general licences enabling mail to be transferred between
document exchanges and allowing charitable organisations to carry Christmas
and New Year cards.
All the 80 offices equipped with mechanical handling equipment are in
operation and are gradually taking over the work of hundreds of sorting offices
handling letters manually. Each address in Britain has a postcode and the
British system is the most sophisticated in the world, allowing mechanised
sorting down to part of a street on a postman’s round and, in some cases, to an
individual address. Some 31 large parcel centres, each serving a group of
counties, have taken over the work of 1,200 offices which handled parcels
manually.
As well as postal and Girobank services, post offices handle a wide range of
transactions. In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for
government departments and local authorities. The Post Office is introducing
new technology into its counter services to reduce costs and raise productivity,
while providing an improved range of services to customers. There are nearly
22,000 post offices, of which some 1,500 are operated directly by the Post Office
and the remainder on an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
The Post Office provides a range of specialist services. Datapost, a door-to-door
delivery service, has overnight links throughout Britain and provides an
international service to 90 countries. ‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid
delivery within or between more than 100 cities and towns in Britain. ‘Intelpost’,
the world’s first international public facsimile transmission service sending
letters and other documents electronically, provides high-speed mail links
between more than 100 post offices in Britain as well as to and from 32 other
countries. The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh handles about one-third of the
Post Office’s philatelic business, much of it involving sales to overseas collectors
or dealers. The British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance
on all aspects of postal business to overseas postal administrations, and nearly
40 countries have used its services since 1965.

16 Employment
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force with high levels of
technical and commercial skill. However, in common with other industrialised
countries, it has suffered in recent years from high levels of unemployment,
although this has been falling for more than a year. The Government has taken a
number of steps to improve the operation of the labour market with the aim of
creating the most suitable economic climate in which business can flourish and
create more jobs. These include increasing the flexibility of the labour market,
removing burdens on employers and making training more relevant to the
economy’s needs.
TRENDS IN
THE LABOUR
MARKET
The total workforce in June 1986 was 27-8 million, of whom 21-6 million (11-9
million men and nearly 9-7 million women) were classed as employees in
employment (see Table 38). Britain has one of the highest proportions of people
of working age in jobs or seeking work among all the major industrialised
countries, and the employed labour force (which rose by over 1 million between
March 1983 and the end of 1986) is continuing to grow as the population of
working age increases and as more women look for work. Recent trends have
included the continuing growth in the proportion of the workforce accounted for
by women, as more married women have sought work, especially in parLtime
employment; and a substantial increase in self-employment. Between 1979 and
1986 the number of self-employed people is estimated to have risen by 40 per
cent to 2-6 million, representing 9-5 per cent of the working population.
Pattern of There have been substantial changes in the nature and location of employment.
Employment with a marked shift, as in other industrialised countries, from manufacturing to
service industries. Between 1955 and 1986 the proportion of employees in
employment engaged in service industries rose from 45 per cent to 67 per cent as
higher living standards and technological developments stimulated the growth
of many service industries. During the period 1978 to 1986 the number of
employees in service industries rose by 1-3 million (10 per cent) to 14-5 million
(see Table 39). Employment in most service industries, with some exceptions,
such as transport, has grown considerably. The largest rise in this period was in
the banking, finance and insurance sector (by 40 per cent to 2-2 million), while
other sectors with significant increases included hotels and catering (22 per
cent), wholesale distribution and repairs (10 per cent), and medical and other
health services (9 per cent). Manufacturing industry accounted for 40 per cent of
employees in employment in 1955, but by 1986 the proportion had fallen to 24
per cent. Between 1978 and 1986 employment in manufacturing fell by 28 per
cent to 5-2 million. Nearly all manufacturing industries have experienced a
decline in employment as markets for manufactured goods have changed and as
new technology has brought greater efficiency and, in some cases, reduced the
demand for labour.
Unemploy- Britain, like most other industrialised countries, has been affected by relatively
ment high levels of unemployment during the 1980s. However, unemployment

reached its peak in 1986 when, on a seasonally adjusted basis (excluding
school-leavers), it totalled over 3-2 million in June, 11-6 per cent of the working
population. Subsequently there has been a significant decline in unemployment
and by August 1987 it had fallen to 2-8 million, 10-2 per cent of the working
population. The highest levels of unemployment have been concentrated in
areas with the greatest dependence on traditional manufacturing industries,
but the recent fall in unemployment has occurred in most regions.

The Government’s employment strategy is to maintain an economic, financial
and industrial climate in which businesses can operate successfully and create
jobs. It is taking action to improve the labour market by encouraging better
training, removing regulatory barriers which hinder recruitment by firms, and
providing an extensive range of employment and training measures for those
most affected by unemployment (particularly the long-term unemployed and the
young) to help them into productive work.
In 1987—88 expenditure on the Government’s employment and training
measures is planned to reach £3,100 million and over 1 million opportunities
will be available on employment and training schemes—for a description of
youth training and adult training measures, see pp 336—8.
The Enterprise Allowance Scheme, introduced for an experimental period in
1982 and extended to the whole of Great Britain in 1983, helps unemployed
people wishing to start their own business but who would be deterred by the
prospect of losing unemployment or supplementary benefit once they began.
Entrants, who must have at least £1,000 to invest in the business, receive an
allowance of £40 a week for a year while they start the business. Over 254,000
people have benefited from the scheme. Provision for the scheme has been
increased, to some £200 million in 1987—88, and the number of places available
will rise to 102,500 in 1987—88 and 110,000 in 1988—89, compared with some
60,000 in 1985—86. During 1986—87 enhanced advice training and counselling

a In June 1986 employment in the main sectors of manufacturing industry included 766,000 in office machinery,
electrical engineering and instruments: 731,000 in mechanical engineering: 577,000 in textiles, leather, footwear
and clothing: 572,000 in food, drink and tobacco: 497,000 in timber, wooden furniture, rubber and plastics;
480,000 in paper products, printing and publishing; 347,000 in chemicals and man-made fibres; and 255,000 in
motor vehicles and parts.
Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
arrangements were introduced to improve the survival, growth and job
generation prospects of businesses started under the scheme.
The Community Programme provides up to a year’s employment for long-term
unemployed adults and aims to improve their prospects. Projects undertaken
involve work of benefit to local communities and are run by sponsoring bodies,
primarily local authorities or voluntary organisations, but with funds provided
by the Government. The programme has expanded significantly and by March
1987 had some 244,000 participants engaged on about 12,000 projects. In
1986—87 over £1,000 million was spent on the programme.
In Northern Ireland similar assistance for the long-term unemployed is
provided through the Action for Community Employment scheme and Enter¬
prise Ulster, which together provided an average of some 7,350 jobs throughout
1986—87 at a cost of some £36 million.
‘Jobclubs’, introduced in 1985, are a further way in which unemployed people
are being helped to obtain work, by providing people with coaching and expert
advice on job-seeking techniques and by providing free facilities (such as
stationery, stamps and the use of telephones and typewriters) to enable them to
undertake an intensive search for a job. About 60 per cent of people leaving

Jobclubs enter employment. By March 1987 some 1,000 Jobclubs were in
operation, of which over half were located at jobcentres’, and the remainder
were run by a range of private sector organisations, voluntary bodies and local
enterprise agencies; the number of Jobclubs is being expanded.
The Job Release Scheme enables older workers (disabled men aged 60 to 63,
men aged 64 and women aged 59) to retire early with an allowance provided that
their employer replaces them with an unemployed person. Since its establish¬
ment in 1977 some 310,000 workers have taken early retirement under the
scheme.
Various initiatives to help the long-term unemployed have been undertaken.
Under the Restart Programme, in-depth interviews were carried out at job-
centres between July 1986 and March 1987 for everyone unemployed for a year
or more, while in nine pilot areas interviews were held with people unemployed
for six months or more. Interviewees were encouraged to identify any particular
problems which had hindered their search for employment and to consider a
range of opportunities. These included a place on the Community Programme,
an introduction to the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, training courses including
the new Job Training Scheme (see p 337), a place in a Jobclub, voluntary work,
a place on a one-week Restart course designed to improve motivation and assist
with job-hunting techniques, and a referral for more specialist help, for
example, from a Disablement Resettlement Officer.
From March 1987 Restart has been extended, so that everyone after being
unemployed for six months is required to attend a Restart interview, and an
interview is then available every six months. By April 1987, 1-3 million people
had been interviewed and it is estimated that about 2-6 million interviews will be
held in 1987—88.
Another feature of Restart is the Jobstart Allowance, of £20 a week, which is
available for up to six months to eligible long-term unemployed applicants who
accept a full-time job with gross pay of less than £80 a week. Its purpose is to
encourage long-term unemployed people, particularly those on high levels of
benefit, to take jobs which they might not have considered otherwise. Over
8,000 people received the allowance in 1986—87 and it is expected that 24,000
will obtain it in 1987—88.
Other schemes include the Voluntary Projects Programme (with a similar
Community Volunteering Scheme in Northern Ireland), which allows unem¬
ployed people to take voluntary work without losing entitlement to state
benefits; the Community Industry Scheme, which provides temporary job
opportunities for personally and socially disadvantaged young unemployed
people aged 17 to 19; the New Workers Scheme, introduced in 1986 to
complement the extended Youth Training Scheme by giving employers a
financial incentive to recruit those aged 18 to 20 at wages reflecting their relative
inexperience; and Jobshare, which is designed to encourage employers to create
part-time jobs for unemployed people.
In Great Britain responsibility for employment policy and for the payment of
unemployment benefit rests with the Department of Employment, while advice
on manpower policy issues is provided by the Manpower Services Commission
(MSC), a body on which employers, trade unions, local authorities and
educational interests are represented. The MSC is separate from the Govern¬
ment but accountable to the Secretaries of State for Employment, Scotland and
Wales. Most of its activities are financed from public funds. It is advised by a

network of area manpower boards on which employers, employees and other
local interests are represented.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
operated through a network of about 1,000 local jobcentres which handle all
except professional, scientific, technical and managerial occupations. Responsi¬
bility for running jobcentres will be transferred from the MSC to the Department
of Employment in October 1987. Facilities for job-seekers are being increased,
with a number of new small jobcentres being located in libraries and local
authority establishments. New technology is helping to provide job-seekers with
direct access through computer terminals to information on training and
employment.
Registration for employment is voluntary for all unemployed people aged over
18, whether or not they wish to claim benefits, while those aged under 18 are
required to register at the careers service as a condition of claiming benefit. In
the year to March 1987, 2-6 million vacancies were notified and 1-9 million
people were placed in employment (including job-seekers who were placed in a
job more than once during the year).
In Northern Ireland the Department of Economic Development’s Employment
Service, through its network of 28 ‘jobmarkets’, provides a guidance and
placement service for all age groups, offering a range of services for employers
and employees, as in Great Britain. Its facilities include Jobclubs and Restart
courses. A computerised vacancy information system is planned to be intro¬
duced in jobmarkets in 1988.
The public employment service provides a resettlement service to disabled
people. Disablement Resettlement Officers give practical help in job placement to
individuals with disabilities, as well as advising on rehabilitation and training
courses and on the comprehensive range of special schemes available. The
Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 requires employers who employ 20 or
more people to include 3 per cent registered disabled people within their
workforce. The Disablement Advisory Service gives employers advice and
guidance on making full use of the skills and abilities of disabled workers, by
adopting appropriate employment practices. As part of the ‘Fit for Work’
campaign to improve the employment prospects of disabled people, a scheme of
annual awards for firms which excel in carrying out constructive policies on the
employment of people with disabilities is run by the MSC; this will become the
responsibility of the Department of Employment.
The MSC runs a network of 27 Employment Rehabilitation Centres, which
provide courses designed to improve physical capacity, restore confidence and
guide participants towards the type of work or training that would be most likely
to lead to a permanent job. Three experimental Assistance towards Employment
Centres have also been set up to provide vocational assessment, counselling,
jobsearch training and a placement service. Sheltered employment for the
severely disabled is provided in Great Britain by Remploy Ltd and in Northern
Ireland by Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd, both non-profit-distributing
companies, and by some local authorities and voluntary bodies.
Professional and Executive Recruitment, a specialist branch of the MSC, will be
transferred to the Department of Employment in October 1987. On a fee-paying
basis it helps employers looking for professional, managerial, scientific or
technical staff and assists people seeking employment at this level. It operates
nationally, through a network of offices, and offers a comprehensive recruitment
service based on a weekly jobs newspaper which is issued to all enrolled
job-seekers, for whom the service is free. In Northern Ireland the Professional

and Executive Personnel Service is part of the general employment service
offered by jobmarkets.
Careers Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 local education authorities must
Service provide a careers service to include vocational guidance for people attending all
educational institutions (except universities, which have their own careers
service) and an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities may also
provide an employment service, mainly for young people in their early
post-school years.
The careers services in Wales and Scotland are the responsibility of the
respective Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland it is an integral part of the
Department of Economic Development.
The MSC Careers and Occupational Information Centre publishes material to
help people looking for jobs to make an informed choice, and distributes careers
literature to some 15,000 schools, careers offices and other centres.
TRAINING
SERVICES
Development
of Youth
Training
Over half of the occupational training in Britain is carried out and funded by
employers. Statutory industrial training boards operate in seven industries to
ensure adequate training by raising a levy from employers and disbursing
grants for approved training. The majority of boards may exempt employers
whose training is satisfactory from payment of most of the levy. In other
industries, non-statutory training bodies, membership of which is voluntary,
take responsibility for the development and encouragement of training.
The Government funds training through the MSC, which has developed a
comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply of trained manpower
needed by the economy, to provide opportunities for people to acquire new skills,
and to improve the effectiveness of training generally. Its strategy is based on
three important objectives: better arrangements for skill training to agreed
standards; improving the vocational education and training of all young people; j
and opening up more opportunities for adults to train.
The Youth Training Scheme, introduced in Great Britain in 1983, was expanded
in 1986 so that it now offers two years of training for 16-year-old school-leavers
(including at least 20 weeks off-the-job training) and one year for 17-year-old
school-leavers, with a minimum of seven weeks off-the-job training. The scheme
is primarily employer-based and is open to both employed and unemployed
young people. All trainees have the opportunity to obtain a vocational
qualification or credit towards such a qualification, and receive a certificate
recording their training experience and any qualifications. Broadly based
training is provided in the first year, with more specific training thereafter. In
1987—88 about 370,000 people are expected to enter the two-year programme
and by 1988—89, when it is fully in operation, about 440,000 people are likely to
be in training at any one time, up to 200,000 more than under the original
programme. Government funding is planned to rise from £929 million in
1986—87 to £1,055 million in 1987—88 and to £1,140 million by 1989—90.
In Northern Ireland the Youth Training Programme (YTP), launched in 1982
and administered jointly by the Northern Ireland Department of Economic
Development and the Department of Education, caters for the vocational,
education and training needs of those aged 16 or 17. It offers a two-year
programme to 16-year-old school-leavers, with the first year involving off-the-job
training, further education and work experience. The second year is spent in
employment with training (under the ‘YTP Workscheme') or in more specialised,
project-based full-time training; 17-year-old school-leavers may participate for
one year in either the YTP Workscheme or a full-time training scheme. In

1987-88 the YTP will provide some 9,400 full-time training places, while
provision is also made for up to 5,000 entrants on the YTP Workscheme.
The Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, administered by the MSC
in Great Britain in co-operation with local education authorities, is intended to
stimulate the provision of technical and vocational education for 14- to
18-year-olds. Projects provide an integrated course of full-time education lead¬
ing to nationally recognised qualifications. Most education authorities are
operating or have applied to run such schemes, and by mid-1987, 95 projects
were in operation, covering some 65,000 students. The results of these pilot
projects have been encouraging, and the initiative will be extended from
September 1987 to give all those in full-time education aged between 14 and 18
the opportunity to experience the wider curriculum available.
Following the report of a review group, a major reform of the system of vocational
qualifications is being implemented. A new national framework of such
qualifications, to be called the National Vocational Qualification, will be fully
operational in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 1991. A National Council
for Vocational Qualifications has been set up and will be responsible for
developing and monitoring the framework and accrediting qualifications of
bodies offering awards within it. Scotland is not involved in the system at
present, as its framework has already been reformed, through its ‘16+ Action
Plan’.
The MSC's adult training programmes have been restructured to provide help
for a substantially greater number of people, and training has been more closely
directed towards the skills needed by employers. The number participating in
the adult training programmes rose from some 100,000 in 1983—84 to over
450,000 in 1986-87.
Its most recent programme, for retraining and updating the skills of
unemployed people, is the new Job Training Scheme. When fully operational, it
will provide 250,000 training opportunities a year for people who have been
unemployed for six months or more. Priority is being given to those aged under
25, with the aim being for the trainee to obtain a recognised vocational
qualification. Training is carried out by colleges, private training providers and
at the nationwide network of 60 skillcentres under the control of the MSC’s
Skills Training Agency. About 500 courses are available in a wide range of
occupations. Greater emphasis is being given to training for those running or
hoping to start small businesses. The MSC's Training for Enterprise Scheme,
which has been considerably expanded, offers short, practical courses in basic
business management skills to those who want to become self-employed or are
running small businesses.
The MSC also provides support to encourage employers' training efforts to
help improve the skills of the workforce and to develop more and better training.
A programme of local grants to employers provides help for training employers’
workforces or new recruits, and the National Priority Skills Scheme is run
through industrial training organisations to help to tackle key skill needs. The
adult training strategy aims to develop a better and more responsive training
system, by using its own training programmes to demonstrate to employers and
individuals the benefits of good training and by encouraging training providers
to be responsive to labour market needs and modern training methods. The
Skills Training Agency provides a wide range of training services to employers,
designed to equip selected employees with new or improved skills of direct and
immediate benefit to their companies. This training, specially tailored to the
employer’s needs, is carried out either at a skillcentre or on the company’s own
premises, using the Agency’s Mobile Training Service. The Agency also provides

training for overseas clients, either training students in Britain or sending
instructors abroad.
Training for unemployed people in basic work-related skills is available under
the Wider Opportunities Training Programme. The programme is aimed at
those groups at a disadvantage in the labour market, such as ethnic minorities,
women returning to work, and people with limited English or with literacy and
numeracy difficulties. A pilot training loans scheme, designed to encourage
adults to undertake vocational training of their choice, was launched for a
three-year period in 1986.
Increased use of open learning methods and materials is being supported
through the Open Learning Programme, with the aim of making vocational
training available to everyone who can benefit from it in a form which can be
adapted to meet their own study circumstances. By April 1987, over 50,000
people had participated in the Open Tech Programme, which ran for five years
from April 1982 and was directed at technicians, supervisors and managers.
The availability of ‘distance' learning will be extended when the Open College,
which will provide courses below degree level to help people to improve their
vocational competence, begins broadcasting in September 1987. The College is a
company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity. Its aim is to reach an
audience of up to 1 million students in its first five years.
Employment protection legislation provides a number of safeguards for em¬
ployees. For example, most employees are entitled to receive from their
employers written information on their terms and conditions of employment,
while minimum periods of notice when employment is to be terminated are laid
down for both employers and employees. Employees with a minimum period of
service of two years are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs
cease to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or a fall in
demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost
being partly met from a fund subscribed to by both sides of industry. Protection
against unfair dismissal is provided by machinery under which an employee
who has been in continuous employment, normally for two years or more, may
complain against an employer of unfair dismissal, and, if successful, obtain
reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation. Other rights for employees
include limited payment when work is not available for reasons other than as a
result of a strike, lock-out or other industrial action, and maternity rights for
female employees. However, the Government is keeping under review the
legislation affecting terms and conditions of employment. Its aim is to ensure
that the obligations placed on employers do not involve significant costs which
discourage recruitment.
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached the
statutory minimum school-leaving age (16).
In general, people coming to Britain for employment need a work permit issued
by the Department of Employment. Among other conditions, work permits are
issued only for work requiring a recognised professional qualification, or a high
degree of skill or experience, where the Department is satisfied that the worker
is necessary and there is no suitable worker in Britain or in other European
Community countries to fill the post. In general, the age limits for permits in
most categories are 23 to 54 years. People coming for certain kinds of specialist
employment (for example, ministers of religion and representatives of the
overseas media) and the self-employed do not require work permits but may
require entry clearances issued by a British Consulate or High Commission.
Permits are also issued under the Training and Work Experience Scheme for

nationals of countries outside the European Community who are undertaking
limited periods of training or work experience leading to the acquisition of a
particular skill or qualification and to young people from outside the European
Community to undertake short periods of employment to broaden their work
experience and, if appropriate, to improve their knowledge of English.
European Community workers entering another member state have the same
rights as nationals of that state as regards facilities of the national employment
services, pay and conditions, trade union rights, vocational training facilities,
access to housing, and social security and industrial injury benefits.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of
colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters. The Department of Employment
operates a Race Relations Employment Advisory Service with advisers based in
the main areas where there are large ethnic minority communities. Its general
aim is to promote equal opportunity in employment and its advisers offer help
and guidance to employers and unions on a wide range of issues which arise in
the employment of a multiracial workforce. The Commission for Racial
Equality’s code of practice gives practical guidance to employers and others on
the best arrangements for implementing policies to eliminate racial discrimina¬
tion and to enhance equality of opportunity.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes it unlawful to discriminate on the
grounds of sex or of being married in employment, training and related matters.
The employment provisions were amended by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986,
to bring British legislation fully into line with a European Community directive
on equal treatment. The Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, requires that
a woman doing the same or broadly similar work as a man, or work which has an
equal value, should receive equal pay and conditions of employment.
Pay rates are often determined by national collective bargaining (see p 345),
normally on an annual basis. However, the Government’s view is that pay
determination should increasingly be conducted at local level and should depend
primarily on performance, merit, company profitability and local supply and
demand for labour. In March 1987 the Government announced that it would
introduce a new income tax relief for employees receiving profit-related pay
under registered schemes; it is expected that this will lead to a greater degree of
pay flexibility.
Basic rates of pay vary widely, and in private industry rates paid locally often
exceed the rates specified in national agreements. Higher rates are usually paid
for overtime and shift work, and weekly earnings may be further increased by
incentive bonus schemes.
According to the latest available information from the Department of
Employment’s New Earnings Survey, the average weekly earnings (including
overtime payments) in April 1986 of full-time employees on adult rates were
£184-70 (£207-50 for men and £137-20 for women). Earnings were higher for
non-manual employees (£200-90) than for manual employees (£163-20). Some
49 per cent of manual employees and 19 per cent of non-manual employees
received overtime payments. Women’s earnings are markedly lower than those of
men, partly because on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid
at premium rates, and partly because they tend to be concentrated in the less
well-paid jobs.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £15,000 to £30,000 a year gross before tax.

The posts with salaries above £30,000 a year include those of Cabinet ministers,
top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in government depart¬
ments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers,
leading members of professions and the higher managerial posts in industry,
commerce and banking. A number of company directors have salaries exceeding
£100,000 a year and some other people, such as leading pop musicians and
other star entertainers, may receive similar amounts through fees, royalties or
fixed contracts.
The basic working week in Great Britain is in the range 37-5 to 40 hours for
manual work and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually
worked. Actual hours worked differ from basic hours; in April 1986 for full-time
employees they were 41-8 for men compared with 37-3 for women. Men and
women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than manual
employees.
Legislation limits the permissible hours of work for young people. Hours of
work of adult men and of women in non-industrial jobs are not restricted by
statute. In February 1987, under the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, restrictions
on the maximum hours of women employed in industrial undertakings were
repealed, so that they are able to work the same hours as men, except that they
are prohibited from undertaking work at night. However, most industrial
establishments are eligible to apply for exemption orders, which allow women to
work at night.
There are no general statutory entitlements to holidays, and holiday entitle¬
ments are frequently determined by collective agreements. These generally
provide for at least four weeks’ paid holiday a year, and over 85 per cent of
manual employees covered by national collective agreements have entitlements
of more than four weeks, with nearly one-quarter having five weeks or more.
Non-manual workers tend to have longer holidays than manual workers. Holiday
entitlements may also be dependent upon length of service.
Some firms operate profit-sharing and share-saving schemes, and the Govern¬
ment has taken a number of measures to encourage the development of
employee share ownership schemes. The number of schemes open to all
employees in a company has risen from less than 30 in 1979 to over 1,300 in
1987, and 1-5 million employees have benefited under them.
Additional benefits exist in varying degrees. About half of employees in
employment are covered by pension schemes provided by their employers. Many
employees are also covered by occupational sick pay schemes which are
additional or complementary to the state schemes, and by schemes to provide
private medical treatment. A smaller number are covered by schemes for
redundancy payments above the statutory minimum. Such benefits are more
usual among clerical and professional employees receiving a standard salary
than among manual workers. The provision of low-priced meals at the place of
employment is usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones.
Many offices and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their
staff have adopted luncheon voucher schemes. Among the other executive fringe
benefits sometimes available are company cars, life assurance, free medical
insurance, telephone allowances and low-interest loans.
Trade unions have members in virtually every occupation and represent nearly
half the working population. As well as negotiating pay and other terms and

conditions of employment with employers, they provide certain benefits and
services—for example, educational facilities, legal advice and benefit payments
during industrial disputes—which vary from union to union. Trade unions vary
widely in the composition of their membership, and may be organised either by
occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed) or
by industry, while some are based on a combination of both.
At the end of 1985 the total membership of British trade unions was about
10-8 million, of whom 81 per cent were in the 24 largest unions with over
100,000 members. During the 1980s there has been a decline in trade
unionism, primarily reflecting the movement in the economy away from
manufacturing (which has a relatively high level of union membership). The
number of unions has also fallen as there has been an increase in mergers, and a
number of small unions and of long-established craft unions have been
absorbed by larger unions. At the end of 1986 there were 375 trade unions on
the list maintained by the Certification Officer under the Employment Protec¬
tion Act 1975. To be eligible for entry on the list a trade union must show that it
consists wholly or mainly of workers and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and employers, or between workers and
employers’ associations. Certain rights and privileges are reserved for indepen¬
dent trade unions.
Among the largest unions are the Transport and General Workers Union (1-4
million members), the Amalgamated Engineering Union (975,000) and the
General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (827,000); of the
non-manual workers' unions, the largest are the National and Local Government
Officers' Association (752,000 members) and the National Union of Public
Employees (664,000).
The central organisation of most unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by a secret ballot of the individual members of the union
and responsible to the annual conference of delegates from local branches.
Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of unions, and carry
out policy decisions made by the conference delegates. Most unions also have
regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual member there
are local branches, covering one or more workplaces. The organising of members
in individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
management at the workplace, may be done by full-time district officials of the
union, or, in many cases, by workplace representatives, often called ‘shop
stewards’, who are chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to
represent them. Where two or more unions have members in the same
workplace, representatives’ or shop stewards’ committees may be formed to
discuss matters of common concern.
A number of trade unions are affiliated to the Labour Party and some sponsor
Members of Parliament. Any trade union wishing to use money for ‘political
objects’ (usually for party political purposes) must set up a separate fund,
subject to special rules, one of which must allow any member who objects to
contributing to the fund to opt out. Some 5-7 million members contribute
to a political fund and at the end of 1986, 44 unions maintained such a
fund.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUG), which was founded in 1868. The TUC’s objects are to promote
the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 88
trade unions which together represent 9-5 million people, or nearly 90 per cent
of all trade unionists in Britain, and it exercises power through influence rather
than through sanctions. The TUG deals with all general questions which
342
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
concern trade unions, both nationally and internationally, and provides a forum
in which affiliated unions can collectively determine policy. It is consulted by
the Secretary of State for Employment before the appointment of employee
representatives on the Manpower Services Commission, the Advisory, Con¬
ciliation and Arbitration Service and certain other official bodies with an
interest in employment matters. There are eight TUC regional councils for
England, and a Wales Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists. A General Council represents it between Congresses and is
responsible for carrying out Congress decisions, watching economic and social
developments, providing educational and advisory services to unions, and
presenting to the Government the trade union viewpoint on economic, social
and industrial issues. The TUC is also empowered to mediate in inter-union
disputes in certain circumstances, and uses its authority to try to resolve such
difficulties.
The TUC, as well as many individual unions, conducts extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade union¬
ism, and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers’ i
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
Scotland and
Northern
Ireland
Legal
Framework
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, which in many respects is similar in constitution and
function to the TUC. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the :
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU),
although the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions
based in Great Britain. Over 75 per cent of Northern Ireland trade unionists are j
members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority belong to
unions which are also affiliated to the TUC. The Northern Ireland Committee of
the ICTU has no political affiliations and enjoys a high degree of autonomy.
The beginnings of the present law on industrial relations were established a
century ago, when trade union members were freed from liability to charges of
criminal conspiracy. At the beginning of the present century unions were given
a wide degree of immunity from legal action under the civil law, and the 1
immunities of those organising industrial action were also strengthened.
Peaceful picketing during strikes was also made legal.
The Employment Acts 1980 and 1982 were designed to obtain a better balance
between rights and responsibilities in industrial relations. The 1980 Act
enabled the Government to make funds available to encourage the wider use of
secret union ballots and to produce codes of practice to promote good industrial
relations. It limited lawful picketing to the picket’s own place of work and
restricted the scope for secondary action such as blacking and sympathetic
strikes. It provided greater protection for the individual working in a ‘closed
shop' (that is, under an agreement between the employer and one or more
unions that union membership is a condition of employment) and removed legal
protection from any new closed shop which had not been approved in a secret
ballot by 80 per cent of the employees affected. As provided for in the Act, the
Government has published codes of practice on the conduct of picketing and the
closed shop.
The 1982 Act was designed to carry the process further. It increased the
compensation for employees unfairly dismissed for non-membership or
EMPLOYMENT
343
Government
Proposals
membership of a union and introduced compensation (from government funds)
for certain employees dismissed because of non-membership of a union in a
closed shop between 1974 and 1980. The Act also removed, from November
1984, legal protection from all closed shops (not only from new ones, as in the
1980 Act) where the closed shop had not been supported in a secret ballot held in
the previous five years by 80 per cent of the employees affected or by 85 per cent
of those voting in the ballot. Where legal protection is removed, any dismissal for
non-membership of a union is unfair. Terms in commercial contracts specifying
the use of union labour only were made unenforceable and discrimination on
the basis of union membership in the awarding of contracts was made unlawful.
Industrial action which seeks to persuade employers to discriminate in this way
or to interfere with the supply of goods or services on grounds of union
membership is unlawful. The Act also ended the position which gave trade
unions almost complete immunity from all civil actions by bringing their
position into line with that of their individual officials and members. This
means that trade unions now have immunity only for action taken in
furtherance or contemplation of a lawful trade dispute. There were also changes
to the definition of a trade dispute upon which immunity for civil actions
depends. Disputes between employer and employees (that is, most industrial
action) continue to qualify as lawful trade disputes, but disputes which have
become unlawful are those where there is no disagreement between an employer
and his or her employees, or those which have little to do with the normal
subject of a trade dispute (such as terms and conditions of work).
The Trade Union Act 1984 was introduced by the Government to ensure basic
standards of democracy in trade unions. It requires that all voting members of
the principal executive committee of a union should be elected by a secret and
direct ballot of the members at least once every five years, and requires unions to
compile and maintain a register of members’ names and addresses. It also
removes legal immunity from trade unions which call a strike or take other
industrial action without first holding a secret ballot of members concerned and
securing a majority vote for this action. In addition, the Act requires trade
unions with political funds to ballot their members at regular intervals to decide
whether the funds should be retained. Unless members had been balloted in
the previous ten years, trade unions with political funds were required to
hold a ballot in 1985—86 and all of the 38 unions involved voted to retain their
funds.
Northern Ireland has a broadly similar but separate system of industrial
relations legislation.
The Government has put forward for consideration a number of proposals which
are designed to strengthen the rights of individual trade union members,
reinforce their ability to exercise these rights and further improve the internal
democracy of unions. It proposes that an individual member should have the
right to restrain his or her trade union from authorising or endorsing industrial
action unless it has held a ballot. Protection against unfair disciplinary
measures is envisaged to protect union members who refuse to take industrial
action. The Government is also proposing to remove the remaining legal
protection for the closed shop. Measures put forward to increase democracy in
trade unions would involve the use of postal ballots under independent
supervision for elections for all members, whether voting or non-voting, of
principal executive committees and for ballots on political funds. To remedy
deficiencies in the arrangements for the enforcement of trade unions’ statutory
duties, various measures are proposed including the creation of a Commis¬
sioner for trade union affairs, with discretion to assist an individual in High
Court proceedings against his or her union.

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many employers in Britain are members of employers' organisations, some of
which are wholly concerned with labour matters although others are also
concerned with commercial matters or trade associations. The primary aims of
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of
employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety,
health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient
use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may
arise. Combined employers' organisations and trade associations may also
represent members' points of view as manufacturers or traders to the
Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis, for example, the Engineering Employers' Federation. A few
are purely local in character or deal with a section of an industry or, for example,
with small businesses; most are national and are concerned with the whole
of an industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional
organisations combined into national federations, while in others, within which
different firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a
complex structure with national and regional federations for parts of an
industry as well as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 335
employers’ associations known to the Certification Officer. Those which are
national organisations negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned; most of these national organisations
belong to the Confederation of British Industry.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is the largest central employers'
organisation in Britain, representing directly or indirectly some 250,000
businesses which together employ about half the working population. It aims
primarily to ensure that Government, national and international institutions
and the public understand the needs, intentions and problems of business.
Membership ranges from the smallest to the largest companies, private sector
and nationalised, and covers a broad spectrum which includes manufacturing,
agriculture, construction, distribution, mining, finance, retailing and insur¬
ance. Most national employers' organisations, trade associations and
some chambers of commerce are members. Policy is determined by a council
of 400 members, and there is a permanent staff of 350, while there are 13
regional offices and an office in Brussels. The CBI is the British member of the
Union of Industries of the European Community. The CBI nominates the
employers’ representatives on a number of bodies including the National
Economic Development Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the
Health and Safety Commission and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service.
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of employees
and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on freely
conducted negotiations at all levels.
Because of the publicity they receive, strikes are commonly thought to occur
much more frequently in Britain than in other countries. International
comparisons show, however, that Britain's record on industrial disputes is
better than those of a number of other major industrialised countries. In 1985
some 6-4 million working days were lost in Britain through industrial
stoppages, of which about two-thirds were accounted for by a major dispute in
the coal industry, while the number of recorded disputes was the lowest for
nearly 50 years. Although the number of disputes rose slightly in 1986, there

was a decline in the number of working days lost to 1 -9 million, the lowest since
1963.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for the
conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement between
employers or employers' associations and trade unions. Agreements may be
industry-wide, as is generally the case in the public sector, but are often
supplemented by local agreements in companies or factories (plant bargaining),
and bargaining and consultation are increasingly being conducted at plant level.
In some industries, companies and factories, negotiations are conducted by
meetings held when necessary, while in others, joint negotiating councils or
committees have been established on a permanent basis. The scope of the
various bodies (from national joint industrial councils for whole industries to
works councils and committees in individual workplaces) varies widely, and can
cover such additional matters as production plans, investment, training,
education, welfare and safety. Normally these arrangements for collective
bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but there is often
provision for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent
conciliation or arbitration. The Employment Protection Act 1975 as amended by
the Employment Act 1980 makes provision for information needed for collective
bargaining purposes to be disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is an independent
statutory body with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial
relations, and in particular of encouraging collective bargaining and the
development and (where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
ACAS is controlled by a council consisting of a full-time chairman and nine
part-time members experienced in industrial relations, of whom three are
nominated after consultation with the CBI, three after consultation with the
TUC, and three are independent. The Service conciliates in industrial disputes
in both the public and private sectors. ACAS assistance was sought in nearly
1,500 disputes in 1986. In addition, there were some 180 further requests
for ACAS to provide arbitration, which it may do either by appointing
single arbitrators or boards of arbitration or by referring cases to the
Central Arbitration Committee (see below). Although ACAS has prime respon¬
sibility for helping to resolve disputes, and has also set up major committees of
inquiry, the Secretary of State for Employment retains powers to appoint a
court of inquiry or committee of investigation into a dispute, but these are
rarely used.
The Service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and employment
policies to employers, managers, trade unions, employee representatives and
individuals, and it handled over 270,000 inquiries in 1986. Specialist staff
made over 9,000 advisory visits. ACAS also carries particular responsibility for
attempting conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee
rights (such as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the
Equal Pay Act 1970, including claims for equal pay for work of equal value, and
complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and
the Race Relations Act 1976). There were over 51,000 such cases in 1986. Its
Work Research Unit promotes, jointly through trade unions and employers, the
improvement of work structures and the quality of working life.
The Central Arbitration Committee is an independent standing arbitration
body. It provides boards of arbitration for the settlement of trade disputes
referred to it with the consent of the parties concerned and adjudicates on

claims made under the disclosure of information provisions of the Employment
Protection Act 1975.
The Office of Manpower Economics is an independent non-statutory organisa¬
tion responsible for servicing independent review bodies which advise on the
pay of various public-sector groups. These are the Top Salaries Review Body,
the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body, the Doctors’ and Dentists’ Review Body, and
the Review Body for Nurses and other National Health Service professions. The
Office also provides services for the Pharmacists’ Review Panel, the Police
Negotiating Board and the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. It is responsible
for research into pay and associated matters as requested by the Government.
Wages councils fix statutory minimum pay for over 2 million workers aged 21
and over, primarily in service industries such as retailing, catering and
hairdressing. There are 26 councils, each consisting of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and employees in the relevant industry and up to
five independent members. The Wages Act 1986, which replaced the Wages
Councils Act 1979, empowers each council to fix a single minimum hourly rate,
an overtime rate and a limit on deductions for accommodation provided.
Employers have a duty at civil and criminal law to take reasonable care of their
employees, and others affected by their work activities, and to provide a safe
system of working, while employees have a duty of care towards each other and
also to take care of their own safety. The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. Its purpose is to secure the health, safety and
welfare of people at work and to provide for the protection of the public whose
health and safety might be affected by work activities. The Act places general
duties on everyone concerned with work activities, including employers, the
self-employed, employees, manufacturers and suppliers.
The 1974 Act is superimposed on earlier health and safety legislation, such as
the Mines and Quarries Act 1954, the Factories Act 1961 and the Offices, Shops
and Railway Premises Act 1963 and the various regulations made under them.
The earlier legislation imposes specific obligations and standards on, for
example, occupiers of particular types of premises or employers engaged in
particular activities and covers such matters as the fencing of machinery,
precautions against the exposure of people to toxic dusts and gases, precautions
against fire, dangerous substances and special risks, the safe condition of
premises, and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
Some of the earlier legislation was replaced immediately by the 1974 Act, but
the remainder continues in force pending its progressive replacement by
regulations and codes of practice. Regulations made under the Act govern the
establishment of first-aid facilities, the control of work with lead and the control
of major accident hazards in industry, each set being supported by either an
approved code of practice or other guidance material. Others are in the course of
development, for example, on the control of hazardous substances.
A basic principle underlying the 1974 Act is that employers, in consultation
with their employees, should have the responsibility of working out health and
safety arrangements, within the broad obligations of the law, to suit their own
workplaces. Employers with five or more employees must draw up a written
policy for safety and health, and must inform their employees of the policy and of
the arrangements for its implementation. In workplaces where negotiations take
place with a trade union, the union may appoint safety representatives to be the
employees’ official channel for representation and consultation over safety
matters.

The Health and Safety Commission, established by the 1974 Act and account¬
able to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Employment, has
responsibility for developing policies, including guidance, codes of practice, or
proposals for regulations. In the case of proposals for changes in legislation, the
Commission consults the people who will be affected by them and makes
recommendations to the Secretary of State concerned. The Commission has an
independent chairman, three members appointed after consultation with the
CBI, three after consultation with the TUC, and two after consultation with local
authority associations. The Commission has seven subject advisory committees
(on toxic substances, on dangerous substances, on dangerous pathogens, on
genetic manipulation, on the safety of nuclear installations, on the safe
transport of radioactive materials and on medical matters), and 11 industry
advisory committees,*for agriculture, ceramics, construction, education, foun¬
dries, health services, oil, paper and board, printing, railways and rubber.
The 1974 Act also set up the Health and Safety Executive, which includes
government inspectorates covering a range of work activities: the Factory
Inspectorate (which also deals with a large number of activities outside factories
such as hospitals and educational establishments) and inspectorates for mines
and quarries, agriculture, nuclear installations and explosives. It also includes
the Medical Division, the Technology Division and the Research and Laboratory
Services Division. The inspectors, who have powers of entry and enforcement,
seek compliance with health and safety legislation in individual workplaces and
give advice. The Medical Division, through the Employment Medical Advisory
Service, provides a nationwide service of advice on the medical aspects of
employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, doctors and
others.
The Technology Division provides technical advice on industrial health and
safety matters. The Research and Laboratory Services Division provides
scientific and medical support and testing services, and carries out research
both in its own laboratories and through universities and other institutions on
a contract basis, often jointly funded by industry. Areas of study include
explosion risks, fires, protective equipment, methods for monitoring airborne
contaminants, occupational medicine and hygiene, and the safety of engineer¬
ing systems.
In some premises, mostly offices, shops, warehouses, restaurants and hotels,
health and safety legislation is enforced by inspectors appointed by local
authorities, working under guidance from the Health and Safety Commission.
Some other official bodies work under agency agreement with the Health and
Safety Commission, for example, the Railway Inspectorate (concerned with
worker safety on railways) and the Department of Energy (concerned with health
and safety in the oil industry).
In Northern Ireland, the Health and Safety Agency, roughly corresponding to the
Health and Safety Commission, and an Employment Medical Advisory Service
were set up by the Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978. The Northern
Ireland Department of Economic Development, through its Health and Safety
Inspectorate, is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety
legislation, which is broadly similar to that for Great Britain.
17 Public Finance
Public finance is concerned with taxation, expenditure and borrowing by central
and local government and the financing of public corporations. Central
government raises money from individuals and companies by direct and indirect
taxation and from National Insurance contributions. It spends money on goods
and services, such as health and defence, and in payments to people, such as
social security and pensions. Local government receives substantial grants from
central government and raises revenue mainly through rates (local property
taxes). From these resources it provides services such as education, police and
fire services, and refuse collection. The external finance of the nationalised
industries and other public corporations also has to be included in the
Government’s expenditure plans. The diagram (see p 357) shows the relative
importance of the various items of receipts (including borrowing) and expendi¬
ture for the public sector.
The government department responsible for broad control of public finance
and expenditure is the Treasury. The Bank of England (the central bank) advises
the Government on financial matters, executes monetary policy and acts as
banker to the Government.
PLANNING The background to the present Government’s planning of public finance is the
PUBLIC medium-term financial strategy, introduced in 1980. The Government’s aim is
FINANCE to maintain a firm financial framework in order to secure a fall in inflation and
ensure the continuation of the conditions for sustainable growth. With
commitments also to reduce taxation and curb the role of the State, the
Government has therefore sought to reduce public expenditure as a proportion
of national output as well. General government expenditure as a proportion of
gross domestic product fell from over 46 per cent in the early 1980s to a little
over 43 per cent in 1986—87. The 1987 public expenditure White Paper (see
below) implies a continued steady decline, to just above 41 per cent by 1989—90.
Table 40 shows the public expenditure planning totals and projections for the
public sector borrowing requirement to 1990-91.
The Planning Each year the Government conducts a review (the ‘public expenditure survey’) of
Cycle its expenditure plans for the forthcoming three years and publishes the
resulting totals, together with any changes in National Insurance, in the
Autumn Statement around November. Details of these plans and of the aims of
government expenditure and the output obtained are given in the annual public
expenditure White Paper which appears early in the following year, usually in
January.
The Government’s updating of the medium-term financial strategy and
consequent plans for the public finances over the following year, including any
tax changes, are set out in the Financial Statement and Budget Report,
published with the Budget around the end of the financial year (31 March).
Details are announced subsequently in the Finance Bill, which is presented to
Parliament shortly after the Budget and becomes law during the summer.

Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
The public expenditure planning total for 1987—88 has been set at £148,600
million. Of this, £108,300 million is allocated to central government, £40,200
million to local authorities and £1,700 million to nationalised industries and
other public corporations. The reserve (see below) accounts for £3,500 million.
Proceeds from privatisation, projected at £5,000 million, count as negative
public expenditure and are therefore deducted from the planning total.
Central government spending is largely voted by Parliament through the
annual Supply Estimates (see p 352). The rest consists mainly of those social
security payments which are made out of the National Insurance Fund. The
largest departmental programmes are those on social security payments (31 per
cent of the 1987-88 planning total), health and personal social services and
defence (each 13 per cent) and education and science (11 per cent). See Table 41.
About half of local authority spending is financed by grants from central
government. The rest is met from rates, surpluses on trading, rents and from
borrowing. Education accounts for around one-third of local authority spend¬
ing, with law and order, housing and other environmental services, personal
social services and transport accounting for most of the remainder.
The 1987-88 planning total included £1,700 million for spending by public
corporations, of which £700 million was attributable to nationalised industries’
external finance.
Of planned expenditure in 1987—88, cash payments to the personal sector—
for example, pensions and other social security benefits—comprise over
one-third; pay (other than that included in departmental running costs) and
purchases of assets, goods and services each about one-quarter; and departmen¬
tal running costs a little under one-tenth. The economic breakdown of each
department's spending varies. Capital spending in 1987—88 by central and local
government is planned to be £14,800 million and that by nationalised
industries and other public corporations £4,600 million.
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated reserve to cover all additions to
departmental spending during the year, whether arising from policy changes.

new initiatives or revisions to the estimated costs of demand-led programmes.
For 1987—88 the reserve is £3,500 million. The reserve has been set at higher
levels for each of the next two years but some will normally be allocated to
departments as spending plans are made firmer.

Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
Note: Expenditures on certain services (such as education) are made under the programmes for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland in addition to other departmental programmes.
Some 40 per cent of public expenditure is subject to control by cash limits
(external financing limits in the case of nationalised industries). Another 40 per
cent consists of demand-led services (for example, social security benefits) on
which, once policy and rates of payment have been determined, expenditure in
the short run depends on the number of eligible recipients. The remaining 20
per cent is current expenditure of local authorities, which central government
does not directly control; however, the major part of the contribution by central
government to such expenditure, the rate support grant, is subject to cash
limits.
Once fixed, cash limits are not usually revised during the course of the year
unless a decision is taken to alter the level of provision for the service concerned.
There is, however, a limited facility for carrying forward underspending on the

capital components of cash limits. If any overspending of cash limits occurs, a
corresponding deduction is normally made from the limits for the following year.
The annual public expenditure survey conducted by the Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each government department submits to the
Treasury in December, giving details of its cash requirements for the financial
year beginning in the following April. After approval by the Treasury, these
Supply Estimates are presented to Parliament in March, usually at the same
time as the Budget (see p 353). Parliament approves them in July as part of the
Annual Appropriation Act, expenditure between 1 April and this date being
covered by Votes on Account approved before the start of the financial year.
Supplementary Estimates may also be presented to Parliament during the
course of the year. If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the Public Accounts
Committee (see below) will investigate fully before Parliament is asked to approve
any Excess Vote to balance the account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for debates on the Supply Estimates,
following scrutiny by select committees of the House of Commons.
For 1987—88 the Supply Estimates provided for total expenditure of £104,500
million, of which three-quarters was to be direct spending by central govern¬
ment and the remainder would represent transfers to other parts of the
Government or the public sector. Some items of central government expendi¬
ture, for example, the salaries and pensions of judges, are paid directly out of the
Consolidated Fund (see p 353) as standing services and are not subject to
annual approval by Parliament.
Examination of public expenditure is carried out by select committees of the
House of Commons, which study in detail the activities of particular government
departments and require the attendance of ministers and officials for cross-
examination. The audit of the Government’s spending which follows up the
control inherent in parliamentary approval of the Estimates is exercised
through the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public
Accounts Committee.
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an officer of the House of Commons
appointed by the Crown, has two distinct functions. As Comptroller General, he
has the duty to ensure that all revenue and other public money payable to the
Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund (see p 353) is duly paid and
that all payments out of these funds are authorised by statute. As Auditor
General, his duties are to certify the accounts of all government departments
and those of a wide range of other public sector bodies; to examine revenue
accounts and inventories; and to report the results of his examinations to
Parliament. He also has wide statutory powers to carry out, and report to
Parliament on, examinations of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use
of resources by those bodies he audits or to which he has right of access.
The Public Accounts Committee considers the appropriation and other accounts
of government departments and the Comptroller and Auditor General’s reports
on them and on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of departments’ use of
their resources. The Committee takes evidence from the official heads of
departments and relevant public sector bodies and submits to Parliament
reports which carry considerable weight, and its recommendations are taken
very seriously by the departments and organisations that it examines. The
Government’s formal reply to the reports is presented to Parliament by the
Treasury in the form of Treasury minutes and the reports and minutes are
usually debated annually in the House of Commons.

THE BUDGET
TAX
REVENUE
The Government’s sterling expenditure is largely met out of the Consolidated
Fund, an account at the Bank of England into which tax receipts and other
revenues are paid. This is also known as the Exchequer. Any excess of
expenditure over receipts is met by the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National Insurance Fund, into which
contributions are paid by all employers and employed people, is used mainly to
pay for social security benefits; a small proportion of the Fund is used to help
finance the National Health Service.
The Budget—usually in March or April—sets out the Government’s proposals for
changes in taxation and is the main occasion for an annual review of economic
policy. The proposals are announced to the House of Commons by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget statement and are published in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report. This report also contains a review of
recent developments in the economy, together with an economic forecast—one
of the two which the Government is required to publish each year (the other
being contained in the Autumn Statement)—and sets out the fiscal and
.monetary framework within which economic policy operates. This is the
medium-term financial strategy (see p 349).
The Budget statement is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means (or
Budget) resolutions in which the proposals are embodied. When passed by the
House of Commons, these resolutions give temporary effect, under the
Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, to certain of the tax proposals; they are
the foundation of the Finance Bill, in which the proposals are set out for detailed
consideration by Parliament, becoming law as the Finance Act, usually in
the following July. The effect of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act is
thus to enable the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, at the
levels provided by the Budget proposals, pending enactment of the Finance
Bill.
The bulk of the tax proposals are concerned with changes in the rates or
coverage of taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the abolition of existing ones
and changes in the administrative machinery. These changes are made not only
with regard to the revenue required but also with regard to their effect on the
way the economy performs.
For two taxes—income tax and corporation tax—annual Ways and Means
resolutions followed by Finance Act clauses are required to maintain their
existence, since they are annual rather than permanent taxes. Thus, a Budget
and a Finance Act are necessary at or about the beginning of each financial year.
Tax changes can be made at other times of the year, however, either by specific
legislation or by the use of the regulator, which permits limited changes between
Budgets in value added tax (by up to 25 per cent) and the main excise duties (by
up to 10 per cent).
The three principal sources of tax revenue are: taxes on income, which include
income tax and corporation tax; taxes on capital, which include inheritance tax
and capital gains tax; and indirect taxes, which include customs and excise
duties, value added tax (VAT), rates (which are set and collected by local
authorities to help meet their expenditure), stamp duties and licence duties (for
example, on motor vehicles).
Table 42 shows the provisional revenue of central government from taxation
and other sources in 1986—87 and the forecasts for 1987—88.
Taxes on individual incomes are progressive in that larger incomes bear a
proportionately higher rate of tax. Thresholds and rate bands for income tax,
inheritance tax and capital gains tax are raised automatically each year in line

with the rise in retail prices over the previous calendar year unless the
Government proposes otherwise and Parliament approves. The Inland Revenue
assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties. HM
Customs and Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure (the
customs and excise duties and VAT).
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. For
1987—88 the basic rate of 27 per cent applies to the first £17,900 of taxable
income. A rate of 40 per cent applies to the £17,901—£20,400 band, 45 per cent
to the £20,401—£25,400 band, 50 per cent to the £25,401—£33,300 band and
55 per cent to the £33,301—£41,200 band, ending with a maximum rate of 60
per cent on taxable income over £41,200. These rates apply to both earned and
investment incomes.
A number of personal allowances and reliefs reduce the amount of a person’s
taxable income compared with gross income. The main allowances are £2,425
for the income of a single person or the earned income of a wife and £3,795 for
the income of a married man. Among the most important of the reliefs is that for
mortgage interest payments on borrowing for house purchase. Relief at the
basic rate is usually given ‘at source’ (that is, passed directly by the tax
authorities to the building society or bank making the loan rather than to the
individual taxpayer). Another relief is that under the business expansion
scheme, whereby certain investors in trading companies without a Stock
Exchange quotation (usually small companies) are able to obtain relief on up to
£40,000 invested in any one year.
Assuming only the basic personal allowances, a single person with an income
of £10,000 a year in 1987—88 pays £2,045 in income tax while a married man
with the same income pays £1,675. The amount of tax payable by a single
person varies from, for example, £695 on an annual income of £5,000 to
£32,203 on one of £70,000.
The income of married couples is usually taxed as if it all belonged to the
husband. A couple may, however, choose to have the wife’s earnings charged
separately for tax on condition that the husband receives the single instead of
the married personal allowance. Any joint investment income, however, is taxed
as part of the husband’s income.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in Britain
(although some forms of income—such as certain social security benefits—are
exempt) and on all income arising abroad of people resident in Britain. Interest
on certain British government securities belonging to people not ordinarily
resident in Britain is exempt. Britain has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is often allowed. British residents working abroad
for the whole year benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Company taxation in Britain is at a significantly lower rate than in most other
industrialised countries. Companies pay corporation tax on their profits
remaining after deduction of certain allowances. A company which distributes
profits to its shareholders is required to make to the Inland Revenue an advance
payment of corporation tax. In general, this payment is set against a company’s
liability to corporation tax on its income and the recipient of the distribution is
entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies his or her liability to income tax at. the
basic rate.

annual writing-down allowance for industrial buildings and a 25 per cent

Petroleum revenue tax (deductible in computing profits for corporation tax) is
charged on profits from the production, as opposed to the refining or other
forms of processing, of oil and gas under licence in Britain and on its
Continental Shelf. The rate of tax is 75 per cent. Each licensee of an oilfield is
charged on the profits from that field after deduction of certain allowances and
reliefs which, among other things, encourage exploration, appraisal and future
field development. The tax is computed at half-yearly intervals and the bulk of it
is collected in monthly instalments.
Inheritance tax applies to transfers of personal wealth made up to seven years
before the donor’s death and to transfers relating to property held in most types
of trust. It is chargeable on a cumulative basis over a seven-year period. The
rates of tax are progressively higher on successive slices of the cumulative total
of chargeable transfers, with the transfer on death treated as the final transfer.
The first £90,000 is exempt; the rates on higher amounts rise from 30 per cent
on the slice between £90,000 and £140,000 to 60 per cent on the excess over
£330,000. There is, however, tapered relief for transfers made between three
and seven years before the donor’s death, which reduces the tax charge but not
the cumulative effect. This ranges from relief of 20 per cent for transfers made
between three and four years of death to relief of 80 per cent for those made
between six and seven years of death.
Capital gains realised on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax or,
in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is 30 per cent but
individuals are exempt from tax in respect of total net gains of up to £6,600 in
any one year and most trusts on gains of up to £3,300. The effects of inflation
since April 1982 are allowed for when measuring gains. The tax on gifts and
certain deemed disposals of assets may be deferred until the assets are sold.
Certain assets, including the principal private residence, chattels worth less
than £3,000 (and any chattels with a predictable life of less than 50 years except
those on which the expenditure qualifies for a capital allowance), private motor
cars, and National Savings Certificates and Bonds are normally exempt. Gains
on government securities and corporate bonds are exempt from the tax, as are
gains on shares owned under the Personal Equity Plan (designed to encourage
wider share ownership) provided they have been held for at least one calendar
year.
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly based tax, chargeable at 15 per cent. It is
collected at each stage in the production and distribution of goods and services
by taxable persons (generally those whose business has a turnover of more than
£21,300 a year). The final tax is borne by the consumer. When a taxable person
purchases taxable goods or services, the supplier charges VAT (the taxable
person’s input tax). When the taxable person supplies taxable goods or services
to customers, then they in turn are charged VAT (the taxable person’s output
tax). The difference between the output tax and the input tax is paid to, or
repaid by, Customs and Excise.
There are two methods by which certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT: one is by charging VAT at a zero rate (a taxable person does not charge tax
to a customer but reclaims any input tax paid to suppliers); the other is by
exemption (a taxable person does not charge a customer any output tax and is
not entitled to deduct or reclaim the input tax). Zero-rating applies to exports
and to most food; books, newspapers and periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and

Exemption applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal services, betting,
gaming (other than by gaming machines and lotteries), finance, education,
health, burial and cremation, and supplies by trade unions and professional
bodies to their members.
Oils used for road fuel bear duty at the basic rate although there are duty
differentials in favour of derv and unleaded petrol. Heavy oil not used for road
fuel and light oil used for furnace fuel bear a lower duty and, except for
lubricating oil, are zero-rated for VAT. Oil used as chemical feedstocks, or
otherwise than as fuel, and most lubricating oils are relieved from duty. There
are duties on spirits, beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry, mainly related to
alcoholic strength. The cigarette duty is based partly on a charge per 1,000
cigarettes and partly on a percentage of retail price. Duty on other tobacco
products is based on the weight of the finished product. The principal betting
duties are the general betting duty, which is charged at a rate of 8 per cent of the
stake money, for off-course bets only; pool betting duty (which applies to football
pools), charged at a rate of 42-5 per cent of the stake money (33-3 per cent for
charity pools); and bingo duty, charged at 10 per cent. Revenue is also raised
from licences on the operation of gaming machines and casinos.
The licence duty on a private motor car or light van is £100 a year; for motor
cycles it is £10, £20 or £40 a year according to engine capacity. The licence duty
on goods vehicles is charged on the basis of gross weight and, if over 12 tonnes,
according to the number of axles; the duty is designed to ensure that such
vehicles cover at least their road costs through the tax paid (licence duty and fuel
duty). Taxis and buses are taxed according to seating capacity.
New cars, motor cycles, scooters, mopeds and some motor caravans, whether
British made or imported, are chargeable with car tax at 10 per cent on the
wholesale value. VAT is charged on the price including car tax.
Transfers or sales of property (other than of stocks and shares) above a value of
£30,000 are subject to stamp duty of 1 per cent on the whole of the purchase
price. Transfers or sales of stocks and shares are subject to stamp duty of 0-5 per
cent regardless of the amount. Transfers by gift are subject to a fixed 50p duty.
Transfers to charities are exempt.
Customs duties are chargeable in accordance with the Common Customs Tariff
of the European Community (no such duties are chargeable on goods which
qualify as Community goods). Special customs import and export procedures
are operated under the Common Agricultural Policy and Community levies are
chargeable on a wide range of agricultural products from non-Community
countries. Customs duties and agricultural levies are accountable to the
European Community as ‘own resources’.
The maintenance of a low public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in
relation to gross domestic product (GDP) is an important part of the Govern¬
ment’s medium-term financial strategy. In 1986—87 the PSBR amounted to 1
per cent of GDP; it is projected to remain at this level up to 1990—91 (see Table
40). As part of the policy of controlling the rate of growth of the money stock, the
Government seeks to finance the PSBR by sales of public sector debt outside the
banking system. The outturn for the PSBR in 1986—87 was £3,300 million

Debt
compared with a forecast of £7,000 million at the time of the 1986 Budget.
Gross sales of government stock (known as gilt-edged stock as there is no risk of
default) to the non-bank private and overseas sectors amounted to £4,300
million in 1986—87 and sales of National Savings instruments £3,400 million.
Gilt-edged stock is marketable and is traded on the Stock Exchange. Individuals
may also make transactions through post offices in stocks included on the
Department for National Savings' Stock Register. Pension funds and life
insurance companies have the largest holdings. The Government issues both
conventional and indexed stock (on which principal and interest are linked to
the movement in the retail prices index).
The main range of National Savings products is non-marketable and is
designed to attract personal savings. They are an important additional source of
government funding and are aimed at personal savers who are not attracted to
gilt-edged stock. The chief products are National Savings Certificates, Income
Bonds, Deposit Bonds and National Savings Bank Investment Accounts. In
1986—87 the main contributors to funding were Income Bonds (£1,813 million
net), fixed-interest Savings Certificates (£868 million net) and the Investment
Account (£796 million), and the contribution made by net accrued interest from
National Savings as a whole (that is, interest added less that paid out) amounted
to £1,314 million in 1986—87.
The other principal debt instruments of central government are Treasury bills
and certificates of tax deposit. Treasury bills are 91-day bills sold at a weekly
auction; certificates of tax deposit may be purchased by individuals or corporate
bodies to be tendered in settlement of a range of taxes and are non-marketable.
The bulk of public corporations’ borrowing is met by central government
through the National Loans Fund although their temporary borrowing needs are
met largely from the market, usually under Treasury guarantee. That part of
local authority borrowing met by central government is supplied by authorisa¬
tion of Parliament through the Public Works Loan Board from the National
Loans Fund. (The Board remains an independent body even though it is merged
for administrative purposes with the former National Debt Office, forming the
National Investment and Loans Office.) The local authorities also borrow directly
from the market, both short-term and long-term, through a range of instru¬
ments. Some public corporations and local authorities also borrow on occasion,
under special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
Net central government borrowing each year represents an addition to the
National Debt. At the end of March 1987 the National Debt amounted to some
£186,000 million of which about £6,000 million was in currencies other than
sterling. Of the £180,000 million sterling debt, £137,000 million consisted of
gilt-edged stock; of this, 30 per cent had a maturity of up to five years, 41 per
cent a maturity of over five years and up to 15 years and 29 per cent a maturity of
over 15 years or undated. The remaining sterling debt was made up mainly
of national savings (£27,000 million), certificates of tax deposits, Treasury
bills, and Ways and Means advances (very short-term internal government
borrowing).
18 Banking
and Financial
Institutions
Britain is a major financial centre providing a wide range of specialised services.
Historically the centre of the industry was located in the famous ‘Square Mile’ in
the City of London. This remains broadly the case today, even though the
markets for financial and related services have grown and diversified greatly.
The City of London has the greatest concentration of banks in the world
(responsible for about a quarter of total international bank lending), the world’s
biggest insurance market (with about one-fifth of the international market) and
a Stock Exchange with a larger listing of securities than any other exchange,
and remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities. It also exploits its position between the time zones of
the United States and the Far East.
Banking, finance and insurance accounted for 5-6 per cent of Britain’s total
output in 1980, a share which is believed to have risen subsequently. They
accounted for 3-4 per cent of employment in 1986. The net identified overseas
earnings of British financial institutions in 1986 were £9,375 million.
The increase in the rate of international movements of capital in the 1960s and
1970s took the form mainly of increased bank lending and foreign exchange
trading. London became the international centre of this activity, particularly in
the eurocurrency markets (see p 372), and the number of overseas banks
represented in London is larger than in any other financial centre. In the 1980s,
with increasing international competition in financial services and with
developments in technology, there has also taken place a rapid growth in the
international markets for securities. London again has played an important
role, especially in the market for eurobonds, in a variety of currencies (see
p 372). The London Stock Exchange (see p 370) is reorganising itself, partly in
order to adapt to this situation, and has changed its membership rules with the
result that numerous financial institutions in London, both British and
foreign-based, have formed new alliances with each other.
Supervision To help Britain’s financial services industry to respond to the new competitive
climate, while at the same time maintaining adequate safeguards for the
investing public, the Government has enacted three pieces of legislation
affecting the supervision of the industry: the Financial Services Act 1986, the
Building Societies Act 1986 (see p 366) and the Banking Act 1987 (see p 363).
Under the Financial Services Act a new supervisory framework is being built up
which is expected to be fully in force in early 1988. Investment businesses (those
effecting transactions in, managing or giving advice on investments taking the
form of securities of all kinds, financial and commodity futures, life assurance,
options contracts and certain other instruments—but not wholesale money-

market instruments) will require authorisation and will have to obey rules of
conduct based on principles set out in the legislation. The Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry will be empowered to authorise and regulate the carrying on
of investment business. However, the majority of these powers have been
transferred to a designated agency—the Securities and Investments Board
(SIB)—on the condition that it continues to meet specified criteria. The SIB, in
turn, is empowered to recognise self-regulating organisations (SROs) provided
that they offer investors protection at least equivalent to that provided by the
SIB. Both the SIB and the SROs will be practitioner-based bodies. It is intended
that most investment businesses should become authorised by obtaining
membership of an SRO.
In enacting each of the three pieces of legislation referred to above, the
Government has made provision for improved co-operation between supervisors
in different financial sectors, while seeking to avoid any harm thereby to
efficiency, competitiveness and flexibility within the sectors themselves. The
Bank of England, the Building Societies Commission, the Treasury and the
Department of Trade and Industry have prime responsibility for supervision in
different parts of the financial sector. The Government has also reinforced the
powers of investigators in cases of fraud and insider dealing and strengthened
the measures for treating offenders, is setting up a new government
department—the Serious Fraud Office—to investigate and prosecute cases of
serious and complex fraud, and is helping to extend international co-operation
on the handling of such cases. Memoranda of understanding about the
regulation of dealings in securities were reached with the United States in 1986
and with Japan in 1987, and further agreements on mutual assistance are
actively being sought.
Changes within the financial services sector as a whole are expected to erode
traditional distinctions between financial institutions, with single firms provid¬
ing a broader range of services, both in domestic and international markets.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. The Bank’s main functions
are to execute monetary policy, to act as banker to the Government, to act as a
note-issuing authority and to exercise prudential supervision over and provide
central banking facilities for the banking system. It also manages the Exchange
Equalisation Account and maintains the register of holdings of government
securities on behalf of the Treasury. More generally the Bank has a responsi¬
bility for overseeing the soundness of the financial system as a whole.
The Government’s Medium-Term Strategy provides the framework for its
economic policy. Monetary and fiscal policies are designed to keep a steady
downward pressure on the growth of money GDP (the average measure of gross
domestic product at current prices) over the medium term, so bringing down
inflation. The essential instrument of the Government’s monetary policy is
short-term interest rates. These are influenced by the Bank’s operations in the
financial markets (see p 370) on behalf of the Government.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England is responsible for
arranging government borrowing and for managing the National Debt.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
banknotes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern Ireland
banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from a small
amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by holdings
of Bank of England notes. Responsibility for the provision of coin circulation lies
with the Royal Mint, a government trading fund.
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
363
DEPOSIT¬
TAKING
INSTITUTIONS
The Bank is able to influence money market conditions through its dealings
with the discount houses (see p 366), which developed in the nineteenth
century as bill brokers for industrialists. The discount houses hold mainly
Treasury, local authority and commercial bills and negotiable certificates of
deposit financed by short-term loans from the banks. If on any given day there is
a shortage of cash in the banking system as a result, for example, of large tax
payments or heavy sales of government securities, the Bank relieves the
shortage either by buying bills from the discount houses or by lending directly to
them. This permits the banks to replenish their cash balances at the Bank by
recalling some of their short-term loans to the discount houses. The Bank
conducts its operations in such a way as to keep short-term interest rates within
an unpublished band.
Under the Financial Services Act 1986 (see p 361) the Bank is responsible for
the supervision of the main wholesale markets in London for money, foreign
exchange and gold bullion. (The markets are wholesale in the sense that the
participants are professional operators dealing in large amounts of money.)
Under the Banking Act 1987 deposit-taking organisations require authorisa¬
tion from the Bank of England (unless they are specifically exempted) and are
subject to the Bank of England’s supervision. The Act—whose broad aims are to
improve and update supervisory arrangements—created a Board of Banking
Supervision to advise the Governor and senior staff of the Bank and increased
the Bank’s powers to modify the conduct of banking institutions, to investigate
cases of illegal deposit-taking, to block bank mergers and takeovers on
prudential grounds and to require information to be supplied to it by banks. The
Act also enables information to be shared, in strictly controlled ways, among
supervisors in different financial services, and permits auditors to make reports
to the Bank of England about a bank if the circumstances justify it.
On behalf of the Treasury, the Bank manages the Exchange Equalisation
Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign exchange,
SDRs (which are claims on the International Monetary Fund) and European
Currency Units (ECUs). Using the resources of the EEA, the Bank may intervene
in the foreign exchange markets to check undue fluctuations in the exchange
value of sterling.
Deposit-taking institutions may be broadly divided into the ‘monetary sector’,
which includes the banks and is supervised by the Bank of England, and those
institutions outside the monetary sector, of which the most important are the
building societies and the National Savings Bank. The monetary sector includes
certain banks in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
Another useful distinction is that between ‘retail’ banking and ‘wholesale’
banking. Retail banking is mainly concerned with the cash withdrawal services
and transmission of deposited funds—the main reason why people keep bank
accounts. Competition between the banks and the building societies in the
provision of money transmission services has increased during the last two
decades and is expected to increase further. Wholesale business involves the
taking of large deposits at higher rates of interest, the deployment of funds in
money market instruments (see p371) and the making of large loans and
investments. Nearly all the commercial banks in Britain engage in some
wholesale activities and some, like the merchant and overseas banks, centre
their business on them. Many of such wholesale dealings are conducted on the
inter-bank market, that is, among the banks themselves.
At the beginning of 1987 there were 641 institutions in the monetary sector,
comprising 19 retail banks (including the Banking Department of the Bank of
England), 35 accepting houses (merchant banks), 206 other British banks, 351
foreign banks, 22 consortium banks and 8 discount houses.

The major retail banks are those with a significant branch network, which offer
a full range of financial services to both individuals and companies, including
the provision of current and deposit accounts and various kinds of loan
arrangements, together with a full range of money transmission facilities.
The dominant banks in England and Wales are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland,
National Westminster and the TSB Group, which was formed out of the former
Trustee Savings Banks and achieved a successful share flotation in 1986. The
major Scottish banks are Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale (a part of the Midland
Bank Group) and Royal Bank of Scotland. Other important retail banks are
Co-operative Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Girobank, which is a subsidiary of the
Post Office, operating through its local branches. Northern Ireland is served by
branch networks of four banks, two being subsidiaries of British banks and two
subsidiaries of Irish banks.
With the growth of the financial services sector since the 1970s, and with a
relaxation of restrictions on competition among financial institutions, the
major banks have increasingly diversified the services they provide. They have
lent more money for house purchases, and have established or acquired
substantial interests in finance houses, leasing and factoring companies,
merchant banks, securities dealers, insurance companies and unit trust
companies.
The banks provide loan facilities to industrial companies and, since the
1970s, have provided more medium- and long-term loans than they did
formerly. They have also become important providers of finance for small firms:
they have supported a loan guarantee scheme under which 70 per cent of the
value of loans to small companies is guaranteed by the Government, and some
banks have set up special subsidiaries to provide equity finance for small
companies (see p 370).
The clearing banks also conduct extensive international operations which
account for a substantial proportion of their business. In addition to maintain¬
ing overseas subsidiaries they are very active in the eurocurrency markets (see
p 372).
The total liabilities/assets of the retail banks amounted to £218,000 million at
the end of 1986, of which 60 per cent was sterling deposits, 23 per cent other
currency deposits and the remainder was items in suspense or transmission
and capital and other funds. Of the £131,000 million sterling deposits, about a
half was sight deposits (which can be withdrawn on demand) and half time
deposits. The banks' main liquid assets consist of balances at the Bank of
England, money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), their holdings of
Treasury and some other bills, and short-dated British government securities.
They also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio investments (mainly
longer-dated British government securities) or trade investments.
Total sterling deposits of the Committee of London and Scottish Clearing
Banks were reported to be £156,800 million at the end of 1986, the largest
proportions being held by National Westminster (27 per cent), Barclays (22 per
cent), Midland (16 per cent), and Lloyds (16 per cent).
The main retail banks operate through some 11,800 branches and sub¬
branches. National Westminster has the largest number (3,133), followed by
Barclays (2,842), Lloyds (2,152), Midland (2,100) and the TSB (1,576). Nearly
two-thirds of all adults in Britain have a current account and over one-third a
deposit account.
The London-based inter-bank clearing systems are administered by three
separate companies operating under an umbrella organisation, the Association
for Payment Clearing Services. The three clearing companies cover bulk paper

clearings (cheques and credit transfers); high-value clearings for same-day
settlement (automated payments and ‘town clearing’); and bulk electronic
clearings (through Bankers Automated Clearing Services, comprising standing
orders and direct debits). Membership of each of these clearing companies is
open to any bank or financial institution that meets certain published criteria,
which include meeting a minimum volume of transactions in that clearing, and
having settlement account facilities at the Bank of England. Two large building
societies joined the bulk electronic clearings in mid-1987 and one of them was
accepted for membership of bulk paper clearings.
In addition to the money transmission services handled by the three clearing
companies, nearly all the major banks (and increasingly building societies) have
substantial networks of automated teller machines or cash dispensers. In 1987
there were over 10,000 of them in Britain. These give customers access to cash
and other services up to 24 hours a day. Trials of a number of electronic home
banking services are being conducted by banks and building societies.
All the major retail banks offer their customers cheque guarantee cards which
entitle holders to reciprocal encashment facilities up to £50 a day. The same
card will also guarantee transactions with retailers up to the same amount.
Plans are advanced for a single nationwide ‘EFTPOS’ system (electronic funds
transfer at point of sale) which will enable shoppers to pay for goods by using a
plastic card which would transfer funds directly from their bank accounts via
terminals installed in retail premises. The inaugural scheme involving 2,000
terminals in Leeds, Southampton and Edinburgh is planned for the end of
1988. Meanwhile a number of banks and building societies are carrying out
limited EFTPOS trials around the country.
Credit cards associated with major retail banks are also a popular means of
payment. Access operates within the Mastercard world system and Barclaycard
within VISA.
Uniform eurocheques supported by a uniform eurocheque card are now
available from all major banks. These standard-format, high-security cheques
may be used to obtain cash or make payments in Britain or overseas. The
cheques are made out in the currency of the country in which they are being
used, with a guarantee limit of approximately £100 per cheque, but without
limit on the number of cheques that may be drawn in respect of a single
transaction.
Merchant banks have traditionally been primarily concerned with the accepting
(or guaranteeing) of commercial bills and with the sponsoring of capital issues
on behalf of their customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex
range of activities with important roles in international finance and the
short-term capital markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services
to British industrial companies, especially where mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of
investment holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds. A number of
merchant banks have become part of financial conglomerates offering an even
wider range of financial services than hitherto. The principal merchant banks
are the 16 members of the Accepting Houses Committee, together with the
merchant banking arms of Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster. The
British branches of some overseas banks also engage in merchant banking.
Some 520 overseas banks and financial institutions were represented in Britain
in 1987 through branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and consortia. A
total of 489 were directly represented while 29 were represented only through a
stake in a consortium. Of those directly represented, 75 were from the United
States, 44 from Japan and 196 from Europe. They provide a comprehensive

banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade
not only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
Citibank of the United States is expanding its activities in the retail banking
market in Britain and has joined the high-value clearing system (see p 365).
A number of banking institutions have their head offices in Britain but operate
mainly abroad, often specialising in particular regions such as Latin America or
East Asia through extensive branch networks. The major bank in this sector is
Standard Chartered.
The discount houses are an institution unique to the City of London. They act as
intermediaries between the Bank of England and the rest of the banking sector,
promote an orderly flow of short-term funds between the Government and the
banks, and lend to the Government by guaranteeing to subscribe for the whole
of the weekly offer of Treasury bills (which are three-month instruments). In
return for acting as intermediaries, the discount houses have privileged daily
access to the Bank of England as ‘lender of last resort’. Assets of the discount
houses consist mainly of Treasury and commercial bills, government and local
authority securities and negotiable certificates of deposit denominated in both
sterling and United States dollars.
Building societies are mutual institutions which raise short-term deposits from
individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw their money on demand or
at short notice, and provide long-term loans at variable rates of interest against
the security of property—usually private dwellings purchased for owner-
occupation.
Building societies have grown very rapidly since 1918, reflecting a continued
high growth of owner-occupation. They account for most lending for house
purchase in Britain and are the principal repository for the personal sector’s
liquid assets (although banks’ shares have increased in both areas since 1985).
About 64 per cent of all adults have building society accounts. The societies have
expanded the range of services to investors, a variety of saving schemes have
been established, and a growing number of societies provide cheque facilities
and automated cash withdrawal systems.
Competition among the building societies and between building societies and
other financial institutions has increased in the 1980s and the earlier system of
agreed rates of interest for loans by and deposits with the societies has been
abandoned.
The three largest societies (the Halifax, Abbey National and Nationwide)
account for 45 per cent of the total assets of the movement and the 20 largest for
some 90 per cent. Mergers between building societies are a continuing trend,
and in mid-1987 the Nationwide and Anglia societies agreed to merge. At the
end of 1986 there were 151 registered building societies with assets totalling
£140,603 million; about £36,000 million was advanced in new mortgages in the
course of the year.
The Government enacted legislation in 1986 to allow the societies to diversify
their financial and housing services. As a result up to 10 per cent of a society’s
commercial assets may be used for purposes other than loans on first mortgage
of owner-occupied houses, with up to 5 per cent placed in new types of asset
such as unsecured loans, housing, and investments in subsidiaries and
associates. Societies may also offer a wider range of banking and money
transmission services (including reciprocal encashment and paying arrange¬
ments with other financial institutions) as well as estate agency, insurance
broking, share dealing facilities, personal pensions and other services. Changes
to the arrangements for the prudential supervision of building societies include

the establishment of a new supervisory commission, and provisions allowing a

The National Savings Bank is run by the Department of National Savings based
in Glasgow and provides a system for depositing and withdrawing savings at
20,000 post offices around the country or by post. There are about 19 million
accounts. In 1987 Ordinary Accounts earned interest at 3 or 6 per cent a year
(depending on the balance maintained); the first £70 of annual interest is tax
free. Investment Accounts earn a higher variable rate of interest, which is
taxable. At the end of March 1987 the sum of the two accounts totalled £8,000
million. All interest is paid without deduction of tax at source. The National
Savings Bank does not offer lending facilities. As with other National Savings
instruments, its deposits are employed to finance the Government’s public
sector borrowing requirement. The other instruments include tax-free savings
certificates, which either pay fixed rates of interest or a (lower) fixed rate of
interest combined with index-linking; and taxable Income Bonds, Indexed-
Income Bonds and Deposit Bonds, where interest is paid without deduction of
tax at source. At the end of March 1987 the total amount of money invested in
National Savings was £34,000 million.
The investing institutions are those which collect savings and invest them in the
securities market and other long-term assets. The main investing institutions
are the insurance companies, the pension funds, the unit trusts and investment
trusts.
The British insurance industry provides a comprehensive and competitive
service domestically and internationally. It has been estimated that it handles
some 20 per cent of general insurance business placed on the international
market. The London market is the world’s leading centre for insurance where, in
addition to the British companies and Lloyd’s, a large number of overseas
companies are represented. It is the world centre for the placement of
international reinsurance and, partly as a consequence, many British com¬
panies have formed close relationships with overseas companies. Some British
companies confine their activities to domestic business but most large
companies undertaking general business transact a substantial amount
overseas through branches, agencies or affiliated local companies. Over a half of
the non-life premium income of British insurance companies and Lloyd’s is
derived from overseas. Insurance companies carrying on business in Britain are
supervised by the Department of Trade and Industry under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982. About 830 companies, of which some 170 are from
overseas, are authorised to carry on one or more classes of insurance business in
Britain. The total net assets of these companies were £151,487 million at the
end of 1985.
Around 420 companies belong to the Association of British Insurers and these
account for about 92 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Long-term insurance is handled by some 280 authorised insurance com¬
panies and is also available through certain friendly societies. Some 90 per cent
of this business is transacted through the members of the Association of British
Insurers. Lloyd's underwriters also write short-term life business.
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the seventeenth century, is an
incorporated society of private insurers in London. Although its activities were
originally confined to the conduct of marine insurance, a very considerable
world-wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business

(such as non-marine, aviation and motor) has been built up. Long-term life and
financial guarantee business is not covered.
Lloyd's is not a company but a market for insurance administered by the
Council of Lloyd's, where business is carried out for individual underwriting
members for their own account and risk and in competition with each other and
with insurance companies. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd's
brokers who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriting agents on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, for whom insurance is
transacted with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Council, are permitted to accept
insurance risks at Lloyd's; these and other safeguards give security to a Lloyd’s
policy.
In January 1987 there were some 31,500 underwriting members of Lloyd’s
grouped into about 365 syndicates managed at Lloyd's by underwriting agents
who are responsible for accepting risks and for settling claims on behalf of the
members of their syndicates.
Lloyd's is self-regulating under private Acts of Parliament dating from 1871 to
1982. The Lloyd’s Act 1982, which established the Council of Lloyd's (an elected
legislative body with wide-ranging disciplinary powers), inaugurated a period of
intensive reform of the society, resulting in the introduction of new measures to
protect the interests of Lloyd’s members. Following the report of a government-
appointed committee of inquiry, further measures were introduced by the
Council in 1987 to ensure that Lloyd’s members—particularly those not active in
the market as agents—should enjoy a level of protection comparable with that
proposed for the general investor under the Financial Services Act 1986 (see
p 361).
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the insured, are an essential part of the
Lloyd's market and a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers
specialise in reinsurance business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of
contracts between companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as
London representatives of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act
1977 provides for the registration and regulation of insurance brokers by the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council. In August 1987 nearly 15,000 indi¬
viduals were registered with the Council, through 1,700 partnerships or
traderships and 3,300 limited companies.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and reinsurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the governments
of member states and intended to harmonise the legislation of the various
member countries. Directives cover reinsurance, compulsory motor insurance,
freedom of establishment for life and non-life insurers. Community co-
insurance and insurance intermediaries. Britain strongly supports the removal
of national regulations and exchange controls that restrict the creation of a full
common market in services, particularly financial services.
Virtually all occupational pension schemes are based on trust funds managed so
as to protect the interests of the members. Pension contributions are invested
either directly in the securities and other investment markets or through
intermediaries such as insurance companies. The market value of assets held by
pension funds rose from £2,000 million in 1957 to about £190,000 million in
1986 when 15 per cent was in British government securities and 69 per cent in
company securities. The pension funds have grown strongly since 1960 to
become a dominant force in securities markets. Under government proposals to
encourage the expansion of occupational schemes and personal pensions, both

types of provision for retirement will be subject to investor protection legislation
(see p 361).
Investment and unit trusts enable investors in securities to spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management. Investment trusts are companies
which observe certain requirements of the Stock Exchange and the tax
authorities and invest in securities for the benefit of their shareholders. The
total value of all unit trust investments in 1986 was £32,131 million.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company and
a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell units to
the public and also repurchase them on demand. The sums held must be
invested in securities. The costs of running the trust are met partly by an initial
charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a periodic service
charge which is usually taken out of the trust’s income. Authorisation by the
Department of Trade and Industry is needed before units can be offered to the
public; this is granted only if the trust deed meets the Department’s require¬
ments. Trusts are allowed to hold up to 25 per cent of their assets in shares
traded on the Unlisted Securities Market (see p 371) and certain other secondary
markets; within this total up to 5 per cent may be held in the form of other
unlisted securities. Under the new legislation for the financial services industry
(see p 361), authorised unit trusts will be able to invest in a wider range of assets
in order to allow a greater variety of investment opportunities to be offered to the
public. In April 1987 there were 3-8 million unit trust holdings with a total value
of some £39,000 million.
The specialised institutions are agencies created to meet the needs of specific
groups of borrowers—mostly industrial and commercial—which were not
adequately covered by other institutions. They are to be found in both the public
and the private sectors. Some of the latter were set up with official support but
with financing from banks and other financial institutions. They may offer loan
finance or equity capital.
The main private sector institutions are described below. Among public sector
agencies are the British Technology Group, the Scottish and Welsh Development
Agencies, the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland, the Co¬
operative Development Agency and the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Finance houses are major suppliers of hire-purchase finance for the personal
sector and of short-term credit and leasing (see below) to the corporate sector.
Some 80 per cent of all their business is accounted for by the 48 firms which
constitute the Finance Houses Association (FHA). At the end of 1986 credit
outstanding to the members of the FHA was over £24,600 million. Many of the
finance houses are owned by banks, and most of them are licensed deposit¬
taking institutions.
Leasing companies buy and own plant or equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental. This form of finance grew quickly in
importance in the 1970s, partly because the leasing companies were able to take
advantage of investment incentives to the benefit of customers whose tax
position would otherwise have made them unavailable. The restructuring of
corporate tax rates and capital allowances in the 1984 Budget, however, is
expected to reduce the advantages of some forms of leasing in the long run,
although it led to a rise in leasing business during a transitional period which
ended in March 1986. In 1986 the 72 members of the Equipment Leasing
Association acquired assets in Britain valued at some £5,200 million, which
represented about 17 per cent of all investment in plant and machinery.

Factoring consists of making cash available to a company in exchange for the
sums owing to it. Since the early 1960s factoring has developed as a major
financial service, covering international activities as well as domestic trade. In
1986 member companies of the Association of British Factors handled business
of £5,688 million (representing over 90 per cent of all factoring business in
Britain) and 4,826 companies made use of the Association’s services.
Finance corporations meet the need for medium- and long-term capital when
such funds are not easily or directly available from traditional sources such as
the Stock Exchange or the banks. When the capital takes the form of equity
finance for innovative or other ‘high-risk’ companies, it is often known as
venture capital.
Investors in Industry (known as 3i) supports investment programmes over the
whole range of industry. During the year ended 31 March 1987 the corporation
invested £368 million. Within the last few years it has become increasingly
prominent in financing management buy-outs’, which involve the purchase of
businesses by their management and other staff from their owners. The shares
in Investors in Industry are owned by the Bank of England (15 per cent) and the
individual London and Scottish clearing banks.
There are well over 100 venture and development capital companies which
take equity stakes in small and medium-sized firms. Many of these companies
are subsidiaries of other financial institutions, including banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. The 77 full members of the British Venture
Capital Association invested a total of £384 million in British companies in
1986, an increase of 38 per cent on the previous year.
The main organised domestic financial markets are the securities markets, of
which the Stock Exchange is the most important, and the money markets.
Other important markets in the City of London are the foreign exchange market,
the financial futures market, the eurobond and eurocurrency markets, the
Lloyd’s insurance market (see p 367) and the gold bullion and commodity
markets.
The Stock Exchange has its main administrative centre in London. There are
also centres in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham and Dublin.
The Exchange has been changing radically in recent years. Its rules on
membership were altered to allow corporate ownership of member firms; the
system under which dealers charged fixed minimum scales of commission to the
investing public were abolished in favour of negotiated commissions; dealers
were permitted to trade in securities both on their own behalf, as principals, and
on behalf of clients, as agents, these two roles having been kept distinct
formerly; and a screen-based dealing system came into operation, which has
been so successful that the trading floor is to be closed in 1988 (except for
dealing in traded options).
In addition, the Exchange has responded to the new regulatory regime created
by the Financial Services Act 1986 (see p 361), under which all firms wishing to
carry on investment business will need to be authorised through membership of
a self-regulating organisation (SRO), recognised by the Securities and Invest¬
ments Board (SIB) as satisfying criteria defined in the Act. The Council of the
Stock Exchange has therefore joined with the International Securities Regula¬
tory Organisation—itself newly created in response to the Act—to form a
potential SRO known as the Securities Association. The market, furthermore,
has been renamed ‘The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom
and the Republic of Ireland Ltd’, and an application has been made under the
Act for this market to become a recognised investment exchange. (The Financial

Services Act made provision for the SIB to grant such recognition, although
there is no legal requirement for markets to be so recognised.) A further
development in the supervision of share dealings in 1987 was a review of the
non-statutory City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, which led to a strengthen¬
ing of its contacts with other supervisory bodies.
The number and variety of securities (stocks and shares) officially listed on the
Stock Exchange are greater than in any other market in the world and its
turnover of company securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the other
European exchanges combined. Some 6,650 securities are quoted on the Stock
Exchange; at the end of June 1987 these had a market value of £1,693,000
million. About 4,900 securities of companies were quoted including a number of
leading overseas securities. Company issues represent over four-fifths of the
securities at market capitalisation, the remainder being British, Irish Republic
and other overseas government and corporation stocks as well as eurobonds.
A market in traded options, in the shares of prominent British companies,
enables investors not only to buy options to purchase or sell shares in future at
pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves. In May 1984 trading
began in a stock index option and in May 1985 a currency options market came
into operation.
In recent years the largest market for new issues has been that for British
government securities (known as ‘gilt-edged' stocks), although issues of shares
resulting from the Government’s privatisation programme have been more
popular with the investing public. Trading in gilt-edged stocks in the first six
months of 1987 accounted for about two-thirds of transactions by value
(excluding traded options). New issues are made on the Government’s behalf by
the Bank of England.
The Unlisted Securities Market, which deals generally in the securities of small
companies who may not qualify for a full Stock Exchange listing, was opened in
1980 under the auspices of the Stock Exchange, since when the number of
companies with shares traded has risen from about a dozen to over 400. The
Stock Exchange also set up a ‘third tier’ market for securities in small unlisted
companies in February 1987. This will provide a formal structure for trading in
a number of securities, particularly those of small companies trying to raise risk
capital. At present much of this activity is carried out directly with securities
dealers in the ‘over-the-counter’ market.
The London money markets channel wholesale funds (mainly short-term) from
lenders to borrowers. They consist of a series of integrated groups of financial
institutions conducting negotiations primarily by telephone, telex and auto¬
mated dealing systems, there being no physical market-place. Under the
Financial Services Act 1986 (see p 361) the Bank of England will approve market
participants and will ensure that they adhere to codes of conduct. The discount
houses (see p 366) play an important role as principals and transactions may
also be negotiated through money broking firms. The main financial instru¬
ments dealt in are bills (issued by the Treasury, local authorities or companies),
certificates of deposit (CDs) and short-term deposits. The bill markets and the
markets on which the discount houses borrow from the rest of the banking
system are often referred to as the ’traditional’ markets. Newer markets, known
as ‘parallel’ markets, emerged in the 1960s, and include the inter-bank market
and the market in CDs. Since a large proportion of the latter are held by banks
the CD market is effectively an extension of the inter-bank market.
Capital markets have been undergoing continuous transformation since the
1960s (see p 361). In the 1980s there has developed a trend towards the
‘securitisation of debt’; that is to say, that major borrowers have increasingly

raised funds by issuing securities instead of seeking bank loans. In 1986 large
companies in Britain were permitted to develop a sterling commercial paper
market; this consists essentially of issues of short-term debt, and enables
companies to borrow directly from the money market instead of approaching a
bank as an intermediary.
The eurocurrency market enables banks to deal in deposits and loans
denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the bank is
situated. Transactions can thus be carried out in eurodollars, eurodeutsch-
marks, euroyen and so on. While Paris is the main centre for the eurosterling
market, London and Tokyo are the main world centres for eurocurrencies.
The eurobond market performs a similar service in transferring funds from
lenders to borrowers but over a longer period by means of bonds issued in
currencies other than that of the issuing country. Transactions in both markets
tend to be in large denominations. The markets developed in the late 1950s
following the restoration of convertibility between the major currencies, partly in
order to avoid incurring the costs of exchange control and other regulations. The
participants in the markets include multinational corporations, nationalised
industries, and central and local governments as well as the international
banking community.
In the 1980s, there has been considerable growth in the euro-commercial
paper market. As with the establishment of the sterling commercial paper
market (see above) this represents a further movement towards the securitisa¬
tion of debt.
The market has no physical centre, but consists of telephone links between the
participants, which include banks, other financial institutions and several
firms of foreign exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the
banks. It provides those engaged in international trade and investment with
foreign currencies for their transactions. The banks are in close contact with
financial centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both
spot and forward delivery in a wide range of currencies and maturities. The
forward market enables traders who, at a given date in the future, are due to
receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to contract in advance to
sell or buy the foreign currency involved for sterling at a fixed exchange rate. A
Bank of England survey in 1986 showed that average daily turnover on London’s
foreign exchange market was about £60,000 million, making it the largest such
market in the world.
The London International Financial Futures Exchange trades on the floor of the
Royal Exchange building. Over 200 banks and other financial institutions are
members of the market, which allows parties who could be affected by
movements in interest rates or exchange rates to reduce their vulnerability. The
average number of contracts traded daily is well over 25,000. Trading takes place
in financial instruments of differing maturities and denominated in a number
of currencies.
Anyone may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the
hands of the five members of the London gold market, who meet twice daily to
establish a London fixing price for gold. This price provides a reference point for
world-wide dealings. Although much interest centres upon the fixings, active
dealing takes place throughout the day. London and Zurich are the main world
centres for gold dealings.

Commodity,

Markets
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London relate
to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The need for
close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance services
often determined the location of these markets in the City of London. There are
also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and barley), rubber, soya
bean meal, sugar, pigmeat, non-ferrous metals (aluminium, copper, lead,
nickel, silver and zinc), potatoes, gas oil (heating oil) and crude petroleum oil.
The markets are collaborating in the development of new arrangements to
safeguard participants.
In ship brokerage, London's Baltic Exchange is responsible for a substantial
proportion of the world's tramp fixtures. A freight futures market came into
operation there in 1985. All Britain’s agricultural futures markets are operated
from the Baltic Exchange and physical commodity trading is also carried out
there.
19 Overseas Trade
VISIBLE
TRADE
Although small in area and accounting for only about 1 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area,
which accounts for about one-third of all trade.
Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the economy for hundreds of
years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century, when the rapid growth
of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied by Britain’s development
as an international trading centre. Exports of goods and services in 1986 were
equivalent to over one-quarter of gross domestic product. Britain is a major
supplier of machinery, vehicles, aerospace products, electrical and electronic
equipment and chemicals, and a significant oil exporter. It relies upon imports
for about one-third of total consumption of foodstuffs, and for many of the basic
materials needed for its industries. Trade in invisibles is also of great
significance to the economy: in 1986 overseas earnings from services were
equivalent to over one-third of those from total visible exports.
In 1986 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £72,800 million and its
imports of goods at some £81,100 million on a balance of payments basis (see
Table 43). Between 1985 and 1986 both exports and imports increased in
volume terms (by 3-7 per cent and 6-3 per cent respectively) but, with a
pronounced fall in the price of the unit value indices for exports and fuels,
imports declined (by 4-8 per cent and 7-7 per cent respectively). For exports, this
fall was sufficient to bring about a decline of 6-7 per cent in total value; for
imports, it had the effect of restricting the rise in total value to 1 -0 per cent.

Commodity
Composition
Britain has traditionally been an exporter of manufactured goods (both
semi-manufactures and finished manufactures) and an importer of food and
basic materials. However, in recent years manufactures have accounted for a
falling proportion of exports with fuels increasing their share (although in 1986,
when the oil price fell, the proportion of manufactures in total exports rose
sharply) while finished manufactures have accounted for a rising proportion of
imports. The share of manufactures in total exports fell from 84 per cent in 1970
to 75 per cent by 1986 while that of finished manufactures in total imports rose
from 23 per cent to 47 per cent. Machinery and transport equipment account for
one-third of exports and a similar proportion of imports. Export sectors that
have declined in relative importance include textiles and vehicles. Textiles
accounted for 5 per cent of total exports in 1970 but only 2 per cent by 1986; the
corresponding figures for vehicles were 11 per cent and 5 per cent. Over the
same period, the share of food, beverages and tobacco in total imports fell from
22 per cent to 12 per cent and that of basic materials from 16 per cent to 6 per
cent.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has made a significant contribution to
Britain’s overseas trade both in terms of exports and in terms of import

substitution. Exports of fuels in 1986 were, in volume, more than five times
their level of 1975 while imports were less than two-thirds their 1975 level. Over
this period the share of fuels in total exports changed from 4 per cent to 12 per
cent and in imports from 18 per cent to 7 per cent. From the mid-1980s, with
North Sea oil production approaching a peak, the rate of increase in exports of
fuels has slowed. In 1986 the sharp fall in oil prices meant that fuels declined as
a share of total exports.
Since the early 1960s Britain’s imports of semi-manufactures have exceeded
those of basic materials, reflecting the increasing tendency for producing
countries to carry out the processing of primary products up to the semi¬
finished and, on occasions, the finished stage. The fall in the share of food
imports (from around 35 per cent of total imports in the 1950s to 10 per cent by
1986) is a result both of the increasing extent to which food demand has been
met from domestic agriculture and the decline in the proportion of total
expenditure devoted to food.
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly—and increasingly—with other developed
countries. In 1970 these accounted for 73 per cent of Britain’s exports and a
similar proportion of Britain’s imports; by 1986 the shares were 79 per cent and
85 per cent respectively. Around half of Britain’s trade is now with the other 11
countries of the European Community; in 1972 (the year before Britain joined
the Community) the proportion had been one-third. Trade with other Common¬
wealth countries has declined in importance.
European Community countries accounted for seven of the top ten export

16 per cent of Britain’s imports. There have been a number of changes in the
trends of Britain’s overseas trade in recent years. The increase in wealth of the
oil-exporting countries during the 1970s led to a sharp increase in their imports
from all sources; by the early 1980s they were taking some 12 per cent of
Britain’s exports. There was then a fall in the capacity of these countries to
absorb imports so that, by 1986, their share of Britain’s exports had fallen to
less than 8 per cent. In 1973 the oil-exporting countries supplied 10 per cent of
Britain’s imports but, with Britain achieving self-sufficiency in oil, the
proportion had fallen to 2 per cent by 1986. Japan now accounts for around
6 per cent of Britain’s imports, more than twice the proportion of ten years
previously.

a On an overseas trade statistics basis. Exports are f.o.b.; imports c.i.f.
Transactions on invisible trade fall into three main groups: services (receipts
and payments arising from services, as distinct from goods, supplied to and
received from overseas residents); interest, profits and dividends (income
arising from outward and inward investment, loans and other capital transac¬
tions); and transfers between Britain and other countries.
Invisible trade is of fundamental importance to Britain’s economy; overseas
earnings from invisibles amounted to £76,200 million in 1986. Britain’s
earnings are usually exceeded only by those of the United States and France.
Britain’s surplus is normally second in size to that of the United States though
some way behind it. Services have been in surplus for over 20 years while
interest, profits and dividends have rarely been in deficit; transfers, however.

have almost always been in deficit. For invisible trade as a whole, the deficit of
general government is more than offset by the substantial surplus of the private
sector (including public corporations), to give an overall surplus. General
government transactions are relatively unimportant in either the services or the
interest, profits and dividends accounts but they form the greater part of the
transfers account. In 1986 the private sector had a surplus of £12,100 million
on invisible trade while government had a deficit of £4,500 million. The British
Invisible Exports Council, which is financed almost entirely by contributions
from the private sector, promotes measures to encourage invisible trade.
Earnings from private sector services rose in value by 4 per cent in 1986 to
reach £24,500 million. Debits, at £18,000 million, were 7 per cent higher. The
surplus was slightly lower than in 1985, an improvement in the performance of
sea transport and financial and other services being more than offset by a
movement from surplus into deficit of the civil aviation and travel accounts.
The surplus on private sector interest, profits and dividends was £5,600
million in 1986. Earnings on portfolio investment (investment in overseas
securities) rose by 13 per cent above their 1985 level to £5,700 million, reflecting
in part the continuing growth in overseas investment following the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979 and changes in the method of foreign currency
lending by banks located in Britain.
The surplus on private sector transfers in 1986 was £42 million while
government transfers were in deficit by £2,235 million mainly as a result of
contributions and subscriptions to the European Community and other
international organisations and bilateral aid.

Britain remains committed to the open multilateral trading system and to the
further liberalisation of world trade. To this end it has taken a leading part in
the activities of such organisations as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic
380

Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, and has given full support to the new round of
multilateral trade negotiations (see below). Since joining the European Com¬
munity in 1973, Britain has conducted its external commercial policy through
the Community, which has legal competence in this area. Britain has
consistently sought liberalisation of the Community’s internal market and
has been pressing for action to be taken on the harmonisation of technical
standards, the reduction of frontier formalities and the establishment of a free
market in services. The Community’s common customs tariff is, at an average of
7 to 8 per cent, at a similarly low level to the tariffs of other major industrialised
countries.
Tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade have been considerably reduced in the
seven rounds of multilateral trade negotiations completed since 1947 under the
auspices of the GATT, the most recent being the Tokyo Round (1973—79).
Britain participates in these negotiations as a member of the European
Community. In 1982 the GATT devised a programme to liberalise and expand
trade. GATT members also agreed to make determined efforts to ensure that
trade policies and measures were consistent with the principles and rules of the
GATT, and to resist protectionist policies in formulating and implementing
national trade policies. Britain has contributed to the implementation of the
GATT programme; it is particularly concerned that the multilateral approach
should be extended to trade in services, which is of great importance to Britain’s
employment and overseas earnings. The eighth round of GATT multilateral
trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was launched in September 1986. It is
scheduled to last for four years and aims to achieve further liberalisation and
expansion of world trade; the negotiations will pay particular attention to
strengthening the GATT and to trade in agricultural products and trade in
services.
Britain applies the common customs tariff to all countries neither belonging to,
nor having any special arrangement with, the European Community. There is
duty-free trade between those member states that joined before 1986. Portugal
and Spain joined at the beginning of that year. Their trade with the rest of the
Community is in a transitional stage: tariffs on industrial products will be
phased out by the start of 1993 but those on certain agricultural products will be
dismantled over a longer period.
The Community has reciprocal agreements with the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) countries (Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland), which allow for industrial products to be traded free of duty.
Following the Luxembourg Declaration of 1984, the Community and EFTA are
working towards closer economic co-operation.
The Community also has reciprocal preferential trading agreements with
Cyprus, Israel, Malta and Turkey and non-reciprocal agreements with Algeria,
Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yugoslavia and, under the
third Lome Convention, a group of 66 African, Caribbean and Pacific developing
countries. The Lome Convention gives these countries free access (subject to
certain safeguards) to the Community for industrial goods and most agricul¬
tural products.
Tariff preference is also given to developing countries (under the Generalised
Scheme of Preferences), the Faroe Islands and the overseas dependencies and
territories of member states.
The Community also has economic co-operation agreements with a number of
Latin American countries, with China and with the six members of the
Association of South East Asian Nations.

Britain maintains few restrictions on its international trade. Most goods may be
imported freely and only a narrow range of goods is subject to any sort of export
control.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has progressively removed almost all quantita¬
tive import restrictions imposed on economic grounds. The few remaining
quantitative restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in view of the rapid
contraction of the domestic textile industry) and stem primarily from the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) under which there exists a series of agreements
covering international trade in textiles, designed to balance the interests of both
exporting and importing countries. The present MFA is due to expire in 1991.
The Department of Trade and Industry, in accordance with European Commu¬
nity directives, operates a ban on the import from South Africa of certain iron
and steel products and gold coins. Quantitative restrictions have been removed
from imports of goods of Community origin (except for restraints for a transi¬
tion period on imports of certain categories of textile product from Portugal and
Spain). However, there are exceptions: the Department of Trade and Industry
continues to apply internationally recognised restrictions on non-economic
grounds on imports from all countries of products such as firearms, ammuni¬
tion and nuclear materials. Other government departments apply similar
non-economic restrictions on goods such as meat and poultry, animals, birds,
bees, fish and plants and some of their derivatives, controlled drugs, explosives,
certain citizens’ band radios and indecent or obscene articles.
The great majority of British exports are not subject to any government control
or direction. However, there are controls governing exports of military equip¬
ment and industrial goods of strategic significance as well as nuclear products
and certain metals, and metal scrap. There are also controls, for health
certification purposes, on cattle, swine and certain meat exported to another
member state of the European Community: endangered species of animals and
plants and some of their derivatives, in accordance with international agree¬
ments: photographic material over 60 years old and valued at £400 or more per
item and other articles over 50 years old (including works of art) valued at
£16,000 or more (£4,000 or more in the case of British historical portraits):
controlled drugs; British spirits (beverages) in casks of less than 40 litres: and
Common Agricultural Policy products.
The Government assists exporters by creating conditions favourable to the
export trade and by providing information and advice about opportunities for
trade in other countries, services designed to help exporters and improve
exporting practices, and credit insurance facilities.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assist¬
ance to British exporters in appointing agents and researching potential
markets overseas, help at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in trade missions. It mainly comprises repre¬
sentatives of commerce and industry with personal involvement in exporting,
but also includes representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry, the
Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), and the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office: it operates under the general authority of the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, who is the president.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the regional offices of
the BOTB throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts

of the British Diplomatic Service overseas. The Scottish Export Office (Industry
Department for Scotland), the Welsh Office and the Industrial Development
Board for Northern Ireland (Department of Economic Development) also act as
BOTB regional offices.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department provides credit insurance for about
one-quarter of the country’s export trade and insures exporters of both goods
and services against non-payment by overseas buyers. The main risks covered
include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer, governmental action which
stops the British exporter receiving payment, new import restrictions, and war
or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover may commence from the date
of shipment or from the date of contract (at higher premiums).
This insurance may be supplemented by guarantees of repayment given direct
to banks financing exports sold on credit of two years or more, whether in
sterling or in foreign currencies. Alternatively, for contracts over £1 million, the
ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling them to pay on
cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed buying programme of
an overseas country. The banks provide finance against these guarantees. The
ECGD is also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the
commercial market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over
£250,000. Investment insurance is provided for new British investment
overseas against expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Under the Aid and Trade Provision, aid combined with export credits may be
provided to developing countries to support projects which promise opportuni¬
ties to British exporters.
The balance of payments statistics record transactions between residents of
Britain and non-residents. The transactions are classified into two groups:
current account (visibles and invisibles) and transactions in assets and
liabilities. The balance on current account shows whether Britain has had a
surplus of income over expenditure.
Traditionally Britain has had a deficit on visible trade and a surplus on trade
in invisibles and this was again the case in 1986. However, in 1980, 1981 and
1982 visible trade was also in surplus. The surplus on invisibles rose from
£5,100 million in 1985 to £7,600 million in 1986. Although there was a slight
decline in the surplus on services (as the civil aviation and travel accounts
moved into deficit), there was a sharp increase in the surplus on interest, profits
and dividends (with a rise in overseas earnings from portfolio investment and a
pronounced fall in the earnings in Britain of overseas oil companies), and a
decline in the deficit on transfers (which was more than accounted for by the fall
in the deficit on government transactions with European Community institu¬
tions).
A description of visible trade and invisible transactions is given on pp 375-9.
Britain’s exchange controls were abolished during 1979 and residents are free to
acquire foreign currency for any purpose including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. Controls on the lending of sterling abroad have also been
removed and non-residents may freely acquire sterling for any purpose. Gold
may be freely bought and sold. The abolition of exchange controls means that
Britain meets its full obligations on capital movements under the OECD Code on
Capital Movements and under European Community directives. The Govern¬
ment welcomes both outward and inward investment. Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports, while providing earnings in the
form of interest receipts, profits and dividends. Foreign investment in Britain
creates employment directly; introduces new technology, products, manage-

In 1986 direct investment overseas by British residents was £11,400 million.
British residents’ portfolio investment overseas totalled £22,900 million, most
of which was investment by banks and other financial institutions located in
Britain. The inflow of direct and portfolio investment into Britain amounted to

External Assets
and Liabilities
At the end of 1986 Britain’s identified external assets exceeded identified
external liabilities by £114,400 million; only Japan had higher net external
assets. Britain’s private sector net assets were estimated at £107,700 million
and public sector net assets at £6,700 million.1
Direct investment overseas by British residents (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies) totalled £90,800 million at the end of
1986 and portfolio investment £145,700 million. At the end of 1984 (the latest
year for which data are available) over four-fifths of direct investment was in
developed countries. More than one-third of the total was in the United States
and over one-fifth in the European Community. In terms of industries,
manufacturing accounted for 28 per cent of direct investment holdings. By type
of company, oil companies were responsible for 32 per cent, insurance
companies for 7 per cent and banks for 1 per cent.
Direct investment in Britain by overseas residents amounted to £48,600
million at the end of 1986 and portfolio investment to £42,900 million. At the
end of 1984 investment from developed countries accounted for virtually all of
overseas direct investment in Britain. Fifty-one per cent originated in the United
States and 30 per cent in the European Community. Forty-one per cent was in
manufacturing. Oil companies were responsible for 34 per cent, insurance
companies for 2 per cent and banks for 8 per cent.
1 The significance of any inventory of Britain's aggregate external assets and liabilities is limited
because a variety of claims and obligations are included that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree
of liquidity and in method of valuation.

Government
and Scientific
Research
Promotion
of Science and
Technology
Britain has for centuries encouraged research and innovation, and its record of
achievement in relation to size of population is in many respects unsurpassed.
This record has been maintained throughout the twentieth century. For
example, fundamental contributions to modern molecular genetics were made
by the working out of the structure of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) by Professor Francis Crick, Professor Maurice Wilkins, and an American
colleague, James Watson, at Cambridge University in 1952. More recent
achievements include the research carried out by Mr Patrick Steptoe and Dr
Robert Edwards which made possible the birth of the world s first test-tube baby
in Britain in 1978, and work on brain and body scanners (based on
computerised X-ray readings, nuclear magnetic resonance or ultrasonics) and
on monoclonal antibodies (used to diagnose animal diseases and which have the
potential to combat human virus diseases). Other notable contributions in
recent years have been made by Professor Stephen Hawking on black holes
(hypothetical regions of space) and Professor Frederick Sanger on molecular
biology. Nobel prizes for science have been won by 68 British citizens, a number
exceeded only by the United States, and Table 49 lists British citizens who have
won Nobel prizes for science (excluding economic science) since 1970.
Total expenditure in Britain on research and development in 1985 was about
£7,900 million, 2-2 per cent of the gross domestic product. About 40 per cent
was provided by industrial enterprises, with a significant contribution also
being made by private endowments, trusts and charities. Nationalised and
private sector industries finance their own research programmes, and many run
their own laboratories.
The Government finances about half of the total expenditure on research and
development in Britain, of which roughly a quarter is carried out in government
research establishments. Government finance for research and development
also goes to industry and the universities.
Expenditure on research and development in industrial enterprises in 1985
was £5,146 million, of which £1,193 million came from public sector funds,
£575 million from overseas and the balance of nearly £3,400 million from the
domestic private sector. The main areas of expenditure were electronics (£1,738
million), chemicals and allied products (£942 million), aerospace (£845 million),
motor vehicles (£372 million) and mechanical engineering (£269 million).
Considerable expenditure is directed towards applied research and the develop¬
ment of new or improved materials, products and processes. In many areas
Britain participates in European and other international projects.
The main objectives of the Government’s expenditure on research and develop¬
ment are to advance scientific knowledge and develop technology in Britain as
well as to support its own activities. Generally the Government seeks to enhance

Priorities in science and technology policy are decided by collective ministerial
consideration under the leadership of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is
advised on such matters by her Chief Scientific Adviser, Cabinet Office, and
also, since July 1987, by the Advisory Council on Science and Technology
(ACOST), which incorporates the former Advisory Council for Applied Research
and Development (ACARD). The remit of ACOST covers defence as well as civil

research and both academic science and industrial research and development.
ACOST is composed of independent members from industry, academia and
government, and ex-officio members are the chairmen of the Advisory Board for
the Research Councils (ABRC), the Technology Requirements Board (TRB) and
the University Grants Committee (UGC). It advises on national priorities in
science and technology, on the application of the results of scientific research,
on the co-ordination of government policy for science and technology, and on
Britain’s participation in international scientific projects.
Responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, who is advised by the ABRC; that for technology rests
mainly with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who is advised by the
TRB. Other departments with a substantial involvement in science and
technology have a Departmental Advisory Body; these bodies work closely with
ACOST. A committee of Departmental Chief Scientists, under the chairmanship
of the Chief Scientific Adviser, is responsible for co-ordination among depart¬
ments. In July 1986 a Science and Technology Assessment Office, responsible to
the Chief Scientific Adviser, was established to evaluate the impact of
government-funded research on the efficiency and competitiveness of the
economy.
Total government expenditure on research and development in 1987-88 is
planned to be some £4,726 million. The largest departmental research and
development budget is that of the Ministry of Defence. The main civil
departments involved are the Department of Education and Science, which
supports the research councils and the universities; the Department of Trade
and Industry; the Department of Energy; and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland.
The Ministry of Defence’s research programme is undertaken both in the
Ministry’s research establishments and as funded research in industry,
universities and other institutions of higher education. In 1987-88 the Ministry
plans to spend some £2,346 million, of which some £401 million will be for
research and £1,945 million for development. An increasing emphasis is placed
on research funded jointly with industry, and initiatives are also being taken to
encourage ‘spin-off from defence technology to the civil market. For example.
Defence Technology Enterprises Ltd was set up in 1985 by private industry with
government co-operation to identify and promote civil applications of defence
research. ACARD (now ACOST—see p 386) also began a study of this subject in
March 1987. Examples of technological innovations at Ministry of Defence
research establishments include the pioneering work of the Royal Signals and
Radar Establishment on liquid crystal displays, now widely used in the civil
sector, and its current development of a new simpler type of ‘supercomputer
based on Inmos’ transputer chip.
Although most industrial research and development is financed by industry, the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) provides support, some £442 million in
1986—87, to stimulate activities which would bring economic benefits but would
not otherwise be undertaken by industry. The main areas of expenditure are
aeronautics and space (some £193 million in 1986-87), while a wide range of
industrial projects, and technology transfer, awareness, training and advisory
activities is also undertaken. For example, the Department’s Support for
Innovation scheme has helped to finance more than 5,000 industrial research
projects since 1982. Other DTI programmes that have already assisted
388
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
technological innovations include launch aid for the development of aircraft,
such as the A320 Airbus, and the £350 million Alvey Programme for research
into information technology. In December 1986 the Government announced the
LINK programme to co-ordinate various schemes to speed up the application of
pure research to industrial processes. The DTI also plans to set up a National
Advanced Robotics Research Centre during 1987. The Department has four
research establishments: the National Physical Laboratory, the National En¬
gineering Laboratory, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist and the
Warren Spring Laboratory.
The DTI is advised on its support for industrial research and development by
the Technology Requirements Board and 15 Sectoral Advisory Committees,
which consist of representatives of both industry and research organisations.
The DTI maintains close contact with the British Technology Group (BTG), an
independent public corporation which promotes the transfer of technology from
the laboratory to the market-place. The BTG takes responsibility for licensing
inventions, particularly those emanating from universities and other public
sector research organisations; in return it takes a proportion of the licensing
income. It also provides development finance for industrial projects embodying
new technology, for up to 50 per cent of their cost. The loan is repayable through
a levy on sales of resulting products or processes. The BTG is now self-financing
and in 1985-86 earned nearly £18 million, or more than 80 per cent of its
income, from its licensing activities.
In 1987 the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology was being
established, using funds from industry and government, to identify areas of
scientific research that have significant commercial potential.
The
Department of
Education and
Science
The Department of Education and Science discharges its responsibilities for
basic and applied civil science mainly through the five research councils, to
which it allocates funds from its science budget (£657 million in 1987-88). The
councils and their allocations are: the Science and Engineering Research
Council (£350 million), the Medical Research Council (£133 million), the
Natural Environment Research Council (£71 million), the Agricultural and Food
Research Council (£53 million) and the Economic and Social Research Council
(£24 million). Science budget grants are also made to the British Museum
(Natural History), the Royal Society and the Fellowship of Engineering. The
allocations provide support for research in the form of grants and contracts to
universities, polytechnics, research units and other establishments of the
research councils, postgraduate support and subscriptions to international
scientific organisations. The Department is also responsible for some aspects of
international scientific relations and helps to co-ordinate government policy
regarding scientific and technical information. Together with the Scottish
Education Department it funds various schemes for training both students and
those working in industry in the latest technology. For example, under the
Professional, Industrial and Commercial Updating Programme (PICKUP), a
network of nine New Technology Centres is to be established in 1987-88; in
these, scientists from higher education institutions will train employees of
private companies in recent developments in their fields. The Department is also
encouraging, through a variety of initiatives, the teaching in schools of scientific
and technical subjects, such as computing and craft, design and technology.
The Department is also the main source of funding for the universities, whose
individual allocations are determined by the University Grants Committee.
Although each university decides upon the allocation of its resources between
teaching and research, the proportion committed to research is generally
believed to be between 30 and 40 per cent.

The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State on
civil science, particularly with regard to the research council system, on the
support of postgraduate students, on the proper balance between national and
international scientific activities, and on the allocation of the science budget
among research councils and other bodies. It also promotes close liaison
between the councils and industrial users of their research. Its members are
drawn from the research councils, government departments, industry and the
academic world.
Each of the four research councils engaged in scientific research is an
autonomous body established under Royal Charter with membership drawn
from the universities, professions, industry and the Government. They con¬
duct research through their own establishments and by supporting selected
research, study and training in universities and other higher education
establishments. They also receive income for research commissioned by
departments under the customer—contractor principle and from the private
sector. Income from commissioned research is particularly important for the
Agricultural and Food Research Council and the Natural Environment Research
Council.
In 1985 the Government announced new arrangements intended to make it
easier for educational establishments to exploit research carried out with the
support of grants from the research councils. Under the arrangements the
rights and responsibility of commercial exploitation rest with the institution
receiving the grant, subject to the existence of procedures agreed with the
sponsoring research council. Universities and research institutes may still make
use of the expertise of the British Technology Group (see p 388) to patent and
license their inventions, but are no longer obliged to do so.
The Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) is responsible for the
support of research work and postgraduate training in pure and applied science
(including engineering) outside the areas of agriculture, medicine and the
environment. SERC spends about £100 million each year on grants to support
research. Within higher education establishments it encourages collaboration
with industry, partly by sponsoring co-ordinated research programmes in areas
of special concern to industry, such as information technology and biotech¬
nology. Six such areas have been designated and put under the control of
directorates, one of which has been transferred to the private sector. In August
1987 SERC initiated plans for the first in a series of interdisciplinary research
centres. Each centre will be based at a single university or polytechnic but may
also involve researchers from neighbouring higher education institutions in
planned programmes of research in priority areas such as semiconductor
materials, high-temperature superconductivity and lasers in manufacturing.
SERC maintains four research establishments: the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory (RAL) at Chilton (Oxfordshire), which accounts for nearly 10 per cent
of SERC’s budget, the Daresbury Laboratory at Warrington (Cheshire), the Royal
Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux (East Sussex), which is to be moved to
Cambridge in about 1990, and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. The
establishments are centres of specialised research, and are also used for the
development and operation of central experimental facilities beyond the
resources of an individual academic institution. They provide support for
scientists whose research needs access to facilities run by international research
organisations, such as the powerful particle accelerators at the European Centre
for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva and the high-flux neutron source at
the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) at Grenoble. SERC also provides all or part
of Britain’s contribution to these and other international facilities and

organisations such as the European Space Agency (to which funds are
channelled through the British National Space Centre; see p 395).
Among engineering subjects receiving major support are information tech¬
nology (including software engineering, intelligent knowledge-based systems
and device fabrication), radio communications, the application of computers to
manufacturing, biotechnology, marine technology, polymer engineering, mate¬
rials, particulate technology, medical engineering, combustion engines and coal
technology. The Teaching Company Scheme, jointly sponsored by SERC, the
Economic and Social Research Council, the Department of Trade and Industry,
and the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, is currently
supporting some 270 collaborative ventures between academic engineering
departments and industrial companies to improve their manufacturing and
management methods and performance. A network providing an interactive
computing facility to more than 2,000 subscribers in universities is serviced at
RAL.
Britain has a leading position in most major branches of astronomy including
radio astronomy, infra-red astronomy, X-ray astronomy and theoretical re¬
search. In optical astronomy SERC is the principal partner in the international
observatory on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. This contains four
telescopes, including the 4-2-m William Herschel. Opened in 1987, it is the third
largest optical telescope in the world and, with its advanced design and
instrumentation, is capable of detecting fainter and more distant objects than
was previously possible. On Mauna Kea, Hawaii, SERC has a 3-8-m infra-red
telescope, the largest telescope in the world designed specifically to make
infra-red observations, and the 15-m James Clerk Maxwell radio telescope (built
in collaboration with the Netherlands) for observing wavelengths of less than a
millimetre. Much of the observation will eventually be carried out under remote
control from Britain and the Netherlands using computer communications
networks such as the Starlink network based at RAL. The world’s largest X-ray
telescope (aimed at one object) was built by RAL in collaboration with Leicester
University and launched into space on the Japanese-built Ginga satellite (see
p 396) in February 1987, when it was used to investigate a supernova (the
remains of an exploded star), which was the nearest such phenomenon to the
earth for more than 350 years.
In nuclear physics, RAL co-ordinates and supports Britain’s experimental
particle physics research programme and links university researchers with
overseas centres such as CERN in Geneva and DESY, the electron synchrotron
facility in Hamburg. The Daresbury Laboratory offers a 20-million-volt tandem
accelerator for research into nuclear structure, which in 1986 was used, with its
TESSA 3 high-resolution spectrometer, to confirm for the first time a
20-year-old theory that, if rapidly rotated, certain nuclei adopt a ‘superdeformed’
shape.
Support is provided for research in biological and natural sciences, and
mathematics. About 30 per cent of research grant finance in these areas goes to
nine co-ordinated programmes of interdisciplinary strategic research, carried
out in collaboration with industry, in such areas as low-dimensional structures
and protein engineering. SERC also helps to finance the £60 million pulsed
neutron source, ISIS, at RAL, which is now being reconstituted as an
international institute with members from countries including the Federal
Republic of Germany, France and Italy; ISIS allows scientists to ‘look inside’
solids and liquids. The Daresbury Laboratory operates a synchrotron radiation

facility which provides high-intensity electromagnetic radiation used in a wide
range of experiments in protein crystallography, surface physics, chemical
structure and materials science. Other central facilities include a high-powered
laser facility at RAL, which is used to study plasmas. Scientific research funded
by SERC in 1985-86 included developments of ‘superstring’ theories of the
universe in pure mathematics; in optics, the demonstration of lasers operating
very close to X-ray wavelengths; and in thermodynamics, a solution to the
problem of icing on the centre ‘nose cone’ of jet engines.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main government agency for the
support of biomedical research, both at its own centres and by means of grants
to research workers at higher education institutions and hospitals. Its major
research establishments are the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill
Hill, London, the Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, London,
and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge. The Council also has
more than 50 other research units, located in universities and medical schools
throughout Britain.
The MRC’s scientists and doctors have pioneered developments in molecular
biology, therapeutic clinical trials, applied psychology and methods of imaging
the body, such as magnetic resonance and ultrasound. The Council’s larger
research programmes include those into neurological (including Alzheimer’s)
and psychiatric disease, heart and respiratory ailments, infectious diseases
(including AIDS), tropical medicine, and antenatal screening for cystic fibrosis
and muscular dystrophy.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) aims to advance scientific
understanding of the relationship between man and his surroundings through
research in the physical and biological sciences at its own institutes and at
grant-aided institutions, and in universities and polytechnics. NERC’s three
directorates cover (respectively) terrestrial and freshwater, earth and marine
sciences. They are responsible for the Council’s 16 institutes and three
grant-aided associations. The former include the British Antarctic Survey, the
British Geological Survey and the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) and
the latter the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA).
Examples of their work include a new ecologically safe method for monitoring
sea pollution, based on perfluorocarbons, announced by the MBA in 1986, and
GLORIA, a unique side-scan sonar developed at the IOS and now being used for
the United States Geological Survey to map the ocean floor around that country’s
coast.
Research commissioned by public authorities and industry in Britain and
overseas accounts for about one-third of NERC’s income. Applied projects in
progress overseas include those on biological pest control, regeneration of
tropical hardwoods and drip irrigation techniques for tropical crops. NERC also
offers specialist data services providing information on subjects, including
biology and ecology, from satellite and aircraft surveys and its research vessels,
as well as through its various centres and units in Britain.
The Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), together with the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, supports a network of
eight research institutes in Britain collectively known as the Agricultural and
Food Research Service. Over the past two years these institutes have been
reorganised into functional groupings and their number reduced; for example,
the well-known Rothamsted Experimental Station is now part of the Institute of
Arable Crops Research. AFRC institutes have been responsible for a variety of
technological innovations in the 1980s, including the Multiple Ovulation and
392

Parks
Embryo Transfer technique for increasing the rate of genetic improvement of
livestock, the genetic manipulation of crop plants and the development of a
harvester that strips crops in situ, rather than cutting and then stripping them.
The AFRC is also increasing its support for research in further education
institutions. About half of the Council’s income comes from the science budget
and the rest from contract research, mostly for the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food.
Of the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the
academic year 1985—86 (about £780 million), the largest government contribu¬
tion (some £390 million) was through the University Grants Committee (UGC).
Universities are currently being encouraged to direct their resources into those
areas where they have existing research strength or where they see a prospect of
establishing strong groups in new and promising spheres of science and
technology.
Scientific research in the universities and other institutions of higher
education is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, between a quarter and a third of postgraduate students in
science and technology receive maintenance awards from the research councils,
through postgraduate studentships. Secondly, grants and contracts are given to
the universities and other institutions by the research councils for specified
projects, particularly in new or developing areas of research. The other main
channels of support for scientific research in the universities are various
government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the independent
foundations.
Increasingly close relationships are being fostered between the universities,
industry and the Government in numerous joint projects. For example, in June
1987 a new information technology institute, sponsored jointly by industry and
the Cranfield Institute of Technology, was opened to link academic and
commercial spheres. British universities’ earnings from industry and other
outside agencies were £253 million in 1985—86, an increase in real terms of 69
per cent since 1981—82, and are still rising rapidly. The money comes from
research contracts and royalties on the exploitation of university innovations.
Many universities now operate industrial liaison service units, which are linked
together by university directors of industrial liaison.
Technological breakthroughs in the university sector in the 1980s include
optoelectronic devices for future super-fast optical computers at Heriot-Watt
University, near Edinburgh, and techniques for the active cancellation of sound
and other vibrations pioneered at the universities of Cambridge and Essex.
Important research on optical fibres is being carried out at Southampton,
Exeter and Essex universities, on liquid crystal displays at Hull and Manchester,
and on pharmaceutical products and biotechnology at Strathclyde.
Science parks provide an environment for both existing and new businesses
using high technology in which they have easy access to the research expertise
of higher education institutions. At the end of 1986 there were 28 such parks in
operation at or near universities and similar organisations, with a further seven
under construction or planned. One of the first to be established (in 1972) and
still the largest is the Cambridge Science Park, where 65 companies employ
about 2,100 people on a 53-hectare (130-acre) site.
Britain’s science parks now provide accommodation for over 400 companies,
ranging from subsidiaries of large corporations, such as the British Oxygen
Company, Olivetti, British Petroleum and 3M, to a wide variety of new and
recently formed businesses. A recent survey, conducted for the United Kingdom
Science Park Association, showed that companies on parks tended to exhibit

high growth and low failure rates. The main areas in which science park
companies are involved are computing, electronics, instrumentation, robotics,
electrical engineering, chemicals and biotechnology, with the emphasis on
research, design, development, consultancy, testing and training activities
rather than large-scale manufacturing.
Charitable foundations sponsoring research in Britain include: the Cancer
Research Campaign, the Chester Beatty Institute for Cancer Research, the Ciba
Foundation, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Institute for Cancer
Research, the Leverhulme Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation, the Wellcome
Trust and the Wolfson Foundation. In 1986 the largest spenders on medical
research were the Wellcome Trust at £33 million and the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund at £25 million.
The Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations links
together 46 such institutions employing about 9,000 people with a turnover of
about £250 million in 1986. These are limited companies undertaking research
contracts and providing consultancy and training services in particular
branches of industry. In addition to payment for this work, many are supported
by membership fees from firms in their sectors and government grants.
The British Technology Group (see p 388) also finances new technology
projects within the private sector, as do a number of venture capital companies.
For example, in November 1986 Investors in Industry Ltd announced a £60
million programme, in association with Imperial College, London, to set up
centres of innovation at six British universities.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which promote their own disciplines or are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. The Council of Science and Tech¬
nology Institutes has 15 member institutes representing, among others,
engineers, biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists, physicists and
geologists.
The Engineering Council, established in 1981, actively promotes the study of
all types of engineering in schools and other organisations, in co-operation with
its 170 industrial affiliates, including large private companies and government
departments. Together with 46 professional engineering institutions, the
Council accredits courses in higher education institutions. It also maintains a
register of about 300,000 engineers with varying levels of qualifications.
The national academy of engineering in Britain is the Fellowship of
Engineering, set up in 1976, which promotes the discipline and advises the
Government on related policy issues. Its membership consists of distinguished
engineers.
More than 300 learned societies in Britain play an important part in the
promotion of science and technology through meetings, publications and
sponsorship.
The most prestigious of these is the Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal
Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, which is
equivalent to national academies of science in other countries. It is the oldest
such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous existence. The Society
has over 1,000 fellows, many of whom serve on the governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research. The Society is financed
through a parliamentary grant (£6-92 million for 1987—88) and through funds
from private sources (£3-3 million in 1986—87).

The Royal Society recognises scientific and technological achievements
through the award of fellowships, medals and endowed lectureships. It
administers over 160 research appointments, mostly at British universities and
research institutes, at all levels from post-doctoral to professorial. A new
scheme, begun in 1983, provides up to 100 posts in universities for particularly
able young scientists, for whom positions are not currently available. The
Society funds specific research projects and encourages the dissemination of
scientific knowledge by a programme of discussion meetings and through its
publications. In 1986 it established, jointly with the Fellowship of Engineering
(see p 393), a unit to undertake statistical analyses of issues in science policy.
The Society also provides advice on such issues to government and others.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. As the national
academy of science, it represents Britain in a number of international
non-governmental organisations and is involved in a variety of international
scientific programmes. It has bilateral arrangements with academies and
research councils throughout the world, under which a large number of
exchange visits by scientists and collaborative research projects are supported.
Three other major institutions publicise scientific developments through
lectures and publications for specialists and for schoolchildren. Of these, the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, founded in 1831, is mainly
concerned with science, while the Royal Society of Arts, dating from 1754, also
deals with the arts and commerce. The Royal Institution, founded in 1799, also
performs these functions and in addition runs its own research laboratories.
The Zoological Society of London, an independent scientific body, runs the
world-famous London Zoo, which occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s
Park, London. The Society also runs Whipsnade Park Zoo near Dunstable
(Bedfordshire), and is responsible for the Institute of Zoology, which carries out
research in conservation and comparative medicine. It also organises scientific
meetings and symposia, publishes scientific journals and maintains one of the
largest zoological libraries in the world. Other well-known zoos include those at
Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington, Marwell (near Winchester)
and Jersey.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, founded in 1759, cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at
Kew (west London) and a 187-hectare (462-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place,
Ardingly (West Sussex). They contain the largest collections of living and dried
plants in the world. Research is conducted into all aspects of plant life, including
physiology, biochemistry, genetics and the conservation of rare species.
The Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, founded in 1670, is a centre for
research into taxonomy, for the conservation and study of living plants and for
horticultural education.
The British Museum (Natural History) is one of the world’s principal centres for
the general study of natural history, and has a large collection of fossils and
minerals. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied
science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
there is an outstanding collection of exhibits in the Geological Museum. These
three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other important collections
include the Museum of Science and Industry, in Birmingham, the Museum of
the History of Science, at Oxford, and the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.

Activities
Britain is fully involved in the European Community’s programmes for research
and joins with other member states in the co-ordination of particular national
programmes of interest to the Community. For example, British firms are
participating, with government backing, in about half of the projects approved
under the European Strategic Programme of Research into Information
Technology (ESPRIT), the RACE telecommunications study and the BRITE
programme to develop technology within the more traditional industries. In
addition, British companies are involved in many of the projects under Eureka,
the framework for industry-led collaboration in high technology, which also
involves non-Community countries in Europe. Britain is also a member of the
science and technology committees of other international organisations such as
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and various specialised agencies of
the United Nations. In addition, it co-operates with other countries in specific
areas of research, notably nuclear science (see p 390) and space (see p 390).
Britain is party to a number of intergovernmental agreements with other
countries on co-operation in science and technology. Among non-governmental
organisations the five research councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy were founder members of the European Science Foundation in 1974.
There are science and technology sections in the British Embassies in
Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and Moscow, while staff in other British
Embassies and High Commissions also promote contacts in science and
technology between Britain and the countries to which they are accredited.
The British Council fosters co-operation and exchange visits between British
scientists and those of overseas countries to promote among overseas specialists
a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific achieve¬
ments, and, in the developing countries, to identify and manage development
projects in the technological, scientific and educational sectors.
A number of British companies are involved in commercial co-operative
research projects with overseas manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce with
American, Japanese, German and Italian companies for the development of the
V2500 aero-engine, and British Aerospace with various West European firms in
the Airbus and European fighter aircraft projects.
One area in which Britain is particularly involved in international scientific
collaboration is civil space research co-ordinated by the British National Space
Centre. The Government spends about £100 million each year on all space
activities, more than £80 million of which goes towards the work of the
European Space Agency (ESA). The remainder supports a programme of
research and development in government establishments, universities and
companies. In ESA’s space applications programmes, British industry has
led the consortia which have developed all of the communications satellites for
ESA and the main user organisations. The largest ever communications
satellite, Olympus, is under development and is expected to be launched in
1989.
In ESA’s other applications programmes, Britain is developing the main
microwave instrument for an earth observation satellite, ERS-1, to be launched
in 1990. In the Columbus preparatory programme, which is the European
contribution to the international space station proposed by the United States,
Britain is leading the study on a polar-orbiting platform for experimentation and
earth observation.
British groups have been selected to participate in all but one of ESA’s science
missions, including the 1986 launch of the British-built Giotto spacecraft,
which investigated Halley’s Comet, and the Infrared Space Observatory.
396
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Participation in ESA missions is complemented by bilateral arrangements for
space research with other countries, notably the United States through its
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). British groups have
participated in several NASA space science missions, and are currently
developing a payload for NASA’s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. Other
collaborations include the development of the wide field camera for the Federal
Republic of Germany’s X-ray satellite ROSAT and the X-ray sensor for the
Japanese-built Ginga satellite (see p 390). In March 1987 the Government
signed an agreement with the Soviet Union on collaboration in space sciences;
British scientists are taking part in studies relating to the Soviet mission to
Mars and one of its satellites, Phobos.
21 Promotion
of the Arts
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest standards of
professional performance to the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for drama, music, opera
and dance, and festivals held in towns and cities throughout the country attract
much interest. Glasgow, which has developed into an important artistic centre,
has been chosen as European City of Culture for 1990. Many British
playwrights, composers, film-makers, sculptors, painters, writers, actors,
singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy international reputations. Television
and radio play an important role in bringing a wide range of artistic events to a
large audience. At an amateur level, activities which make use of local talent and
resources take many forms: choral, orchestral, operatic, dramatic and other
societies for the arts abound, and increasing numbers of people take an interest
in such crafts as spinning, lace-making and wood-carving. Arts activities
introduced and developed by the ethnic minorities are also flourishing.
Policies The general aim of the Government’s policies for the arts is to encourage public
access to, and enjoyment and appreciation of, artistic activity and the cultural
heritage. This is achieved by assisting the provision and development of the
performing and visual arts; encouraging the arts to increase their income
through better marketing and by attracting contributions from the private
sector; maintaining and enhancing the national museums and galleries;
helping to preserve objects of importance to the national heritage; and
sustaining and developing national collections of literary material, archive and
information stores. The Government is maintaining existing levels of support
for arts activities; encouraging private funding of the arts by various means
including sponsorship; and making the arts more available to people in the
regions. National museums and galleries are encouraged by the Government to
increase their receipts either through trading activities or by making admission
charges. An important concept in its funding policy is the ‘arm’s length
principle’ by which government funds are distributed to arts organisations
indirectly, through bodies such as the Arts Councils and the British Film
Institute; this helps to safeguard against political interference in arts activities.
Administration Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities play an active part, and
a substantial and increasing amount of help also comes from private sources,
including trusts and commercial concerns.
The Minister for the Arts, a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, is
responsible for general arts policy and heads the Office of Arts and Libraries
which administers government expenditure on national museums and art
galleries in England, the Arts Council, the British Library and other national
arts and heritage bodies. Responsibility for the upkeep of ancient monuments
and historic buildings is exercised by the Department of the Environment; the
Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (known as English
398
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Finance
Arts Councils
Heritage) manages 400 ancient monuments and buildings on behalf of the
Secretary of State for the Environment. The regulation of the film industry and
of broadcasting is conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Home Office, respectively. The Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland are
responsible for the national museums, galleries and libraries in their countries,
and for other cultural matters. In Northern Ireland the Department of Education
has responsibility for these affairs.
Local authorities support a wide range of artistic and cultural activities. They
maintain more than 1,000 local museums and art galleries and some 4,000
public libraries; provide grant aid for professional and voluntary organisations
including orchestras and theatre, opera and ballet companies; and undertake
direct promotions through local arts councils. They also contribute to the cost of
new or converted buildings for the arts.
Arts education in schools, colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres is the responsibility of central government education
departments, in partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies.
Planned central government expenditure through the Office of Arts and
Libraries amounts to some £340 million in 1987—88. About 30 per cent of
current expenditure is spent on ten national galleries and museums in England,
about a fifth on the British Library and two-fifths channelled through the Arts
Council to support the performing and visual arts throughout Britain. Grants
are also made to bodies including the British Film Institute, the Crafts Council,
certain other museums, and to the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Fund
provides assistance to organisations wishing to acquire, for the public benefit,
land, buildings, works of art and other objects associated with the national
heritage. Additional central government expenditure on arts and libraries in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland amounts to over £61 million.
Planned spending on the arts and libraries by local authorities in 1987—88 is
about £470 million. Some 80 per cent of current expenditure by the authorities
in England is on the public library service, and the remainder on local museums
and art galleries.
Industrial and commercial concerns offer a vital and growing source of
sponsorship and patronage to a wide range of arts, including exhibitions,
concerts and opera seasons, and are often advised by the Association for
Business Sponsorship of the Arts and the Arts Councils. The Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme was launched by the Office of Arts and Libraries
in Great Britain in 1984, and in 1987-88 it has available £1-75 million to match
new business sponsorships (a similar scheme is to be set up in Northern Ireland
in 1987-88). The value of business sponsorship is currently some £25 million a
year. The Government has announced its intention to extend ‘incentive funding’
in order to encourage arts organisations to raise finance from other sources.
Further support is encouraged by tax concessions which allow companies and
individuals to obtain tax relief on donations to arts charities. An experimental
Arts Marketing Scheme introduced in 1987 with funds of £250,000 was aimed
at helping organisations find ways of increasing their audiences and improving
their financial returns.
The independent Arts Council of Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in
1946, is the main channel for government aid to the performing and visual arts.
Its main objects are to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and
practice of the performing and visual arts, increase their accessibility to the
public, and advise and co-operate with government departments, local authori¬
ties and other organisations. The Council gives financial help and advice to

organisations ranging from the major opera, dance and drama companies,
orchestras and festivals, to small touring theatres and experimental groups. It
encourages such interests as contemporary dance, mime, jazz, literature,
photography and art films, and helps professional creative writers, choreo¬
graphers, composers, artists and photographers by means of a variety of
schemes. It also promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and drama
companies and of contemporary music groups, and provides funds for some
specialist training courses in the arts.
Under a development programme for the next decade, launched in 1984, the
Council is increasing its funding of the arts in the regions. In the first five years
support for new activities is being concentrated in five main areas of the
arts—art, dance, drama, music and education—focusing on 13 main centres of
population throughout England. Greater emphasis is being placed on obtaining
funds through partnership arrangements with local authorities and other
agencies and from commercial sources. Increased funding and responsibilities
are also being given to the regional arts associations (see below).
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies through the
Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils, which are committees of the Arts Council of
Great Britain with a large measure of autonomy. Northern Ireland has an
independent Arts Council with aims and functions similar to those of the Arts
Council of Great Britain.
The Arts Council of Great Britain assumed responsibility for London’s South
Bank arts centre in 1986.
Regional co-operation in development of the arts is encouraged through 15
regional arts associations in England and Wales, which bring together all those
in a region, ranging from local authorities and private companies to local artists,
with an interest in improving the artistic life of their area. Their aim is to ensure
that the arts are more widely available and that artists receive support at
regional as well as national level. They offer financial assistance to artists and
arts organisations, and advise on, and in some cases promote, activities. They
are financed mainly by the Arts Council, the British Film Institute, the Crafts
Council and local authorities, and these interests are represented on their
governing bodies. Business sponsorship is also an increasingly important
source of regional funds.
The community arts movement has grown rapidly over the last decade, the
primary concern of community artists being their impact on a community and
their relationship with it. Using many techniques and performing in a variety of
places their aim is to make people more aware of their circumstances and to help
them develop their creative powers in order to enrich both their own lives and
that of the community.
There is a wide range of arts activities by ethnic minorities which embrace both
the traditional and new forms of artistic expression. In its strategy for
developing the arts over the next decade published in 1984 the Arts Council
identified black and Asian dance and drama as areas that would receive
extra support. The Commonwealth Institute arranges a varied programme of
artistic events and festivals, and the Minority Arts Advisory Service is a national
information and resource centre for the arts of the ethnic minority
communities.
More than 300 arts centres in Britain provide opportunities for enjoyment of
and participation in a range of activities in both the performing and visual arts,
with educational projects becoming increasingly important. All are profession-

ally managed and most are supported by volunteer groups. The centres are
assisted mainly by regional arts associations and local authorities with some
help from the Arts Council and other organisations. Many theatres and art
galleries also provide a focal point for the community by offering facilities for
other arts.
Local arts councils in towns and communities throughout Britain, some of them
founded and supported by local authorities, seek to promote and co-ordinate
arts activities in their localities. Industrial and commercial interests also give
financial help.
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature
overseas and maintains libraries in many of the 80 or so countries in which it is
represented. The Council initiates or supports overseas tours by British theatre
companies, orchestras, choirs, and opera and dance companies, as well as by
individual actors, musicians and artists. It promotes fine arts and other
exhibitions overseas, organises British participation in international exhibi¬
tions and film festivals, maintains film libraries in many of the countries in
which it works, and encourages professional interchange in all cultural fields
between Britain and other countries.
Both BBC radio and television and the independent television companies
broadcast a wide variety of drama (including adaptations of novels and stage
plays), opera, ballet, and music, and general arts magazine programmes and
documentaries. These have won many international awards at festivals such as
the Prix Italia and Montreux International Television Festivals. Independent
television companies also make grants for arts promotion in their regions.
The BBC has orchestras employing many of Britain’s full-time professional
musicians, and each week it broadcasts nearly 100 hours of classical and other
music (both live and recorded) on its Radio 3 channel. Radios 1 and 2 broad¬
cast popular and light music. The BBC regularly commissions new music, par¬
ticularly by British composers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and
festivals. Each summer it presents and broadcasts the BBC Promenade
Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall.
I
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for the 400 or so professional
arts festivals which take place in Britain each year. The Edinburgh International
Festival, featuring a wide range of different arts, is the largest of its kind in the
world and celebrated its fortieth anniversary in 1986. Other annual festivals
held in the Scottish capital include International Folk and Jazz Festivals, while
the Mayfest takes place in Glasgow. Well-known festivals concentrating on music
include the Three Choirs Festival, which has taken place annually for 260 years
in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to
contemporary British music; and the Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Among
others catering for a number of art forms are the Royal National Eisteddfod of
Wales, the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and the festivals in
Belfast, Buxton, Malvern, Chichester, Harrogate, Salisbury, Windsor and York.
Britain is one of the world’s foremost countries for theatre, and has a long and
rich dramatic tradition. As well as companies based in London and other major
cities and towns, numerous touring companies visit a wide range of theatres,
festivals and other venues throughout Britain including arts and sports centres
and working men’s clubs. Contemporary British playwrights who have received
international recognition include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Alan Ayck-

bourn, Caryl Churchill and David Edgar. The musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber
have enjoyed considerable success both in Britain and overseas. Among the
best-known directors are Sir Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Peter Brook, John
Schlesinger and Terry Hands, while the many British performers who enjoy
international reputations include Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Lord (formerly Sir
Laurence) Olivier, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Vanessa Redgrave, Ian
McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons and Glenda Jackson.
British designers such as John Bury, Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are inter¬
nationally recognised.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for professional use which can seat
between 200 and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned, but most are owned
either municipally or by non-profit-distributing organisations. About 50 of
these house resident theatre companies which receive subsidies from the Arts
Council. London is the main focus with a hundred or so West End and suburban
theatres, 15 of which are permanently occupied by subsidised companies. These
include the National Theatre, which stages a wide range of modern and classical
plays in its three auditoria in the South Bank arts centre; the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which, while performing in Stratford upon Avon, also produces plays
mainly by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, as well as modern work, in its
two auditoria in the City’s Barbican Centre; and the English Stage Company at
the Royal Court Theatre, which produces the work of the most talented new
playwrights. Among new theatre projects is one launched in mid-1987 to
reconstruct Shakespeare’s Globe Playhouse on its original Thames-side site.
Outside London most cities and many large towns have at least one theatre;
some, like the Palace Theatre, Manchester, and the Theatre Royal, Nottingham,
date from the nineteenth century and have been handsomely restored. Others,
like the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, and the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been
built to the latest designs. Some universities such as those in Aberystwyth,
Exeter and Newcastle upon Tyne have theatres which house professional
companies playing to the general public. Most regional repertory companies
mount about eight to ten productions a year; some also have studio theatres in
addition to the main auditorium, where they present new or experimental
drama and plays of specialist interest. Repertory theatres also frequently serve
the function of a social centre and meeting place by offering a wide range of
events such as concerts, poetry recitals and exhibitions, and by providing
restaurants, bars and theatre shops. Successful productions from regional
theatre companies often transfer to London’s West End, while the largest
regional theatres receive visits from the National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
A number of companies provide theatre for young audiences. Unicorn Theatre
for Young People and Polka Children’s Theatre, both in London, produce plays
specially written for children, and the Whirligig Theatre tours throughout the
country. The Young Vic Company in London and Contact Theatre Company in
Manchester produce plays for young people. There are numerous Theatre-in-
Education companies which perform in schools for all age ranges and abilities.
Some of these companies operate independently (such as Theatre Centre, which
plays in London and tours further afield), while others are attached to regional
repertory theatres such as the Belgrade in Coventry and the Playhouse in Leeds.
Most regional repertory theatres also mount occasional productions aimed at
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket prices for those at school, college
or university are generally available. There are also a number of puppet
companies.
There has been a marked growth in youth theatres, which now number more
than 500 in England alone; both the National Youth Theatre in London and the

Scottish Youth Theatre in Edinburgh offer early acting opportunities to young
people.
Training for actors and stage managers is provided mainly in drama schools,
among which the best known are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Drama,
and the Drama Centre (all in London), and the Bristol Old Vic School, the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (Glasgow) and the Manchester
Polytechnic School of Drama. There are a number of theatre design courses,
often based in art schools, which train designers for the stage. Several
universities, polytechnics and other colleges offer courses in drama.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies throughout Britain.
Their work is encouraged by a number of bodies, such as the British Theatre
Association, the Central Council for Amateur Theatre, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of
Ulster Drama Festivals. Amateur companies sometimes receive financial sup¬
port from local government, regional arts associations and other bodies.
The widespread interest in classical music in Britain is reflected in the large
audiences at choral and orchestral concerts, at the opera, which is enjoying
increasing popularity, and at performances of dance and chamber music. Rock
and pop music are extremely popular, especially among younger people, while
folk music, jazz, light music and brass bands also have substantial followings.
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are promoted eveiy year in many of the
large towns and cities. The principal concert-halls in central London are the
Royal Festival Hall, next to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room accommodating smaller-scale performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences); the Royal Albert Hall; the Wigmore
Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony (resident at the Barbican Centre), the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Sym¬
phony, and the Ulster and the Scottish National Orchestras. The BBC’s six
orchestras provide broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There
are also specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English
Chamber Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the Academy of
Ancient Music, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle
upon Tyne), the Scottish Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
The London Sinfonietta specialises in performing contemporary music which,
in its various forms, appeals to growing audiences, especially of younger
people. Groups playing early instruments attract interest throughout the
country.
British conductors such as Sir Colin Davis, Sir Neville Marriner and Simon
Rattle reach a wide audience through their recordings as well as by their
performances, and the works of living composers such as Sir Michael Tippett
and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies enjoy international acclaim. The Master of the
Queen’s Music, Malcolm Williamson, holds an office within the Royal Household
with responsibility for organising and writing music for state occasions.
The principal choral societies include the Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society,
the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh Choral Union and the Belfast

Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have close links with
particular choirs. The English tradition of church singing is represented by
choirs such as those of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ Church
Cathedral, Oxford. There are many male-voice choirs in Wales and in certain
parts of England.
Among the characteristics of modern pop and rock music are the diversity of
styles, the frequency with which new styles and stars emerge, and the short
lifespan of many groups. Electric guitars and drums usually provide the
instrumental basis, but there has been an increasing use of brass instruments,
while many groups have adopted synthesisers. In the 1960s and 1970s groups
such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd
achieved international success. British groups continue to have enormous
appeal to audiences throughout the world and often set new trends in music;
some of the more recent groups to have achieved renown are Dire Straits, the
Eurhythmies and Five Star. Well-known performers include David Bowie, Elton
John and Paul McCartney. In recent years black British musicians have made a
large contribution to the development of popular music.
Jazz has an enthusiastic following in Britain and is played in numerous clubs
and public houses. British musicians such as Barbara Thompson, Stan Tracey,
John Surman and Kenny Wheeler have established strong reputations through¬
out Europe. Festivals of jazz music are held annually at Camden (London) and
Bracknell (Berkshire) and at a number of other places.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London. The Royal Opera and Royal Ballet, which rank among the
world’s finest companies, are supported by a permanent orchestra. Seasons of
opera in English are given by the English National Opera at the London
Coliseum and their wide range of productions receive much critical acclaim.
Sadler’s Wells Theatre is the home of Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet and the New
Sadler’s Wells Opera Company, and stages many of the London performances of
visiting opera and dance companies. Scottish Opera (which celebrated its Silver
Jubilee in 1987) has regular winter seasons at the Theatre Royal in Glasgow,
and tours mainly in Scotland and northern England. Welsh National Opera has
seasons in Cardiff and other cities and, with Kent Opera and Opera 80, provides
most of the touring productions in England. Opera North, based in Leeds,
undertakes tours in the north of England and Opera Factory stages experi¬
mental work in opera and music drama. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted
by Opera, Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international casts are specially assembled is held
every summer at Glyndebourne in Sussex; this is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera using different casts.
Dance companies also include: London Festival Ballet, which divides its
performances almost equally between London and the regions; Ballet Rambert
(Britain’s oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading modern
dance company); Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow; London Contemporary
Dance Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in
London besides touring extensively); and Northern Ballet Theatre, based in
Manchester, which also tours widely throughout England. A number of modern
dance groups are supported by regional arts associations and about 30 small
dance and mime groups by the Arts Council. The three Arts Councils also
support individuals and offer commissions to small groups.

Professional training in music is given mainly at colleges of music. The leading
London colleges are the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity College of Music. Outside
London the main centres include the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, the
Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff, and the Birmingham School of
Music. The National Opera Studio provides advanced training courses. The
leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Ballet Rambert School and
the London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools,
have helped in raising British dance to its present high standard. Dance is now
a subject for degree studies at the Laban Centre, the University of Surrey and
Dartington College. Courses leading to work with community groups are
available at three institutions.
Youth and Music, an organisation affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendance by young people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Special performances of orchestral music for children include the
Robert Mayer Concerts, held in London on Saturday mornings. Ludus Dance in
Education Company and Outreach (in the north of England) work mainly with
young people. Scottish Ballet Steps Out works in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestras of Great Britain, of Scotland and of Wales and other
youth orchestras are noted for their high standards. Nearly a third of the players
in the European Community Youth Orchestra come from Britain. There is also a
National Youth Jazz Orchestra.
The British film industry is widely acknowledged to have undergone a revival in
the early 1980s. British films, actors and the creative and technical services
which support them have been achieving notable successes commercially and in
international film festivals and other events. Besides feature films, including
co-productions with other countries, the industry produces films for television
as well as promotional, advertising, industrial, scientific, educational and
training films.
There are about 1,250 cinema screens in Britain and estimated attendances
in 1986 amounted to over 72 million, an increase of over 24 per cent since 1984.
Cinema attendance figures declined rapidly between the mid-1950s and the
early 1980s, a major reason being competition from television. However,
cinema-going started to rise in 1985, partly as a result of British Film Year,
which was successful in promoting the cinema and British films, and in spite of
the growing number of households with video recorders and the greater
availability of films on video. There has also been a growth in recent years in the
number of grant-aided regional film theatres and film societies offering
alternative programmes to those of the commercial cinema chains.
Following a wide-ranging review of the film industry, measures were taken by
the Government in 1985 to remove certain statutory controls on cinemas which
had become outdated and which were no longer contributing to the industry’s
development. British Screen Finance, a private company, whose members are
drawn from the film and television industries, was set up to provide a source of
finance for new film-makers in commercially viable productions who have
difficulty in attracting funding elsewhere. The company, investing its own
money together with contributions from the Government amounting to £10
million over five years, part-finances the production of low- and medium-budget
films involving largely British talent and encourages the early stages of film
project development and the production of short films.

An annual government grant of some £10 million is also made to the British
Film Institute.
The development of film and television as an art form is promoted by the British
Film Institute, founded in 1933, and in Scotland by the Scottish Film Council.
The Institute offers direct financial and technical help through its Film
Production Board to new and experienced film-makers who cannot find support
elsewhere, and helps to fund film and video workshops in liaison with the
Channel Four Television Company. It administers the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive, and has a library from which films and
video-cassettes may be hired. The Institute’s Information Division has extensive
international collections of books, periodicals, scripts, stills and posters. It
offers an information service on all aspects of film and television, and produces a
range of publications, including the British National Film and Video Catalogue,
which records films and video-cassettes available in Britain, and a quarterly
journal, Sight and Sound. The Education Department produces study materials
and offers an advisory service to the growing number of teachers of film and
television at all levels of formal education and in adult education.
The National Film Archive contains over 75,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, and over 10,000 television programmes. The
National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical,
artistic or technical interest, and is unique in offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films. Each autumn it mounts the London Film Festival, at which about 150 of
the finest new films from all over the world are screened.
The British Film Institute has promoted and helps to fund the development of
some 40 regional film theatres, and is involved in establishing film and
television centres with a range of activities and facilities in a number of major
cities. It also co-operates with the regional arts associations and grant-aids their
film activities. In Wales, the Welsh Arts Council acts as the Institute’s agent. In
Scotland, the Scottish Film Council supports regional film theatres, administers
the Scottish Film Archive, and promotes and provides material for media
education. Together with the Scottish Arts Council, it set up the Scottish Film
Production Fund, which makes grants towards film production in Scotland.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
There is an annual festival of film and television in the Celtic countries which is
held in rotation in Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France.
The Children’s Film and Television Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films specially designed for children. In view of the rapid decline
of the children’s matinee movement (only some 50 cinemas now provide
programmes for children on Saturday mornings) the Foundation’s films are
increasingly shown through the medium of video and television.
The National Film and Television School, financed jointly by the Government
and the film and television industry, offers courses for writers, directors,
producers and camera technicians. Training in film production is also given at
the London International Film School, the Royal College of Art, and at some
polytechnics and other institutions.
Cinemas showing films to the public must be licensed by local authorities,
which have a legal duty to prohibit the admission of children under 16 to
unsuitable films, and may prevent the showing of any film. In considering the
suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an indepen¬
dent non-statutory body, the British Board of Film Classification, to which films
406
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Videos
VISUAL ARTS
offered to the public must be submitted. The Board was set up on the initiative
of the cinema industry to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in films
offered to the public. It does not use any written code of censorship, but may
require cuts to be made before granting a certificate; very rarely, it refuses a
certificate. Films passed by the Board are put into one of five categories: U
meaning universal—suitable for all; PG, meaning parental guidance, in which
some scenes may be unsuitable for young children; 15 and 18, for people of not
less than 15 and 18 years of age respectively; and Restricted 18, for restricted
showing only at segregated premises to which no one under 18 is admitted—for
example, licensed cinema clubs.
The British Board of Film Classification is also legally responsible for the
classification of videos. The system of classification is similar to that for films.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants
for municipal museums and galleries, funding for living artists channelled
through the Arts and Crafts Councils, and grants towards the cost of art
education. The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design
and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.
All national museums and galleries are financed mainly from government
funds. They are free to levy entrance charges to their permanent collections,
special exhibitions and outstations at their discretion. Government policy is to
give priority to the conservation of the buildings and collections of the national
institutions rather than to increasing purchase grants for acquisitions. All the
national collections in England, Scotland and Wales are administered by
independent trustees. Museums and art galleries maintained by local authori¬
ties, universities and private benefactions may receive help in building up their
collections through annual government grants administered by the Museums
and Galleries Commission (for England and Wales) and the National Museums of
Scotland. Financial and practical assistance to both national and local
museums and galleries is also given by the Arts Council and by trusts and
voluntary bodies including the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the National
Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society. Pre-eminent works of
art accepted by the Government in place of inheritance tax are allocated to public
galleries. Financial help may also be available from the government-financed
National Heritage Memorial Fund; in recent years, the Fund has
made important contributions towards pictures purchased by the Birmingham,
Leeds and Manchester City Art Galleries, and by the national galleries and
museums.
Support given by the Arts Council, in co-operation with regional arts
associations, includes grants towards the public presentation of art, especially
contemporary and experimental works, publication of books and magazines,
and the commissioning of works of art in public places. It administers the
Serpentine Gallery in London while the South Bank Board, a committee of the
Council, maintains a collection of contemporary British art and organises
exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery in London and throughout the country. The
Council also supports a number of art and photography galleries in London and
the regions, such as the Arnolfini in Bristol and the Museum of Modern Art in
Oxford and provides support for artists and photographers through purchasing
and commissioning fellowships and residences. Similar support is given by the
Scottish Arts Council to galleries in Scotland such as the Fruitmarket Gallery in
Edinburgh. The Welsh and Northern Ireland Arts Councils have galleries in
Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors and painters have high international

reputations, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. Among the best known are the late Hemy Moore,
Elisabeth Frink, Francis Bacon and David Hockney.
A major expansion in the number of museums is taking place and many are
introducing new display techniques that attract increasing numbers of visitors.
Over 68 million people a year attend the 2,000 or so museums and galleries open
to the public, which include the major national collections and a wide variety of
municipally and independently or privately owned institutions.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Museums and Galleries
Commission, which also promotes co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Nine area museum councils provide technical services and advice
on conservation, display, documentation and publicity.
The independent Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries
and their staffs belong and which also has many overseas members, is a
focus for the collection of information and discussion of matters relating to
museum administration, and a training and examining body for professional
qualifications. It also manages a comprehensive, publicly available database on
British museums and has an active publishing programme.
The national museums and art galleries, which are mostly located in London,
contain some of the world’s most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest. They are the British
Museum (including the Museum of Mankind), the British Museum (Natural
History), the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the National
Maritime Museum, the Wallace Collection, the Geological Museum and a group
of museums and galleries on Merseyside. Some of the museums in London have
branches outside London, examples being the National Railway Museum (York)
and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (Bradford) which
are part of the Science Museum.
New developments at the Tate Gallery include the opening in 1987 of the Clore
Gallery to house the paintings bequeathed to the nation by J. M. W. Turner,
plans for the construction of a further arts complex and the opening of an
outstation in Liverpool, to be called Tate in the North, in 1988. An extension to
the National Gallery, to be financed by the Sainsbury family, has also been
announced. A national theatre museum opened in 1987 in Covent Garden,
London.
In Scotland the national collections are the National Museums of Scotland
(formed by the bringing together in October 1985 of the Royal Scottish Museum
and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and embracing the
Scottish United Services Museum in Edinburgh Castle) and the National
Galleries of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The
National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St Fagan’s Castle where
the Welsh Folk Museum is housed, an Industrial and Maritime Museum in
CardifFs dockland, the Museum of the Woollen Industry at Drefach Felindre, and
the North Wales Quarrying Museum at Llanberis. Northern Ireland has two
national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down.
Other important collections in London include the Royal Armouries in the Tower
of London, the Museum of London, Sir John Soane's Museum, the Courtauld

collection and the London Transport Museum. The Queen’s Gallery in Bucking¬
ham Palace has exhibitions of pictures from the extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local authorities but sometimes by local
learned societies or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge are
rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities, such as the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the world, and the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Many private art collections in historic
family mansions, including those owned by the National Trusts, are open to the
public, while an increasing number of open air museums depict the regional life
of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for example, the Weald and
Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England Open Air Museum in
Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire). Skills of the past
are revived in a number of ‘living’ museums like the Gladstone Pottery Museum
near Stoke on Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire. Among the
newest museums are the National Horseracing Museum at Newmarket, the
Jorvik Viking Centre, a reconstruction of the Viking settlement in York, and a
new maritime museum in Portsmouth, housing the restored wreck of the Mary
Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, which sank in 1545 and was raised in 1982. The
new Burrell gallery in Glasgow houses a world-famous collection of tapestries,
paintings and objets dart. A new Museum of the Moving Image, due to open on
the South Bank of the Thames in 1988, will feature exhibitions of moving
images ranging from ancient shadow plays, through television and video, to
images produced using optic fibres and lasers.
Apart from their permanent collections, most museums and galleries stage
temporary exhibitions on particular themes. There are also a number of national
art exhibiting societies, the most famous of which is the Royal Academy of Arts
at Burlington House. The Academy holds an annual Summer Exhibition, in
which the works of hundreds of professional and amateur artists are included,
and important exhibitions during the rest of the year. The Royal Scottish
Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are also children’s
exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Government aid for the crafts, amounting to just over £2 million in 1987—88, is
administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Council. The Council supports
artist craftsmen and women by promoting interest in their work, making it
accessible to the public and encouraging the creation and appreciation of
articles of fine craftsmanship. Grants are available to assist with training,
setting up workshops and acquiring equipment; the Council maintains a
selective index of craftsmen and women and a non-selective national register; it
arranges exhibitions and seminars and circulates information. It publishes a
range of literature, including the Crafts magazine, issued every two months. The
Council also manages a British crafts shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Funding is given to the Welsh Arts Council and the regional arts associations in
England for the support of crafts, and also to Contemporary Applied Art, a
membership organisation which holds exhibitions and sells work through its
London gallery.
Scotland receives a separate government grant which is administered by the
Crafts Consultative Committee of the Scottish Development Agency.
Most practical education in art and design is provided in colleges of art (among
the best known of which are the Slade School and the Royal College of Art, both
in London), further education colleges and private art schools. Four art colleges
in London (Camberwell, Central, Chelsea and St Martin’s) were merged in
January 1986 with other colleges to form the London Institute. Degrees at

postgraduate level are awarded by the Royal College of Art. Art is also taught at
an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities and polytechnics concentrate largely on academic
disciplines such as the history of art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the University of London and the
Department of Classical Art and Archaeology at University College, London. Art
has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through Art
encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original works of
art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition.
London is a major centre for the international art market, and sales of works of
art take place in the main auction houses (two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through private dealers. Certain items are
covered by export control. These are: works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £16,000 or more (£4,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits); photographic material over 60 years old and worth £400 or
more apiece; and documents, manuscripts and archives over 50 years old,
irrespective of value. A licence is required before such items can be exported.
The application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade and
Industry, and, if the Department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding
of a licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of
Works of Art. If the Committee considers a work to be of national importance it
can advise the Government to withhold the export licence for a specified time to
give a public museum or art gallery an opportunity to buy at a fair price.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools and of most
colleges and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
private libraries and several private literary societies. Book reviews are featured
in the press and on television and radio and there are numerous periodicals
concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is provided
by a number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith & Son, and
Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage young writers include those of the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory Trust Fund. Many
British writers are internationally recognised and in 1983 the Nobel prize for
literature was awarded to the novelist William Golding. Other well-known living
authors are Graham Greene, Anthony Burgess, Margaret Drabble and Iris
Murdoch, while distinguished British poets include Ted Hughes, Seamus
Heaney, Gavin Ewart and Elizabeth Jennings. Ted Hughes is Poet Laureate, a
member of the Royal Household who writes verse to mark royal occasions in
return for a small stipend.
A public lending right scheme, introduced in 1982, gives registered authors
the right to receive payment from a central fund (totalling £2-75 million in
1987-88) for the use of their books borrowed from public libraries.
The author of any original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is
automatically protected by the Copyright Act 1956 and its related international
conventions1 from the unauthorised reproduction of the work both before and
after publication. The author of the work is the first owner of the copyright, and
the normal term of copyright in published original works is the life of the author
and a period of 50 years after his or her death.
1 A copyright work first published in Britain has automatic copyright in all countries which are
members of the Berne Copyright Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention. The law on
copyright is under review.

Libraries
Societies to promote literature include the English Association and the Royal
Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the British Academy) is the leading
society for humanistic studies.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, the largest of which is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies, such as the Poetry Society, sponsor
poetiy readings and recitals. There are also a number of clubs and societies,
such as the Poetry Book Society, which distribute selected new books to their
members.
The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and ranks with
the National Library of Congress in Washington and the Bibliotheque Nationale
in Paris as one of the world's greatest libraries. Publishers have a legal obligation
to supply the Library with a copy of each new book, pamphlet or newspaper
published in Britain. The Humanities and Social Sciences division provides
comprehensive information and reference services based on its world-famous
collections of some 12 million items of monographs, manuscripts, maps,
stamps, newspapers and recorded sound. The Library’s exhibition galleries are
housed in the British Museum building, where many of the Library’s greatest
treasures are on permanent display and temporary exhibitions are regularly
mounted.
The British Library Science, Technology and Industry division comprises the
Document Supply Centre in West Yorkshire and the Science Reference and
Information Service in London. The former operates a rapid postal inter-library
lending service of journals and photocopies and satisfies some 3 million
requests each year. It also has access to many millions of books in other libraries
and is the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain and between
Britain and countries overseas. The Science Reference and Information Service
is Western Europe’s most comprehensive collection of material on modern
science and technology and holds patent specifications. It provides a referral
service for company, product and market information. The Library’s Biblio¬
graphic Services division processes the material deposited with the Library for
inclusion in its catalogues, and publishes the British National Bibliography
(which lists all new books and new editions published in Britain) and other
bibliographic records. It also provides automated information services for
bibliographic data for libraries and their users. The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for research and development in library
and information services.
A new building at St Pancras, to be occupied from 1991, will eventually house
in one unit most of the Library’s London-based operations.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales, the Bodleian Library of
Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library can claim copies of all
new British publications under copyright legislation.
Some of the national museums and government departments have important
libraries. The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of
law and of most government departments, as well as famous historical
documents. The Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh serves the same purpose.
Besides a number of great private collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the learned societies and institutions.
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the British
Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of Music, the National Library for the
Blind and the National Book League.

Books
The university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of the
colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 9 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some 3-4
million volumes, Edinburgh some 2 million, Leeds some 1-8 million, and
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1 million
volumes. Many universities have important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham and the
British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of
Economics.
Many associations and commercial and industrial organisations operate library
and information services. Although most of these are primarily intended for use
within the organisation, many special libraries can be used, by arrangement, by
people interested in the area covered, and the specialist publications held are
often available for inter-library lending.
Local library authorities have a duty to provide a free lending and reference
library service in their areas, and Britain’s network of libraries has a total stock
of some 137 million books. About one-third of the total population are members
of public libraries. Some areas are served by mobile libraries, and domiciliary
services cater for people unable to visit a library. Many libraries have collections
of records, audio- and video-cassettes, and musical scores for loan to the public,
while a number also lend from collections of works of art, which may be originals
or reproductions. Most libraries hold documents on local history, and nearly all
provide children’s departments, while reference and information sections and
art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields. The information role is one of increasing
importance for many libraries, and they are making greater use of information
technology including microcomputers and reference databases.
The Government is advised on library and information matters by four Library
and Information Services Councils or Committees, representing England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively.
In 1986 British publishers issued almost 58,000 separate titles. Of these about
44,000 were new titles and the remainder reprints and new editions. The British
publishing industry devotes much effort to the development of overseas
markets, and exports of British books in 1986 amounted to over £474 million.
The industry is also distinguished for its interest in new technological
developments, including electronic publishing and the development of software
for educational and other purposes.
Among the leading organisations representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association, which has 400 members, and the
Booksellers’ Association. The Publishers Association, through its associated
body the Book Development Council, has been active in promoting the export of
British books world-wide.
The British Council publicises British books overseas through its 120
libraries in over 60 countries, participation in international book fairs and a
programme of travelling exhibitions. The Council also publishes a monthly
periodical, British Book News.
The Book Trust, whose membership includes authors, publishers, booksel¬
lers, librarians and readers, encourages an interest in books and* arranges
exhibitions throughout Britain.
The Press
Newspaper
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per person in Britain
than in most other developed countries. On an average day two out of three
people over the age of 15 read a national morning newspaper: about three out of
four read a Sunday newspaper. Three out of four adults regularly read a paid-for
regional or local newspaper. National papers have a total circulation of 14-8
million on weekdays and 17-5 million on Sundays though the total readership is
considerably greater. There are about 200 daily (Monday to Saturday) and
Sunday newspapers, 1,300 weekly newspapers (including business, sporting
and religious newspapers) and some 7,500 periodical publications.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. There is no state control or censorship of the press, but it is subject
to the general laws on publication (see p 421). Newspapers are almost always
financially independent of any political party; where they express pronounced
views and have obvious political leanings, these derive from traditional,
proprietorial and other non-party influences. In order to preserve their character
and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are governed by various
trustee-type arrangements. Others have management arrangements to ensure
their editors’ authority and independence.
In discussions on a ‘new world information and communication order’ Britain
has opposed measures designed to increase governmental regulation of the
media or to limit the free flow of information. At the same time, it has reaffirmed
its willingness to support efforts to improve communications systems in the
developing world.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and
magazine sales (but not advertising receipts) are zero-rated for value added tax.
Newspapers registered with the Post Office receive a concession on postal rates,
and there are concessions on ‘per-word’ rates for international press telegrams
and photo-telegrams. Like all postal customers, publishers can obtain reduc¬
tions in charges for regular bulk postings.
Much greater reliance is now placed on computer-based technology (see p 417)
by the national press (the regional press has been using it extensively for some
time) and working practices are undergoing profound changes throughout the
newspaper industry in response to the challenges posed by the new technology
and the need to reduce costs. Using computerised technology sharply reduces
the initial capital outlay required to produce new papers: in 1986 two new
national newspapers were launched, in February 1987 a London evening paper
was relaunched and in April 1987 a new national Sunday appeared.
Newsprint, about two-thirds of which is imported, forms roughly 20 per cent
of average national newspaper costs; labour represents about 55 per cent but
this proportion is likely to fall with the growing use of new technology. Revenue
from sales accounts for varying proportions of income; many newspapers and
periodicals derive considerable earnings from their advertising.
Ownership of the national, London and regional daily newspapers is concen¬
trated in the hands of a number of large press publishing groups (the groups
414
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
controlling the national press are listed in Table 50). There are, in addition,
some 200 independent regional and local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with interests ranging over the
whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in indepen¬
dent television and radio companies while others are involved in industrial and
commercial activities.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in independent television or independent local radio companies
have led or are leading to results contrary to the public interest, the Independent

Broadcasting Authority can, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the
companies that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There are
additional controls over newspaper interests in cable television services. In
addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting, with
that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies without the
written consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Except in

referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received its

Twelve morning daily papers and nine papers published on Sunday (see Table
50) circulate throughout most parts of Britain, and are known as national
newspapers. Traditionally, they have been produced in or near Fleet Street in
London with, in some cases, northern editions being printed in Manchester.
Recently, a majority of the national papers have moved, or made plans to move,
their editorial and printing facilities to other parts of London (including the
Docklands) or away from the capital altogether. Today, a new national
newspaper launched in 1986, is printed at Poyle (Middlesex), Manchester and
Birmingham. The new national daily ‘quality’ paper. The Independent, which
also began publishing in 1986, uses printing presses in Bradford, Peterborough
and Portsmouth.
Several newspapers have had very long and distinguished histories: for
example. The Observer, first published in 1791, is the oldest national Sunday
newspaper in the world, and The Times, one of the most influential of all
newspapers and Britain’s oldest daily national newspaper, celebrated its
two-hundredth anniversary in 1985.
The leading Scottish papers. The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland.
National newspapers are often thought of as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’ papers
on the basis of differences in style, content and format (broadsheet or tabloid,
though this is not a rigid distinction). Five dailies and three Sundays are usually
described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities and three of the
Sunday populars produce colour supplements as part of the paper.
The total circulation of national newspapers amounted to 32 million in 1986
(compared with 36 million in 1973). This figure conceals the fact that the
circulation of some newspapers has remained generally steady, while that of
others has increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, over 70 morning or
evening dailies and Sundays and some 550 newspapers appearing once or twice
a week) provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give
coverage of national and international affairs. Generally, regional evening
newspapers are non-political, while the morning newspapers adopt a more
positive political stance and tend to be independent or conservative in outlook.
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the Eastern Daily Press
(Norwich) have circulations of 93,000 and 92,000 respectively, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the
Sunday Mercu/y (Birmingham)—sell 122,000 and 169,000 copies, respectively.
Circulation figures of evening papers start at about 11,000 and most are in the
20,000 to 100,000 range: those with much larger sales include the Manchester
Evening News (301,000) and the Birmingham Evening Mail (288,000), Wolver¬
hampton’s Express and Star (244,000) and the Liverpool Echo (212,000).
Weekly papers are of mainly local appeal and are also a valuable medium for local
advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000 to 30,000 range.

There are currently two London evening newspapers, the London Standard
(with a circulation of some 522,000) and the relaunched Evening News. A
number of evening newspapers are published in the outer metropolitan area.
The hundred or so local weeklies include papers for every district in Greater
London, often in the form of local editions of an individual paper.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff;
its circulation of 81,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north Wales the Daily Post,
published in Liverpool, gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers
published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales Argus,
Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening Leader,
Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 28,000 and 103,000. North Wales
is also served by the Liverpool Echo, while the Shropshire Star covers parts
of north and mid-Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller extent by the
Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (some 66 publications) includes English-language papers,
some of which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers and Welsh-language
papers. Welsh community newspapers receive an annual grant as part of the
Government's wider financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 98,000 and 764,000, are The
Scotsman, published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald-, the Daily Record (sister
paper of the Daily Mirror); the Dundee Courier and Advertiser; the Aberdeen
Press and Journal; and the Scottish Daily Express (printed in Manchester). The
evening papers have circulations in the range of 12,000 to 185,000 and are the
Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the
Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post
and the Scottish Sunday Express (printed in Manchester).
Weekly and local newspapers number 111, and there are 31 free weekly
newspapers.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening and one Sunday
paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 42,000 to
149,000. They are the News Letter (unionist) and the Irish News (nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News. There are 42 weeklies.
Newspapers from the Irish Republic, as well as the British national press, are
widely read in Northern Ireland.
Some 80 newspapers and magazines are produced by members of the ethnic
minorities, 40 of which are printed in Asian languages and the rest mainly in
English. Most are published weekly or monthly. They include the Asian
newspapers New Life and Asian Times, The Weekly Gleaner—a local edition of
the Jamaican Gleaner—and West Indian Digest. The Voice and Caribbean Times
are aimed at the black population in general as is the magazine Root; Chic is a
fashion and beauty magazine. An Arabic daily, Al-Arab, is also produced in
Britain.
Some 900 free distribution newspapers (mostly weekly and financed by
advertising) are now published in Britain, many of which are produced by
established newspaper publishers. They have enjoyed rapid growth in recent
years and now have an estimated total weekly circulation of over 40 million.
Europe’s first daily free distribution paper, the Daily News, was launched in
Birmingham in 1984.

Technology
The 8,000 periodical publications are classified as ‘consumer general’, ‘special¬
ised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or public
services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients and some 300 free
consumer magazines. Directories and similar publications number more than
2,000. The ‘alternative’ press comprises several hundred further titles, most of
them devoted to radical politics, community matters, religion, the occult,
science or ecology.
Consumer general and specialised periodicals include magazines for a wide
range of interests: women’s magazines; publications for children; religious
periodicals; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, motoring, garden¬
ing, pop music, hobbies and humour; computer magazines; and the publica¬
tions of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and other
organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV Times
Magazine, which carry details of the week’s television and radio programmes on
BBC and independent television, respectively, each of which has a circulation of
about 3 million, and Woman's Weekly, Woman's Own, Woman, Weekly News
(which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly, with circulations in the 600,000
to 1-3 million range. Woman's Realm and the more recently launched Chat have
circulations of 625,000 and 584,000 respectively. Of monthly magazines
Reader's Digest has the highest circulation (1 -6 million). The leading journals of
opinion are The Economist, a politically independent publication covering a
wider range of topics than its title implies; the New Statesman, which reviews
politics, literature and the arts from an independent socialist point of view; the
Spectator, which covers much the same subjects from an independent
conservative standpoint; Tribune, which represents certain left-wing views
within the Labour Party; New Society, covering the sociological aspects of
current affairs; and New Scientist, which reports on science and technology in
terms which the non-specialist can understand. Articles and features relating
largely to BBC television and radio programmes appear in The Listener. Punch,
traditionally the leading humorous periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical
fortnightly, also cover public affairs. Financial Weekly and Investors Chronicle
are two of a number of periodicals for people with business and investment
interests.
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines including Time Out and City Limits provide details
of cultural and other events in London and other large cities.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, generally appeal to the
more serious reader.
Trade, technical, business, scientific and professional journals, publication of
which ranges from twice weekly to quarterly, are an important aspect of British
publishing and business communication, many having a considerable circula¬
tion overseas. There are about 500 publications of significant size covering
business and industrial affairs.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales there
are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both Welsh and
English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals, a weekly
paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals and numerous
popular magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly
publications covering business, professional and leisure interests.
The heavy production costs of newspapers and periodicals continue to
encourage publishers to look for ways of reducing these costs, often by using
computer systems to control editing and production processes. The ‘front end’
418
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or ‘single stroking’ system, for example, allows journalists or advertisement staff
to input ‘copy’ directly into a video terminal, and then by pressing a button to
transform it automatically into computer-set columns of type. Although it is
possible for these columns to be assembled electronically on a page-sized screen,
turned into a full page, and made automatically into a plate ready for transfer to
the printing press, at present very few such systems are in operation. Most
involve the production of bromides from the computer setting which are pasted
up into columns before being placed in a plate-making machine. The most
advanced systems present opportunities for reorganisation which have implica¬
tions throughout a newspaper office and may give rise to disputes over manning
levels and other industrial relations problems. Generally, and most recently in
the case of national newspapers, the introduction of computerised systems has
led to substantial reductions in workforces, particularly, but not solely, among
print workers.
Most of the national newspapers now use some computer technology, while its
use in the provincial press, which has generally led the way in adopting new
techniques, is widespread. The national newspapers Today and The Indepen¬
dent are produced by fully computerised systems: journalists type articles
directly into and edit them on computer terminals, while colour pictures and
graphics are entered into the same system electronically. News International,
publisher of three daily and two Sunday papers, uses at its new east London
headquarters more than 500 computer terminals, one of the largest systems
ever installed at one time anywhere in the world. Many other national papers are
also building new computer-based printing plants outside Fleet Street. Where
printing plants are some distance from editorial offices, pages for printing are
sent by facsimile machine from typesetter to print plant.
Other technological developments include the introduction of full-colour
printing, and a switch from traditional letterpress printing to the web-offset
litho process.
News Agencies The four principal news agencies in Britain are: Reuters, an international news
organisation registered in London, The Press Association, The Exchange
Telegraph Company and Extel Financial.
Reuters is a publicly owned company, employing some 6,850 full-time staff in
80 countries. Of its 1,040 journalists, 730 work outside the United Kingdom.
The company’s world-wide communications network makes use of satellites,
cables and microwave radio, and is connected to computerised message¬
handling systems and data banks located around the world. Services include
general news for the media delivered by teleprinter or fed directly into clients’
computers, and specialised economic news and information services for
business delivered through video terminals, by teleprinter or by direct computer
feed. Reuters serves subscribers in 158 countries including financial institu¬
tions, commodities houses, traders in currencies, equities and bonds, news¬
papers, radio and television stations, and news agencies.
In 1985 Reuters launched its own world service of news pictures, having in the
previous year acquired the news pictures business outside the United States of
United Press International, the American news agency.
The Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency, is co-operatively
owned by the principal daily newspapers of the United Kingdom outside London,
and of the Irish Republic. It provides to national and regional newspapers
and broadcasting services a complete service of home news, including general
and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all types of financial, commercial and
sports news, and includes in its services to regional papers the world news of
Reuters and Associated Press. News is teleprinted from London, certain items
being available in teletypesetting form. Its ‘Newsfile’ service provides general

home news on screen to non-media as well as media clients by means of
telephone and viewdata terminals. Also available on screen is the ‘Esmerk’
service, an international digest of business information. The photographic
department provides newspapers and broadcasters with a daily service of
pictures from Britain and overseas; these are wired to the regional press. The
NewsFeatures service supplies reports of local or special interest and provides
exclusive rights to syndicated articles and visual features.
The Exchange Telegraph Company is the chief supplier of sports information
throughout Britain, providing results and comment to every national news¬
paper, television and radio, as well as overseas news agencies and the CEEFAX
and ORACLE teletext services. The Racing News Service is supplied to all betting
shops in Britain and the Irish Republic and provides a full news and information
service about race meetings, including running commentaries from many
meetings. This information is transmitted by Extelnet through six centres in
Britain by high-speed digital circuits provided by British Telecom and managed
by Extel Communications. Changes in legislation controlling licensed betting
offices have encouraged the development of more advanced technology to supply
closed-circuit video to betting shops and other subscribers.
Extel Financial supplies information and services to British and international
financial institutions. Based in London, it has a network of offices in Europe
and the United States and representatives in Japan and South-east Asia. Data
are collected from all the world’s money exchanges, from companies and from
the international press. The agency is a major source of reference material on
companies and finance; it provides a comprehensive range of data products on
international financial matters; and provides specialised services by computer
to banks, insurance companies and other institutions.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Associ¬
ated Press Ltd and United Press International, which are British subsidiaries of
United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which represents
the principal regional press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of further education or direct
recruitment by a regional or local newspaper. Both categories of entrant take
part in an apprenticeship scheme consisting of ‘on-the-job’ training, and
block-release courses are provided for those who have not attended a pre-entry
course. There are similar courses for press photographers. Postgraduate
diploma courses in journalism are provided at University College, Cardiff, and
the City University (London). Courses are provided by the Newspaper Society
Training Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as newspaper sales,
advertising, industrial relations and management.
Specialist training courses for senior journalists from developing countries
are run by the Thomson Foundation in London. The Foundation also conducts
training courses in developing countries and provides consultants to assist
newspapers and magazines in such areas as advertising, management, circula¬
tion and the introduction and operation of new technology. It runs an
international training centre in collaboration with Xinhua News Agency in
Peking.

The Periodicals Training Council is the official training organisation in
periodical publishing. It offers a wide range of short courses covering editorial
work, advertisement sales and circulation sales. It has special responsibility for
editorial training and administers an industry-wide editorial training scheme
for those already in employment. The postgraduate courses in journalism at
Cardiff and the City University offer periodical journalism options, and the
London College of Printing provides postgraduate courses and General Certifi¬
cate of Education Advanced-level courses in periodical journalism. Reed
Business Publishing Ltd, one of the largest publishing companies, runs an
in-company training course for suitable candidates from the general public on a
fee-paying basis.
Under the Harry Brittain Memorial Fellowship Scheme, administered by
the Commonwealth Press Union, several young Commonwealth journalists
each year spend three months working and studying in Britain, while the
Reuter Foundation, established in 1982, awards six fellowships each year to
journalists from developing countries to study at Oxford, Stanford and
Bordeaux universities. In 1987 the Reuter Foundation established a fellowship
for photo-journalists from developing countries at the School of Journalism,
University of Missouri.
Annual Student Media Awards are presented jointly by The Guardian
newspaper and the National Union of Students to students in higher education
who have excelled in college press, television and radio journalism.
The most important employers' organisations are the Newspaper Publishers
Association, whose members publish national newspapers in London and
Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional, local and
London suburban press; the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, which represents the owners of weekly
newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers, whose
members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland; and the
Periodical Publishers Association, whose membership embraces the majority of
independent publishers of business, professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are the National Union of Journalists,
with some 32,500 members, and the Institute of Journalists, with about 2,500
members. Two main printing unions are concerned with the press: the Society
of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT) '82, with nearly 200,000 members, and
the National Graphical Association 1982, with 132,000 members, about
one-sixth of whom work on newspapers.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors is the officially recognised profes¬
sional body for newspaper editors. It has approximately 450 members and aims
to maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong. The Association of British Editors,
representing the whole range of media including radio, television, newspapers
and magazines, was established in 1984.
The main aim of the Foreign Press Association, founded in 1888, is to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings and a range of other facilities.
The Press Council is a voluntary and non-statutory body founded by the
newspaper industry in 1953 on the recommendation of the first Royal
Commission on the press to safeguard the freedom of the press and to ensure
that it conducts itself responsibly. It comprises equal numbers of press and

421

non-press members, including members of the public, with an independent
chairman. Its full aims are to preserve the established freedom of the press;
maintain the character of the press in accordance with the highest professional
and commercial standards; keep under review any developments likely to
restrict the supply of information of public interest and importance; deal with
complaints about the conduct of the press or the conduct of individuals and
organisations towards the press; report on developments in the press which may
tend towards greater concentration or monopoly; make representations on
appropriate occasions to the Government, the United Nations and press
organisations abroad; publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording
its work; and review from time to time developments in the press and the factors
affecting them.
Dealing with complaints from the public about the content and conduct of the
press is the Council’s best-known function. It has no power to impose penalties
on publications which it has found guilty of malpractice, but relies on the
sanction of adverse publicity. It can censure newspapers, magazines, editors
and journalists, and issues adjudications which the editor of the newspaper or
magazine criticised by the Council has a moral obligation to publish in full. The
Council sometimes initiates inquiries into aspects of press conduct without first
receiving public complaints. Its annual reports include press statistics and
articles on the structure of leading press groups.
Advertising practice in the press (and in the cinema and on posters) is regulated
and controlled by the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
which aims to promote and enforce the highest standards of advertising in the
interests of the public and the industry, in particular through the British Code
of Advertising Practice. The objects of the code are to ensure that advertisements
are legal, decent, honest and truthful; that they are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer; that they conform to the principles of fair
competition as generally accepted in business; and that no advertisement brings
advertising into disrepute or reduces confidence in advertising as a service to
industry and the public.
The Authority’s main activities are monitoring advertisements for their
compliance with the code; initiating modifications to the code; and dealing with
complaints received direct from members of the public. Its main sanction is the
recommendation to media that advertisements considered to be in breach of the
code should not be published. It also publishes regular reports on the results of
its investigations, naming the companies involved.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest. There are no specific press laws, but certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press. There is a legal requirement to
reproduce ‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer's name and place of publication) on
all publications, including newspapers. In addition, certain formalities exist
relating to the depositing of copies of newspapers and other publications at the
British Library and the making of annual returns to Companies House in the
rare circumstances in which a newspaper is not printed and published as a joint
stock company. Other provisions relate to such matters as the extent of
newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the transfer of
newspaper assets; restrictions on the reporting of certain types of court
proceedings and on publishing material likely to stir up racial hatred; the right
of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities;
restrictions on the publication of advertisement and investment circulars
(which are governed by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading
descriptions of goods and services and with fraud) and of advertisements for
422
BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
remedies for certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation;
agreements between British Telecom and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic
communications, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions
on certain types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under
copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are laws such as those on contempt of
court, official secrets, libel and defamation. A newspaper may not publish
comments on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice
the courts’ reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings, nor
may it publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and publication of information of a
confidential or security nature from state and official sources is an offence under
the Official Secrets Act 1911. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for
seditious libel and incitement to disaffection. The majority of legal proceedings
against the press are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases,
the editor, proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as
well as the author, may all be held responsible.
Government officials and representatives of the media who form the Defence,
Press and Broadcasting Committee have agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of information might endanger national
security. Details of these categories are contained in Defence Notices (D Notices)
circulated to the media who are asked to seek advice from the Secretary of the
Committee, a senior civil servant, before publishing information in these areas.
Compliance with any advice offered by the Secretary is expected but there is no
legal force behind it and the final decision on whether to publish lies with the
editor, producer or publisher concerned.
23 Television
and Radio
Broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service accountable to
the people through Parliament. Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—provide
television and radio services throughout the country. In Wales the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority is responsible for programmes on one channel. The
authorities work to broad requirements and objectives defined by Parliament,
but are otherwise independent in the day-to-day conduct of business.
This independence carries with it certain obligations over programmes and
programme content. Programmes must display, as far as possible, a proper
balance and wide range of subject matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not offend against good taste. Codes of
guidance on violence in television programmes, particularly during hours when
large numbers of children are likely to be viewing, are operated by both
authorities. A code of advertising standards and practice is also operated by the
IBA. (The BBC does not broadcast advertisements.) A complaints commission
deals with allegations of unfair treatment or infringement of privacy in
programmes. Publicly available video recordings are classified according to their
suitability for different audiences.
The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally, is answerable to
Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a number of
technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain: about
95 per cent of the population watch television, average viewing time per person
being about 27 hours a week. Over 50 per cent of households have two or more
receivers. The growth in use of video-cassette recorders and equipment
(including home computers) for playing television games has for many people
increased the choice of entertainment available in the home. (Over 50 per cent of
households rent or own a video-cassette recorder.) Practically every home also
has a radio set, and car radios and portable sets have made radio a major
daytime diversion.
Households with television must buy an annual licence costing £18 for black
and white or £58 for colour. Over 18-9 million licences were current in March
1987, about 16-5 million for colour.
The British The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by Royal Charter and by
Broadcasting a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation of 12 governors including the
Corporation Chairman (each appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Government and
including separate governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) is finally
responsible for all aspects of broadcasting. Committees advise them on a wide
range of matters including the social effects of television, religious broadcasting,
music, agriculture, schools broadcasting, further education, programmes for
ethnic minorities, science and engineering, and charitable appeals. The
governors appoint the Director-General, the Corporation’s chief executive
officer, who heads the BBC’s board of management, which is in charge of the
daily operation of the services.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

BRITAIN 1988: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Companies
control the policy and content of television and radio programmes intended
primarily for reception in their areas. Local radio councils, representative of the
local community, advise on the development and operation of the BBC’s local
radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally from the sale of
television licences. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including television programme exports, sale of recordings and publications
connected with BBC programmes, hire and sale of educational films, film library
sales, and exhibitions based on programmes. Nearly three-quarters of expendi¬
ture on domestic services relates to television. The BBC meets the cost of its local
radio stations while some local education authorities help to make educational
programmes.
The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office.
Recommendations on the financing of the BBC’s domestic services were made
by a government-appointed committee under the chairmanship of Sir (then
Professor) Alan Peacock whose report was published in 1986. The report made
proposals for radical changes in the structure of broadcasting. Its central
recommendation was that British broadcasting should move towards a sophisti¬
cated market system based on freedom of consumer choice with viewers and
listeners having the option of purchasing broadcasting services from as many
alternative sources of supply as possible. Public finance would, however,
continue to be needed for programmes of a public service nature. The report
rejected the idea that the BBC should at present be funded by advertising, and
this has been accepted by the Government.
The IBA's constitution and finances are governed by statute. Its 12 members
(three of whom have responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) are
appointed by the Home Secretary. The IBA does not produce radio or television
programmes; these are provided by independent programme companies on a
regional basis and by the Channel Four Television Company (a wholly owned
subsidiary of the IBA). The ISA’s main functions are to appoint the companies,
supervise programme arrangements, control advertising, and build, own and
operate transmitting stations. Its chief executive officer, the Director-General, is
supported by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and
administrative services.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist panel
advises on advertisements of a medical nature. Local committees advise on local
radio services.
The IBA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the television
and radio programme companies for the use of its transmitters. The television
programme companies are also liable to pay to the IBA, for transfer to
government funds, a levy related to their profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide programmes
in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share the contract for
London, one providing programmes during the week and the other at the
weekend). A contract to provide a national early morning television service,
transmitted on the ITV network, is held by an additional company. The
companies operate on a commercial basis, deriving most of their revenue from
the sale of advertising time. The financial resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies vary considerably, depending largely
on the size of population in the areas in which they operate. Although
TELEVISION AND RADIO
425
Television
newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies, there are
safeguards to protect the public interest.
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These are produced by the company
itself and by other programme companies or bought from elsewhere. There are
controls on the number of television programmes which may be bought from
abroad. The five largest companies, serving London, north-west England, East
Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire, provide more programmes for broad¬
cast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones. A common
news service is provided by Independent Television News Ltd, a non-profit-
making company in which all the programme companies are shareholders.
Negotiations for the supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and their
co-ordinated transmission through the independent television network take
place largely on the Network Programme Committee, which consists of
representatives of all the programme companies and of the IBA.
Similar principles apply to independent local radio. The programme com¬
panies are under contract to the IBA, operate under its control and are financed
by advertising revenue. News coverage is supplied as a common service by
Independent Radio News.
Four television channels are in operation. BBC 1 and BBC 2 are owned by the
BBC; ITV (Independent Television) is controlled by, and Channel 4 is owned by,
the IBA; all four channels broadcast on 625 lines ultra-high frequency (uhf).
About 99 per cent of the population live within range of transmission.
Apart from a break during the second world war the BBC has been providing
regular television broadcasts since 1936. Over 100 hours of programmes are
transmitted by each of the two BBC channels every week; all BBC 2 programmes
and the vast majority of those on BBC 1 are broadcast on the national network.
Approximately 70 per cent of the BBC’s home-produced network programmes
for 1986—87 were produced in London and 30 per cent elsewhere in Britain. It is
the aim of the Government that at least 25 per cent of programmes on all
channels should be made by independent producers.
Through co-ordinated planning on its two services the BBC caters simul¬
taneously for people of different interests. While both services cover the whole
range of television output, BBC 1 presents more programmes of general interest,
such as light entertainment, sport, current affairs, children’s programmes and
outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places greater emphasis on minority interests,
but also provides documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music,
programmes on pastimes and international films. The daytime schedule
contains an early morning television service on BBC 1 from Monday to Friday,
providing news, information and light entertainment.
The first regular ITV programmes began in London in 1955. On average each
of the 14 ITV areas transmitted over 100 hours of television programmes a week
in 1986—87, nearly two-fifths of them comprising informative programmes—
including news, documentaries, and programmes on current affairs, education
and religion. Almost three-quarters of the programmes are produced by the
programme companies. A national early morning television service on ITV
provides about three hours of news, information, current affairs and light
entertainment daily.
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in 1982, provides a national television
service throughout Britain, except in Wales which has a corresponding service
(Sianel 4 Cymru—S4C—see below). The IBA must ensure that programmes on
Channel 4 are complementary to those of ITV, catering for tastes and interests
not normally provided for by the original independent service. It must provide a
suitable proportion (about 15 per cent) of educational programmes, encourage
426

innovation and experiment, and include a substantial proportion of pro¬
grammes from independent producers. Channel 4 broadcasts for approximately
75 hours a week, about half of which is devoted to informative programmes. The
service, both nationally and in Wales, is financed by subscriptions from the
programme companies in return for advertising time in fourth channel
programmes broadcast in their own regions. In Wales, programmes on the
fourth channel are run and controlled by the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority
appointed by the Home Secretary. The Authority is required to ensure that a
substantial proportion (in practice some 23 hours a week) are in Welsh and that
those broadcast between 18.30 and 22.00 hours are mainly in Welsh. At other
times the Welsh fourth channel shows national Channel 4 programmes.
Britain is one of the world’s foremost exporters of television productions,
exporting in 1986 programmes worth roughly £60 million. In 1986 British
productions won a number of international awards, including first prizes in
three of the five programme categories and a special award in the International
Emmy Awards in the United States.
A service to cable operators on the continent of Europe is provided by
Superchannel, a satellite-relayed television channel owned and operated by most
of the independent television companies, which transmits a schedule of
programmes selected from ITV and the BBC and acquired series and films.
Until recently, a small proportion of households with television sets have
received their television services by cable. The vast majority of cable systems
have been used solely to relay broadcast television and radio services in order to
improve reception quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local
topography, or because external aerials are not allowed on some residential
buildings.
Legislation has been passed to allow a much more general expansion of cable
television. It is intended that cable investment should be privately financed (the
Government is, however, providing £5 million to the cable television industry to
encourage the development of advanced interactive services such as home
banking and shopping over broadband cable systems); that regulation should be
as light as possible to allow the development of a wide range of services and
facilities, and flexible enough to adapt to changing technology; and that there
should be certain safeguards for existing broadcasting services. A new national
Cable Authority has been established to issue licences, supervise programme
services and promote cable development. In 1983, licences were awarded to 11
cable systems to serve as pilot projects, and some existing cable operators,
formerly relaying broadcast services, have been licensed to offer additional
services on their existing systems. By January 1987 the Cable Authority had
awarded a further 11 cable franchises.
In July 1987 over 1-25 million homes were capable of receiving non-broadcast
cable services. The number of homes receiving such services was 208,000. Cable
operators are represented by the Cable Television Association.
BBC Radio has four national channels. Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop music,
while Radio 2 provides music and light entertainment as well as being the
principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 broadcasts mainly classical
music as well as drama, poetry and short stories, talks and documentaries, and
Test Match cricket (on medium wave only). Radio 4 is the main speech network,
providing the principal news and current affairs service, as well as drama,
comedy, documentaries and panel games; it also carries parliamentary coverage
and live relays of major public events. At present, there is no independent
national radio service, but legislation passed in 1984 gave the IBA power to build
a transmitter network for such a service.

Services
There are 32 BBC local radio stations serving England and the Channel
Islands, and regional and community radio services in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, as well as 47 ILR (independent local radio) contractors
throughout Britain. Further BBC and ILR stations are planned. About 90 per
cent of the population is served by BBC or ILR stations. Broadcasts provide a
comprehensive service of local news and information, music and other
entertainment, education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and
offer listeners a chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
Some 200 hospitals and 20 universities have closed-circuit radio stations.
In a Green Paper published in February 1987, the Government outlined its
proposals for the long-term future of radio broadcasting. The BBC would
continue to broadcast nationally programmes of a public service nature, that is,
high-quality and wide-ranging programmes that inform, educate and entertain,
but additional national radio services run on commercial lines would be
introduced to provide greater choice and also competition. A new tier of
independent community or special interest local stations would be established.
Both the BBC and the IBA broadcast educational programmes for children and
students in schools of all kinds, as well as for pre-school children, and for adults
in colleges and other institutions and in their homes. Broadcasts to schools
cover most subjects of the curriculum, while education programmes for adults
cover many fields of learning, vocational training and recreation. Supporting
material in the form of books, pamphlets, filmstrips, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes, is available to supplement the programmes. The BBC
broadcasts television and radio programmes made specially for students of the
Open University, most of whose 130 or so undergraduate courses contain video
and audio components, some of them available on cassette for use with
correspondence texts. The BBC Open University Centre also produces educa¬
tional and training audio-visual materials in collaboration with external
agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of
Education and Science and the Engineering Industry Training Board. The Open
College, a new initiative in vocational training, is due to start in September 1987
with the transmission of courses on Channel 4 ranging from basic literacy and
numeracy to high-level technological studies.
The BBC External Services broadcast by radio world-wide, using English and 36
other languages, for nearly 735 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, reflect British opinion and project British life, culture and
developments in science and industry. News bulletins, current affairs pro¬
grammes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes form the
main part of the output, with a full sports service, music, drama and general
entertainment. Regular listeners were estimated to number more than 120
million in 1986.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of time
each is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from this the BBC
has full responsibility and is completely independent in determining the content
of news and other programmes. A plan to improve audibility is in progress.
The BBC World Service broadcasts by radio for 24 hours a day in English and
is supplemented at peak listening times by programmes of special interest to
Africa, South Asia and the Falkland Islands. Plans to broadcast a televised
service are being considered by the BBC.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are re-broadcast by the radio
services of many countries. Re-broadcasting involves direct relays from BBC
transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the BBC
Transcription Service. There are some 3,000 re-broadcasts weekly of World
428

Broadcasting
Service programmes in about 150 countries. The Transcription Service offers
programmes to over 100 countries.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast daily
by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and recorded lessons are
supplied to some 300 stations free of charge. English by Television programmes
are also shown in more than 100 countries. There is a wide range of printed and
audio material accompanying these programmes.
Another part of the External Services, the Monitoring Service, listens to and
reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news and
comment from overseas to the BBC and the Government. This information is
also sold to the press, to companies, to academic staff and public bodies.
Radio for overseas is also produced by the radio services of the Central Office of
Information (COI). A wide range of recorded material is sent to radio stations in
about 100 countries. COI television services provide material such as
documentary and magazine programmes for distribution to overseas stations.
The BBC does not give publicity to any firm or organised interest except when it
is necessary to provide effective and informative programmes. It must not
broadcast any commercial advertisement or any sponsored programme.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but advertisers can
have no influence on programme content or editorial control. Advertisements
must be clearly distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the time
given to them must not be so great as to detract from the value of the
programmes as a medium of information, education or entertainment. Advertis¬
ing is normally limited to seven minutes in any one hour of broadcasting time,
and averaged over the day’s programmes must not exceed six minutes per hour.
The independent local radio stations are normally limited to a maximum of nine
minutes of advertising each hour. The IBA has a code governing standards and
practice in advertising on television and radio and giving guidance on the types
and methods of advertisement which are prohibited; this includes advertising
with a political or religious object or on behalf of cigarettes or betting.
Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programme, such as
broadcasts to schools. A comparable code has been adopted by the Cable
Authority, which is responsible for advertising control and policy on cable
television. The IBA has endorsed the Principles for Advertising by Direct Satellite
Broadcasting which have been drawn up by the European Broadcasting Union.
The Government has no general privileged access to radio or television but
government publicity material to support non-political campaigns may be
broadcast on independent radio and television. This is prepared through the
COI and broadcast and paid for bn a normal commercial basis. Short public
service items, concerning health, safety and welfare, are also produced by the
COI for free transmission by the BBC and independent television and radio.
Parliamentary reporting includes a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament. Proceedings, including those of committees, are
broadcast on radio, some live and others in recorded form in radio and television
news and current affairs programmes. The House of Commons is not televised.
The issue has arisen on a number of occasions, with members voting against it,
most recently in 1985. An experiment in televising the House of Lords began in
1985; members decided in 1986 that it should continue on a permanent basis.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are transmitted periodically on radio
and television, under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC
and the IBA, and there are special arrangements for the period following the
announcement of a general election.
TELEVISION AND RADIO
429
Audience
Research
Technical
Developments
Both the BBC and the IBA are required to keep themselves informed on the state
of public opinion about the programmes (and, in the case of the IBA, the
advertising) they broadcast. This is done through the continuous measurement
of the size and composition of audiences and their opinions of programmes. For
television, this work is undertaken through the Broadcasters’ Audience
Research Board, which is owned jointly by the BBC and the IBA. Information is
collected from a panel of about 3,000 homes throughout the country designed to
be representative of all private households in Britain with a television set. Meters
attached to each television set and linked to a central computer are used to
record times of viewing, numbers of viewers and programmes watched. Regular
surveys and questionnaires are conducted by both the BBC and the IBA to gauge
audience opinion on television and radio services, and public opinion is further
assessed by both bodies through the work of their many advisory committees,
councils and panels (whose members are drawn from a wide cross-section of the
public); the regular holding of public meetings to debate the services provided;
and careful consideration of correspondence and telephone calls from listeners
and viewers.
One of the most important recent developments has been the introduction of
smaller, lighter cameras and video recorders for use on location. Electronic
news-gathering equipment, whereby pictures can be transmitted directly to a
studio or recorded on video tape on location, reduces significantly the time
before an item can be broadcast. Other developments include the use of new
types of video tape recorders, the increasing use of computers to generate
graphical shapes such as captions and credits, and the improvement of the
quality of video tape pictures.
Among recent developments by the BBC are the ACE digital television
standards converter, probably the most advanced in the world, which is used to
convert pictures between the European and American standards, and the
NICAM system used to carry high-quality sound programme signals across the
country. Both of these systems have been licensed to commercial manufactur¬
ers. The BBC has also developed a data-labelling system for sound programmes
which will make programme and station selection much easier. Research
includes investigations into stereo sound for television, digital transmission of
signals over fibre-optic cables, improved picture displays, and many aspects of
satellite broadcasting. IBA engineers were the first in the world to introduce a
fully digital field rate standards converter to improve the interchange of
programmes between areas using the 525-line system and those using the
625-line system. The IBA is at present engaged in the further development of
digital techniques for studio applications and inter-city links, and a study of the
future use of satellites for broadcasting which has included the development of a
new MAC/packet family of transmission systems for use on future direct
broadcast satellites and for distribution on cable networks. The European
Broadcasting Union has recommended the MAC/packet family system as the
standard for Europe, and the Government has endorsed the use of D-MAC as the
system for British direct broadcasting by satellite.
Another IBA development has been an enhanced MAC system for satellite
transmission capable of providing wide-screen pictures at a subjective definition
of about 1,000 lines, fully compatible with MAC transmissions and capable of
being transmitted in a single 27-MHz satellite channel.
It is hoped that by the end of 1989 direct broadcasting by satellite, by which
television pictures are transmitted directly from space into people’s homes, will
be available throughout Britain. The IBA has appointed a programme contractor
(British Satellite Broadcasting) for three of the five satellite channels allocated to
the United Kingdom by international agreement. It is expected that four

separate programme services devoted to news and sport, feature films,
children’s programmes and general entertainment will be set up. They will be
commercial services funded by advertising and subscription.
The BBC and IBA have co-operated in the development of a teletext system,
known by the BBC as CEEFAX and the IBA as ORACLE. The use of teletext
allows the television signal to carry additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics on receivers equipped with the
necessary decoders. The system is also used to provide programme subtitles,
which are of great benefit to the deaf and hard of hearing. Over 2 million
teletext-equipped sets are in use in Britain. More than 95 per cent of teletext sets
throughout the world are based on the British system, and working services
operating to the British standard are in use or on trial in 13 countries, including
Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. British
Telecom’s public viewdata service, ‘Prestel’, offers a wide range of information
which is transmitted via the telephone and viewed on the television screen.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union. This body
manages Eurovision, the international network of television news and pro¬
gramme exchange, and is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes and news over the
Eurovision network and intercontinental satellite links; it also maintains a
technical monitoring station where frequency measurements and other observa¬
tions on broadcasting stations are carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and national broadcasters of Western Europe
and other parts of the world and co-ordinates co-operation in radio and
television. Co-operation between governments takes place within the Council of
Europe which, in 1986, adopted a British proposal to prepare a convention on
the regulation of broadcasting across frontiers.
Visnews is the largest television news agency in the world, supplying world
newsfilm to 462 subscribers in 85 countries and running bureaux in 21 capital
cities. Worldwide Television News, owned by Independent Television News, the
American Broadcasting Company and Channel 9 in Australia, supplies services
to over 500 broadcasters in 75 countries. Both agencies supply services via the
Eurovision network and by satellite.
The BBC and the IBA are associate members of the Asian Pacific Broadcasting
Union, and the BBC also belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Associa¬
tion (CBA), whose members extend to one another such facilities as the use of
studios, recording channels and programme contributions.
The BBC provides technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other
broadcasting organisations throughout the world; members of its staff are
seconded for service overseas.
The Government finances a number of overseas students on broadcasting
training courses at the BBC, the British Council (which aims to promote a wider
knowledge of Britain and the English language abroad and to develop closer
cultural relations between Britain and other countries) and the Thomson
Foundation Television College in Glasgow, which sends lecturers and arranges
courses overseas.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Telecom¬
munications Union, the United Nations agency responsible for regulating and
controlling all international telecommunications services (including radio and
television), allocating and registering all radio frequencies and promoting and
co-ordinating the international study of technical problems in broadcasting.
The BBC and the IBA are also represented on the United Kingdom Committee of
the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
24 Sport and
Recreation
The British invented and codified the rules of many of the sports and games
which are now played all over the world, and there is widespread interest in most
kinds of sport throughout the country. Large crowds attend occasions such as
the football and rugby league challenge Cup Finals at Wembley Stadium, the
international rugby union matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff
Arms Park, the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races.
Grand Prix motor racing and the cricket Test matches. Extensive coverage on
television (2,700 hours in 1986, compared with 1,200 in 1975) has helped to
generate interest in a wide variety of sports and recreations including
basketball, darts, snooker, ice skating, skiing and athletics, while American
football and baseball are becoming known to the British public through televised
transmissions from the United States.
Levels of participation in sport have been rising due mainly to the increases in
leisure time and facilities, greater mobility and rising living standards. A
growing awareness of the importance to good health of regular exercise has been
reflected in the upsurge of interest in jogging, keep fit and dance-related forms of
exercise. It has been estimated that nearly a half of the adult population
regularly takes part in sport, men still outnumbering women. Walking is by far
the most popular recreational activity, followed by swimming, snooker and
billiards, darts, angling, athletics, football, squash, golf and cycling.
The Government has long recognised the importance of physical recreation for
the general welfare of the community; the social role that sport can play has
become more important at a time of high unemployment and rapid change in
work and leisure patterns. The ten-year strategy for the development of sport in
England drawn up by the Sports Council in 1982 is to encourage further
increases in participation, particularly among young people and those nearing
retirement; to provide adequate facilities for the whole community, especially in
the inner cities and in deprived rural areas; and to continue to encourage high
standards of performance. Similar strategies are being followed by the Sports
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The ‘Action Sport’ pro¬
gramme, supported by the Manpower Services Commission, is designed
principally to encourage young people in inner cities to take up sport and
recreation; it is intended that 1,100 sports leaders will be provided to work with
disadvantaged groups by mid-1988. The Commission has also supported
initiatives aimed at strengthening links between football clubs and their local
communities. ‘What’s Your Sport?’, a new campaign to increase participation in
sports, was launched by the Sports Councils in April 1987.
Gleneagles In accordance with the statement on apartheid in sport, agreed by the
Agreement Commonwealth heads of Government at Gleneagles in Scotland in 1977, the
Government seeks to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa and
withholds any form of support for such contacts; in a democratic society,
however, it cannot prevent these contacts if an individual sportsman or
sportswoman or the governing body of the sport concerned chooses to ignore its
advice.

ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
Sports Councils
Countryside
Commissions
Government policy on sport, active recreation and children's play is co-ordinated
in England by the Minister for Sport (a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
at the Department of the Environment). The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities in their countries.
Responsibility for the organisation and promotion of sport is largely decentral¬
ised, and most sports and recreation facilities are provided by local authorities.
The Government provides financial and other assistance through a number of
official bodies and schemes. This ‘arm s length' principle of funding safeguards
the long-established independence of sports organisations in Britain. Some of
these bodies, such as the Sports Councils and the Countryside Commissions,
have specific responsibilities for sport and/or recreation, and help other public
and private bodies to provide facilities. Others, like the Forestry Commission,
the British Waterways Board, the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional
water authorities, provide recreational amenities in addition to their main
functions.
Individual sports are run by over 370 independent governing bodies whose
functions usually include drawing up rules, holding events, regulating mem¬
bership, selecting and training national teams and promoting international
links. There are also organisations representing people who take part in more
informal physical recreation, such as walking and cycling.
A National Coaching Foundation has been established to improve the
knowledge and practice of coaching. Its work complements that of the four
Sports Councils and the governing bodies of sports.
Government assistance for the development of sport in Great Britain is
channelled through three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England
and for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for
Wales and the Scottish Sports Council. In Northern Ireland the Department of
Education makes direct grants towards the capital cost of facilities to local
authorities and voluntary sports bodies; thus the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland has limited grant-making powers. The Councils will allocate government
funds amounting to £46-7 million in 1987—88. They make grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sports
and other national organisations, and administer the national sports centres.
Grants and loans are also made to voluntary organisations and local authorities
(and, in some cases, to commercial organisations) to assist the provision of
sports facilities. In all, the Councils supported well over 3,000 projects in
1986—87. The Sports Council assists British representatives at international
sports meetings and encourages links with international and overseas organisa¬
tions. All four Councils have information centres providing data on a wide range
of sports topics. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and
representative bodies of sport and physical recreation in England; the equiva¬
lent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the Scottish and Welsh
Sports Associations and the Northern Ireland Council of Physical Recreation.
Ten regional councils for sport and recreation in England, on each of which
sporting, recreational, educational, and local authority interests are repre¬
sented, advise on investment in and the planning of sporting and recreational
facilities and the promotion of sport.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for conserving and enhancing the natural beauty and
amenity of the countryside, and encouraging the provision and improvement of
facilities for open-air recreation therein. Government support in 1987—88
amounts to £19-5 million for the Countryside Commission for England and

PROVISION OF
FACILITIES
Wales of which about £6-5 million will be spent on recreation. This will include
grant aiding the provision by local authorities and private bodies of country
parks, picnic sites and informal recreation facilities. In Northern Ireland, the
Ulster Countryside Committee advises the Department of the Environment on
the preservation of amenities and the designation of areas of outstanding
beauty.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations, and its importance as a source of funding is recognised by the
Government and the Sports Councils. The estimated value of commercial
sponsorship was some £160 million in 1986. Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to individual sports organisations or
sportsmen and sportswomen. The Sports Aid Foundation and Sports Aid Trust
raise and distribute funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in
order to assist the training of talented individuals; grants are awarded on the
recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The Scottish and Welsh
Sports Aid Foundations and the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust fulfil similar
functions. Sponsorship advisory services are also run by the Sports Councils
and the Central Council of Physical Recreation.
Successive governments have negotiated voluntary agreements with the
tobacco industry to regulate tobacco companies' sponsorship of sport, the last
one having come into force in January 1987. This should lead to a reduction in
spending by tobacco firms on sports sponsorship and introduces a ceiling on
promotional activity. It prohibits sponsorship of events designed to appeal
mainly to spectators of less than 18 years of age and the depiction of any
participants in a sport in media advertising and places strict controls on siting
of signs at televised events and on the size of health warnings on these signs.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation: their estimated expenditure on sport and recreation
amounted to some £1,000 million in Britain in 1986—87. Provision of facilities
was substantially increased in the 1970s to meet the increasing demand and to
encourage further expansion of participation. The facilities provided include
parks, lakes, playing fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, swimming
pools and sports centres catering for a wide range of activities.
Increased emphasis is being placed on the need to provide new and improved
sports facilities in areas of urban stress. A wide range of sports and recreational
projects in urban areas are supported under the Government’s urban pro¬
gramme, while the Derelict Land Grant scheme provides funding towards sports
and recreational facilities on reclaimed sites. In 1985—86 total urban pro¬
gramme and Derelict Land Grant scheme support for sports and recreational
projects amounted to just over £37 million.
Many recreational facilities are also made available by local sports clubs. Some
cater for indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports
grounds, particularly for games such as cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis
and golf. Clubs linked to business firms often cater for a wide range of activities.
Commercial facilities include tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller-skating
rinks, squash courts, golf courses and driving ranges, curling rinks, riding
stables, marinas and, increasingly, fitness centres.
Publicly maintained schools must provide for the physical education of their
pupils. All (except those solely for infants) are expected to have a playing field or
the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium. Some have other
amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance
and movement. Sports and recreation facilities are also provided at institutions
of higher and further education (some of which have departments of physical

education), and there are ‘centres of sporting excellence', often at universities
and other colleges, which enable selected young athletes to develop their talents
and which provide, where appropriate, for their educational needs.
To achieve the maximum use of sports facilities, the Government and the
Sports Councils are encouraging greater community use of sports halls and
other facilities owned by schools, colleges and other public and private sector
institutions, including football clubs.
The Education (No 2) Act 1986 contains a provision aimed at encouraging the
wider adoption of schemes allowing community use of school facilities outside
school hours.
Safety at sports grounds and stadiums is governed by legislation, but,
following the fire at Bradford City Football Ground in 1985 in which 56 people
died, and the subsequent findings of a committee of inquiry, safety standards
are being strengthened. The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 is
designed to improve provisions for the safety of spectators at sports grounds and
indoor sports premises.
Five national sports centres, four in England and one in Wales, are run by the
Sports Council, and provide a range of competition and training facilities. As
well as offering residential courses for national teams, coaches and enthusiasts
from all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local sports clubs and
the local community. Combined facilities for a range of sports are provided at
three of the centres: Crystal Palace in south-east London, Bisham Abbey in
Buckinghamshire and Lilleshall in Shropshire. Ciystal Palace provides major
competition venues for athletics and swimming and a variety of indoor sports,
and Lilleshall houses the training school of the Football Association. The other
two are specialist centres: the National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierre-
pont, Nottinghamshire, which caters for rowing, canoeing and water-skiing;
and the Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain Activities in north Wales.
The Sports Council for Wales runs the National Sports Centre for Wales in
Cardiff and the National Outdoor Pursuits Centre at Plas Menai in north Wales.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore fqr outdoor pursuits, Inverclyde at Largs for
general sports, and a national water sports training centre on Great Cumbrae
Isle in the Firth of Clyde. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland operates one
national facility, the Northern Ireland Mountain Centre at Tollymore in County
Down.
There are some 1,500 swimming pools and 1,000 sports centres serving local
rather than national needs; in Northern Ireland there has been a major
development of multi-purpose centres. Several privately run centres cater for
specialised interests, such as the British Equestrian Centre, run by the British
Horse Society, and the Ludwig Guttmann Sports Centre for the Disabled, Stoke
Mandeville.
The Minister for Sport has responsibility for co-ordinating policy on children's
play. The Department of Education and Science is concerned with play in
schools, and the Department of Health and Social Security with play for the
under-fives. The Sports Council provides a central service to assist voluntary
organisations to develop opportunities for children's play and recreation.
The National Playing Fields Association is a charity with a Royal Charter whose
purpose is to preserve, improve and acquire playing fields, playgrounds and play
space where they are most needed, in particular for children, young people and
handicapped people. There are affiliated associations in the counties of England
and Wales and branches in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.

The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, is the National Olympic
Committee for the United Kingdom and its primary function is to organise the
participation of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association comprises
representatives of the 29 governing bodies of those sports in the programme of
the Olympic Games (summer and winter). It determines the size of the British
teams, raises funds, makes all arrangements and provides a headquarter staff
for the management of the teams. It has established the British Olympic Medical
Centre, which provides a sport-medical back-up service for competitors before
and during Olympic Games. The Association has an education programme
aimed at encouraging interest in the Olympic Games and to foster the aims and
ideals of the Olympic movement in Britain.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, is the
co-ordinating body of sport and recreation for people with all forms of disability.
The Association, which receives an annual Sports Council grant, encourages all
categories of disabled people, including the mentally handicapped, to take part
in physical recreation and sport for pleasure and as an aid to rehabilitation and
integration with the able-bodied community. It also seeks to secure the
provision and improvement of facilities in consultation with national and local
authorities.
In 1986 the Council of Europe adopted a European Charter on Sport for All
Disabled Persons designed to facilitate participation in sport by disabled people.
The Charter makes recommendations to both governments and sporting bodies
concerning the financing of sporting activities for disabled people; their
representation on sports policy-making bodies; steps to be taken towards
integration into traditional sports clubs and organisations; the training of
qualified staff; and the encouragement of the training of disabled people as
physical education teachers and coaches.
Sports clubs for disabled people throughout Britain are affiliated to the
Association, which helps to organise sporting and physical activities at all levels,
including national and international meetings. At present it co-ordinates the
activities of seven major disability sports organisations and, on behalf of 450
member clubs, provides regional and national championships in 12 sports. As
well as offering advice to local clubs and groups, the Association arranges
conferences, seminars and coaching courses, and acts as a co-ordinating body
for the various disability groups. It serves as the focal point for national team
management and selection at world and Paralympic levels, and organises world
events on behalf of international bodies. The Scottish Sports Association for the
Disabled and the Welsh Committee on Sport for the Disabled have similar
co-ordinating roles in Scotland and Wales.
The first sports stadium in the world designed for disabled people was opened
at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, in 1969, and is owned and maintained
by the British Paraplegic Sports Society. Annual national games organised by
several of the associations for the disabled take place at Stoke Mandeville,
Crystal Palace in London and at other locations; the Seventh World Wheelchair
Games (or Paralympics) were held at Stoke Mandeville in 1984.
The problem of drug-taking in sport in order to achieve unfair improvements in
performance has been a cause of concern both to the Sports Councils and to the
governing bodies of sport. A continuous campaign to tackle the problem,
launched by the Sports Council, includes the introduction in all competitive
sports of random drug-testing procedures which can lead to a life ban for
offending competitors. In Scotland the governing bodies of over 85 per cent of
competitive sports have voluntarily introduced testing. The Sports Council
finances the analysis of samples taken in Britain and some from abroad and

funds research into methods of detection for new drugs that unfairly aid
performance. An official report published in September 1987 has recommended
the institution of a new and strengthened regime for drug testing as well as
tough and consistent penalties for offenders.
The Government and the Sports Council have also taken firm action at
international level by supporting the adoption of a European Anti-Doping
Charter and by chairing an international working party to examine ways of
promoting effective anti-doping measures.
Some of the major sports and recreations in Britain are described below. The
increased provision of sports centres has improved opportunities for participa¬
tion in indoor sports such as basketball, volleyball, fencing, judo, karate and
other martial arts, gymnastics, squash, table tennis and shooting. Almost all
outdoor sports have continued to gain in popularity, including the ‘high-risk'
activities such as rock-climbing and sub-aqua diving. The number of people
enjoying the recreational amenities of the countryside, rivers and coastline is
similarly growing. Two sports introduced from overseas in the 1970s which have
gained rapidly in popularity are board sailing and hang-gliding; the flying of
microlight aircraft is one of the newest sports to achieve a keen following.
Sportsmen may be professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports,
such as rugby union, hockey and rowing, are amateur but in others the
distinction between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined, or
does not exist. The Amateur Athletic Association, for example, allows payments
to be made into trust funds held by many top-ranking athletes.
The most popular country sport is fishing, and there are about 4 million anglers
in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout, particularly in the rivers and lochs of
Scotland and in Wales, but in England and Wales the most widely practised form
of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, tench and bream. There
are separate organisations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for
game (salmon and trout), coarse and sea fishing clubs which are co-ordinated in
England and Wales by the National Anglers' Council. The National Federation of
Anglers in England organises national championships for coarse fishing and
enters a team in the world angling championships. In 1985 England won both
the world team and individual events. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid
for: most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners, while trout and
salmon fishermen may rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to
fish by the day, week or month. Coastal and deep-sea fishing are free to all (apart
from salmon and sea trout fishing which is by licence only).
The largest spectator sport and one of the most popular participation sports,
association football was first developed and codified in England during the
nineteenth century, and is controlled by separate football associations in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England over 335 clubs are
affiliated to the English Football Association (FA) and over 40,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. The full-time professional clubs in England and
Wales belong to the Football League (92 clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish
Football League (38 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in England and Wales
and three in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, 14 semi-professional clubs play in
the Irish Football League. During the season, which lasts from August until
May, attendances at over 2,000 English league matches total about 18 million.
The Football Association, founded in 1863, and the Football League, founded in
1888, were both the first of their kind in the world.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Littlewoods Challenge
Cup (formerly the League Cup), the Scottish FA Cup, the Skol Cup (formerly the
SPORT AND RECREATION
437
Athletics
Scottish League Cup), the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals are played at Wembley Stadium, London, at
Hampden Park, Glasgow, at Windsor Park, Belfast, and on a two-match home
and away basis in Wales. British clubs were European club champions
(Liverpool three times, Nottingham Forest twice and Aston Villa once) for six
consecutive years between 1977 and 1982, and Liverpool became champions
again in 1984. Aberdeen won the European Cup-Winners Cup in 1983, as did
Everton in 1985; Ipswich Town and Tottenham Hotspur won the Union of
European Football Associations (UEFA) cup competition in 1981 and 1984
respectively.
The Sports Councils have made grants to a number of clubs and local
authorities to enable them to modernise or expand football facilities in areas of
urban deprivation. Grants for various improvements such as all-weather pitches
are also made throughout Britain by the Football Associations and the Football
Trust, a body financed by the football pools (see p 445) companies; the Football
Grounds Improvement Trust, is specifically concerned with ground safety.
Spectator violence associated with football both in Britain and overseas has
been a subject of widespread concern, and the Government has worked closely
with the football authorities and the governments of other European countries
to combat the problem. After serious disturbances involving English supporters
at the European Cup Final in Brussels in 1985 which led to the deaths of 38
spectators, English clubs were withdrawn from European competitions for the
1985—86 season by the Football Association; an indefinite ban on the clubs was
subsequently imposed by UEFA. Britain has signed a Council of Europe
Convention, adopted in 1985, which is designed to eliminate spectator violence
at all sporting events, including football. The Government has restricted the sale
of alcohol in football grounds and banned its sale on transport to matches, and it
is an offence to take cans or bottles into grounds.
Under new public order legislation, the courts have powers to ban convicted
hooligans from football matches, and a new offence of disorderly conduct has
been created covering behaviour which, while not in itself violent, causes
unnecessary distress to others. Possession of smoke bombs and fireworks at or
on entry to a football ground has also become an offence. Greater use is being
made of closed-circuit television, and Football League clubs in England and
Wales have been asked by the Government to introduce membership schemes
for specific areas of their grounds by the beginning of the 1987—88 season.
Amateur athletics is governed in England by the Amateur Athletic Association
(which, formed in 1880, was the first national governing body for athletics) and
by the Women's Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland have their own associations. International athletics and the selection of
British teams are the concern of the Amateur Athletic Association, which also
administers coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games and the world and
European championships one team represents the United Kingdom.
Athletics is attracting increasing numbers of participants, both men and
women, in part because of the success of British competitors and the wide
coverage of athletics events on television.
Many British athletes, especially middle-distance runners, have enjoyed
distinguished reputations: in 1954, for example. Dr Roger Bannister became
the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. Britain has one world
champion (Fatima Whitbread in the women’s javelin) and three Olympic
champions (Sebastian Coe in the 1,500 metres, Daley Thompson in the
decathlon and Tessa Sanderson in the women's javelin). In August 1987 Britons
held world records in the 800 metres (Sebastian Coe), the mile (Steve Cram) and
the decathlon (Daley Thompson).

Scottish Highland Games, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting
the weight and throwing the hammer), dancing and piping competitions take
place, attract large numbers of spectators from all over the world. Among
better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar Gathering, the Argyll¬
shire and Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
The origins of badminton are not clear, but the Badminton Association of
England, which together with the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Badminton Unions
today organises the sport in Britain, was formed in 1893 and the first
tournament was promoted five years later. Badminton expanded rapidly in the
1970s and is played in a variety of locations from sports centres to village halls;
up to 2 million people are estimated to play the game in Britain, about 1 million
of them regularly. Some 6,250 clubs are affiliated to the four governing bodies
and the Badminton Association of England organises the All England Cham¬
pionships each year. The England women's team won a silver medal, and the
men's a bronze at the 1984 world team championships. The English team (men
and women) are reigning Commonwealth Games champions.
Basketball is played in Britain both indoors and outdoors. There are about
1,100 registered clubs and the sport is played in most secondary schools and
many other institutions; in all, over 1 million people participate and its
popularity has been increasing rapidly. The English Basket Ball Association is
the governing body of the sport in England, and there are similar associations in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The leading English clubs play in a
Premier League and the main events of the year are the Carlsberg National
Championship Finals, held at Wembley Arena in London, and the men’s
Prudential National Cup Final, staged at the Royal Albert Hall.
The character of the present game of billiards was established in Britain at the
end of the seventeenth century. Snooker, a more varied game invented by the
British in India in 1875, has greatly increased in popularity and become a major
spectator sport as a result of widespread television coverage of the professional
tournaments. It is estimated that between 5 and 6 million people now play the
game. British players have an outstanding record in snooker and the major
professional championships have been largely dominated by them. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World Professional Championship, held
in Sheffield; British winners of this event include Steve Davis (1981, 1983,
1984 and 1987), Joe Johnson (1986), Dennis Taylor (1985) and Alex Higgins
(1972 and 1982). Northern Ireland won the world team championship in
1984, 1985 and 1987, as did England in 1981 and 1983.
The controlling body for the non-professional game is the Billiards and
Snooker Control Council, which holds the copyright of the rules. The World
Professional Billiards and Snooker Association is responsible for professional
players, and it organises professional events.
Bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. The game of lawn
bowls is played on a flat green; in the midlands and north of England and in
North Wales a variation called crown green bowls is played, so named because
the centre of the green is higher than its boundaries. Lawn and crown green
bowls are mainly summer games; in winter indoor bowls, played on synthetic
greens, is growing in popularity. At one time regarded as a pastime for the
elderly, bowls is increasingly played by adults of all ages. Some 4,000 lawn
bowling clubs are affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Northern
Ireland Region) Bowling Associations, which, together with the Women's
Bowling Associations for the four countries, play to the rules of the International

Bowling Board. Other associations, including the English Bowling Federation,
are not under the Board's control. The British Crown Green Bowling Association
is the governing body of crown green bowls, and has 2,500 affiliated clubs.
The outstanding player is David Bryant who, since 1957, has held 24 singles
championships.
Boxing in its modern form, which has been adopted in many overseas countries,
dates from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules
eliminating much of the brutality that had characterised prize-fighting and
making skill the basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional,
and in both strict medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England, including schoolboy, club, association and
combined services boxing (in the armed forces), is controlled by the Amateur
Boxing Association. England is divided into eight associations and Scotland and
Wales have separate associations; Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish
Boxing Association. The associations organise amateur boxing championships
as well as training courses for referees, coaches and others, and teams take part
in international meetings including the Commonwealth Games and European
and world championships; a British team competes in the Olympic Games.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints inspectors, medical officers and representatives to ensure that
regulations are observed and to guard against overmatching and exploitation.
British boxing has a distinguished record and at various times British boxers
have held European, Commonwealth and world championship titles; Lloyd
Honeyghan is the current holder of the International Boxing Federation (IBF)
and World Boxing Council world welterweight titles, while Terry Marsh holds the
IBF light welterweight world title.
Chess has increased greatly in popularity and England ranks among the top
chess-playing nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are separately
represented), having 11 Grandmasters at present. There are local chess clubs
and leagues throughout the country and the game is widely played in schools
and colleges. Important domestic competitions include the Kleinwort Grieveson
British Championships, the Peterborough Software National Club Cham¬
pionships, the Leigh Grand Prix, the Pergamon British Lightning Cham¬
pionship and The Times British Schools Chess Tournament. The best-known
international event is the Foreign and Colonial Hastings Chess Congress. The
governing bodies of the game are the British Chess Federation, the Scottish
Chess Association (the oldest such body in the world, which celebrated its
centenary in 1984) and the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game, having been played as early as the 1550s. Among the
many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC), which reframed the laws of the game. The Club is based at Lord’s cricket
ground in north London, the administrative centre of the world game. Men’s
cricket in Britain is now governed by the Cricket Council, consisting of
representatives of the Test and County Cricket Board (representing first-class
cricket), the National Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket)
the Minor County Cricket Association, the Scottish Cricket Union, the Irish
Cricket Union and the MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns and
villages amateur teams play weekly games from late April to the end of
September. Throughout Britain there is a network of league cricket contested by
teams of Saturday afternoon players.

Field Sports
The main competition in professional cricket is the Britannic Assurance
County Championship of three-day and four-day games played by 17 county
teams, which also take part in three one-day competitions—the Benson and
Hedges Cup, the National Westminster Bank Trophy, and the Refuge Assurance
League played on Sundays. Some of the best supported games are the annual
series of five-day Cornhill Test matches played between England and a touring
team from Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka or the West
Indies. A team representing England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the British winter. Texaco Trophy one-day international games also
attract large crowds. A World Cup is played every four years, with some of the
smaller cricketing nations as well as the major countries competing: India and
Pakistan will jointly hold the next one in October 1987.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women's Cricket Association, founded in 1926. Women's cricket clubs have
regular weekend local fixtures and participate in an annual national club
knockout competition. The game is also played at county level and Test match
series are played by England against Australia. India, New Zealand and the West
Indies. A women's World Cup, in which England competes, is held every four
years.
Since the 1970s there has been a substantial resurgence of interest in cycling,
both as a means of transportation and as a sport and recreation, and this has led
central and local government to make greater provision for cycling. Cycling
activities include road and track racing, cycle speedway, time-trialling, cross¬
country racing, touring, bicycle polo and bicycle moto-cross.
The British Cycling Federation acts as the governing body for cycling as a
sport, while the Cyclists' Touring Club, formed in 1878, is the national
association for recreational cycling and represents cyclists' interests in general.
The Scottish Cyclists Union controls the sport in Scotland.
Darts, an indoor game which has its origins in medieval archery, is played
mainly in public houses as a casual recreation to accompany drinking. It has
gained in popularity as a result of widespread television coverage of the
professional game. It is estimated that about 4 million people play the game
regularly. Darts is organised in Britain by the British Darts Organisation, which
forms part of the World Darts Federation; its rules have become the code for the
world sport. The Organisation arranges events in Britain which bring entrants
from as many as 45 countries. Every two years a World Cup tournament is held,
which England won in 1985 in Brisbane. The main individual title in the game
is the Embassy World Professional Championship. British players have domi¬
nated the event and in 1987 the title was won by John Lowe.
British field sports include hunting (on horseback and on foot), fishing,
shooting, stalking, falconry and hare coursing. Fox hunting on horseback with
a pack of hounds is the most popular British hunting sport, and there are over
400 packs of hounds of all kinds in Britain.
Game shooting as an organised sport probably originated in the early part of
the nineteenth century, and takes place in many parts of Britain. Game consists
of grouse, black-grouse, partridge, pheasant and ptarmigan, species which are
protected by law during a close season when they are allowed to breed on
numerous estates supervised by gamekeepers. It is necessary to have a licence to
kill game and a certificate issued by the police to own a shot-gun.
The British Field Sports Society and the British Association for Shooting and
Conservation look after the interests of all field sports. Public opposition to field
sports is not inconsiderable and is organised through such bodies as the League
Against Cruel Sports.

Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game. The Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh, the oldest
club in the world, celebrated its 250th anniversary in 1985. The Royal and
Ancient Golf Club, the ruling authority of the sport for most of the world, is
situated at St Andrews on the east coast. Golf is played throughout Britain and
there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns, some of them owned by local
authorities. The main event of the British golfing year, and considered by many
to be the world s leading tournament, is the Open Golf Championship; other
important events include the Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup
match for professionals, which are played between Britain and the United States
and Europe and the United States respectively. Among the leading British
professional players are Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Mark James, Howard Clark, Ian
Woosnam, Bernard Gallagher, Sam Torrance and Laura Davies.
Variants of hockey have been played in Britain for at least five centuries, and
some, like hurling in Ireland and shinty in Scotland, are still played. The modern
game was started in the nineteenth century by the Hockey Association (of
England), which was founded in 1886. There are similar associations in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Some 1,000 men's hockey clubs are located
throughout Britain, many of which have women's and junior sections; large
numbers of boys' schools also play the game. Cup competitions and leagues are
played at national, division or district, and club levels both indoors (six-a-side)
and outdoors, and there are regular international matches.
The controlling body of women's hockey in England is the All-England
Women's Hockey Association (founded in 1895) to which are affiliated some
1,000 clubs and about 2,400 schools; there are similar associations in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland. County, club and school championships for both outdoor and
indoor hockey are played annually in England. The first international women’s
hockey match took place in 1896: nowadays the main international match is
played each year at Wembley Stadium.
Men's and women's hockey are Olympic sports, and the British men's team
won a bronze medal at the 1984 Olympic Games.
England won a silver medal in the sixth World Hockey Cup for men in 1986
held at the national hockey centre in Willesden, north London.
Ice skating became popular in Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries and takes three main forms: ice dancing, figure skating and
speed-skating. The governing body for the sport is the National Skating
Association of Great Britain, founded in 1879. Participation in ice skating is
concentrated among the under-25s. There are over 40 ice rinks in Great Britain,
a small number compared with many other European countries. In spite of this,
British couples have won the world ice dance championship 17 times in its
32-year history, and Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean were world ice dance
champions for four successive years between 1981 and 1984, European
champions in 1981, 1982 and 1984, and gold medal winners at the Sarajevo
winter Olympic Games in 1984.
Judo, a modern combat sport derived from the ancient Japanese arts of ju-jutsu,
is growing rapidly in popularity in Britain, both as a sport and general fitness
training method and as a self-defence technique. Men and women take part in
judo at all levels, and in the last four Olympic Games judo has been one of
Britain's most successful sports. Recent leading British exponents of the sport
include Karen Briggs, Brian Jacks, Neil Adams, Neil Eckersley, Ann Hughes and
Diane Bell. More than 1,200 judo clubs are registered with the British Judo

The modern game of lawn tennis originated in England in 1872 and the first
championships were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body in
Great Britain, the Lawn Tennis Association, was founded in 1888: Northern
Ireland forms part of the Irish Lawn Tennis Association. The main event of the
season is the annual Wimbledon fortnight, widely regarded as the most
important tennis event in the world: this draws large crowds, with the ground at
the All England Club accommodating over 30,000 spectators. There are also
national and county championships and national competitions for boys' and
girls' schools. International events include the Davis Cup and European Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete annually for the Wightman Cup.
Motor racing and rallying, and motor-cycle racing, are popular spectator sports
in Britain. The governing body for four-wheeled motor sport is the RAC [Royal
Automobile Club] Motor Sports Association. The Association issues competition
licences for a variety of motoring competitions and organises both the RAC
Rally, an event in the contest for the World Rally Championship, and the British
Grand Prix, held in alternate years at the Silverstone and Brands Hatch racing
circuits as part of the Formula One World Motor Racing Championship.
British car constructors including Lotus, McLaren and Williams have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing, and Britain has had six world
champion motor racing drivers: Nigel Mansell and Derek Warwick are among the
most successful of current drivers. Other popular types of motor-car sport
include autocross, drag racing and karting.
Motor-cycle sport, governed by the Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales
and the Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and Motor Cycle Union of Ireland (in i
Northern Ireland), caters for all forms of competition on two or three wheels,
from low-speed trials to Grand Prix road racing. The major events of the year are
the Isle of Man TT races, the British Road Race Grand Prix and other world
championship events for trials, motor-cross, speedway and track racing. The !
Auto-Cycle Union provides training for young riders under 17 years of age.
The popularity of mountaineering and rock-climbing has increased steadily.
Clubs in the British Mountaineering Council and the Mountaineering Council of
Scotland, the representative bodies of the sport, number 330, ranging from
national clubs such as the Alpine Club (founded in 1857, the oldest moun¬
taineering club in the world) and the Scottish Mountaineering Club to small
regional clubs with 20 to 30 members. The National Centre for Mountain
Activities is at Plas-y-Brenin in north Wales, and climbing takes place at other
centres managed by the Sports Councils at Plas Menai (north Wales), Glenmore
Lodge near Aviemore in Scotland and Tollymore in Northern Ireland. A number
of local education authorities and national bodies such as the Outward Bound
Trust have also established mountaineering training centres. The most popular
areas in Britain for climbing include the Peak District of Derbyshire, the Lake
District, Snowdonia in north Wales and the Western Highlands of Scotland.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring mountain ranges
and climbing many of the great mountains of the world, achieving, for example,
the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, Everest in 1953, Kangchenjunga in
1955, Everest by its south-west face in 1975, and the south face of Gosainthan
(in the Himalayas) in 1982.
SPORT AND RECREATION
443
Racing
Riding
Horse-racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early November)
and steepleehasing and hurdle racing (from late August to^early June). The
Derby, run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other
classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket: the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St Leger, run at
Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival Meeting held at Cheltenham in March. The Grand
National, run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the world’s best-known steeplechase
and dates from 1837.
The Jockey Club administers all horse-racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis
of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses. Racing takes place on most
days (excluding Sundays) throughout the year and about 12,500 horses are in
training. British thoroughbreds continue to be a source of the world’s best
bloodstock.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (one of Britain’s most
popular spectator sports) takes place at 91 tracks licensed by local authorities.
Meetings are usually held two or three times a week at each track with at least
ten races a meeting. The rules for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club, the sport's judiciary body. The Stewards of the Club are
also responsible for overall administration and organisation. The representative
body is the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Horse riding takes a number of forms ranging from recreational riding to show
jumping. The art of riding is promoted by the British Horse Society, which is
concerned with the welfare of horses, road safety, bridleways and training. It
also runs the British Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. With
some 38,000 members the Society is the parent body of the Pony Club and the
Riding Club movements, which hold rallies, meetings and competitions
culminating in annual national championships. Horse trials are held during the
spring and autumn under the auspices of the Society. Three-day events
(comprising dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping) held each year
include those at Badminton (Avon), Windsor (Berkshire), Bramham (Yorkshire),
Burghley House (Lincolnshire), and Wylye (Wiltshire).
Showjumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association, which
has over 15,000 members and some 1,820 shows affiliated to it. The major show
jumping events each year include the Royal International Horse Show at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London, and the Olympia International Show Jumping Cham¬
pionships in London.
The authority responsible for equestrian competitions (other than racing) at
international level is the British Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates the
events of the British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association.
British equestrian teams have an outstanding record in international competi¬
tions: a British team won the three-day event world championship held in
Australia in 1986, and Virginia Leng won the individual gold medal. The British
showjumping team won the team silver medal at the 1986 world championships
and Nick Skelton won the individual bronze medal. Silver medals were won by
both the three-day event and the showjumping teams at the 1984 Olympic
Games, while Virginia Leng won the bronze medal in the three-day individual
competition.
Oarsmanship is taught in many schools, colleges and rowing clubs (including
women's clubs) throughout Britain. The governing body of the sport in England
is the Amateur Rowing Association, and there are similar bodies in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. There are about 500 rowing clubs, and each year

The University Boat Race (between eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge) originated in 1829 and has been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River Race (also on the Thames) is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with more than 420 eights racing in
procession. At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire, founded in 1839, crews from
all over the world compete each July in various kinds of race over a straight
course of 1 mile 550 yards (about 21 km).
The National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham, has
a rowing course of Olympic 2,000-metre standard, as does Strathclyde Park in
west-central Scotland. Britain won the gold medal in the coxed fours event at the
1984 Olympic Games.
Rugby football takes its name from Rugby School, in Warwickshire, where it was
first played in 1823. The game is played according to two different codes: rugby
union (a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while rugby league (a 13-a-side
game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs. Rugby union is played
under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union in England and similar bodies
in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Important domestic competitions include the
Divisional and County Championships in England, the national club knock-out
competitions in England and Wales and the Scottish League Cup Cham¬
pionship. The Five Nations Tournament between England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland and France is played each year and there are overseas tours by the
national sides and by the British Lions, a team representing Great Britain and
Ireland. In May and June 1987, teams from 16 countries competed for the first
time for the Webb Ellis Trophy in a tournament in Australia and New Zealand.
Rugby league is played mainly in the north of England. The governing body of
the professional game is the Rugby Football League, which sends touring teams
representing Great Britain to Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea;
annual matches are also played against France. The Challenge Cup Final, the
major club match of the season, is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The
amateur game is governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association:
matches between England and France take place each year. A national league
consisting of ten leading clubs was launched in 1986.
Sailing has always been popular in Britain, and the Royal Yachting Association
(RYA) has more than 1,500 affiliated clubs and classes. Over 1,000 practical or
shore-based teaching centres offer RYA and RYA Scotland courses in sailing,
windsurfing and navigation and over 50,000 people attend each year. One of the
world’s principal regattas takes place each summer at Cowes, and major events
are held at other sailing centres. British sailors have undertaken many notable
voyages. Sir Francis Chichester was the winner of the first single-handed
transatlantic race in 1960 and made a solo circumnavigation of the world in
1966—67. The first non-stop solo circumnavigation was achieved by Robin
Knox-Johnston in 1968. In 1976 Clare Francis held the record for the fastest
single-handed crossing of the Atlantic, as did Naomi James in 1980. Jo
Richards and his crew Peter Allam won a bronze medal in the ‘Flying Dutchman’
class in the 1984 Olympics.
Board sailing, recognised as a type of yachting, has grown rapidly in
popularity since its introduction into Britain in 1974. Penny Way is the women’s
world windsurfing champion title-holder.
Skiing
When there is sufficient snow, skiing takes place in several parts of Britain. The
governing body of the sport is the British Ski Federation and there are separate

national councils. Skiing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the
winter sports centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and
Glenshee, where ski-runs equal to those in other areas of Europe have been
developed. Ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction of a high quality are
now available. There are also some 100 artificial ski-slopes throughout Great
Britain. Interest in cross-country skiing has been increasing. There are nearly
300 ski clubs in Britain, and it is estimated that about half a million people take
part in the sport.
Squash rackets originated at Harrow School in the 1850s. The Squash Rackets
Association was formed in 1928 to promote and organise the men’s game and
there are separate governing bodies for Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The
governing body of women's squash in England is the Women's Squash Rackets
Association, founded in 1934. Squash enjoyed a period of very rapid growth
during the 1970s and remains a popular sport. There are 9,000 squash courts
in England, and the estimated number of players in Britain is about 3 million.
The main tournament is the British Open Championship.
Underwater activities are varied and include exploratory diving (for example,
wreck and reef diving), snorkel diving and underwater photography. The British
Sub-Aqua Club is the governing body for all underwater activities and promotes
underwater exploration, science and sport. The Club is the largest of its kind in
the world, with some 35,000 members and more than 1,000 clubs in Britain and
overseas. The Scottish Sub-Aqua Club governs the sport in Scotland.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn to
swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
(Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association) to
which nearly 2,000 clubs are affiliated. The Associations also control swimming,
diving, synchronised swimming and water polo championships and competi¬
tions. For major international competitions, such as the Olympic Games and the
world and European championships, England, Scotland and Wales compete
together as one team under the auspices of the Great Britain Amateur
Swimming Federation. At the 1984 Olympics, Britons won a silver and four
bronze medals and at the 1986 world championships two bronze medals.
Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted in Britain under
strict regulations. Spending on gambling fell by about 40 per cent in real terms
in the ten years to 1985; in 1985—86 the total money staked (excluding gaming
machines) was about £6,870 million.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and card games, gaming machines and
registrable bingo. Betting takes place mainly on horse or greyhound racing, and
on football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be made at
racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 10,400 licensed off-course
betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked. A form of pool
betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB contribute a levy to the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, which promotes the improvement of horse racing
and breeding and the advancement of veterinary science.
In addition, legislation allows local authorities and certain other bodies to
hold lotteries.
